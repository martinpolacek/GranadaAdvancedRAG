      "▪ The work is and is usually carried out on their premises, under their full and direct\n",

      "provisions of the Grant Agreement itself (e.g. amendment to subcontract tasks of the\n",
      "coordinator).\n",
      "Characteristics of amendments:\n",
      "▪ Can only be done in writing — a verbal agreement is not binding on the parties\n",

      "▪ Has to be signed by persons having the same capacity to represent the legal entity\n",

      "the Grant Agreement.\n",
      "2. Beneficiary B moves from Europe to Australia during the action. The change of address implies\n",

      "Example: The coordinator requests an amendment to change its bank account number and the\n",
      "reallocation of tasks in Annex 1 and of budget in Annex 2. Since the change of bank account is\n",
      "urgent because the Commission has to make the interim payment and the revision of the Annexes\n",

      "may — exceptionally — be before (retroactivity of the amendment). In some cases, the Grant\n",

      "1. Where a new beneficiary is added to the Grant Agreement (AT3), it must assume the rights and\n",
      "obligations from the accession date specified in the Accession Form. If this date is before the entry\n",
      "into force of the amendment, this retroactivity implies that its costs will be considered eligible as\n",

      "amendment (AT26). This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force\n",
      "(see Article 31.2.2).\n",
      "3. If the amendment intends to correct an error (AT60), the change will be made with effect from\n",
      "entry into force of the Grant Agreement (i.e. from the beginning).\n",
      "Depending on the amendment clause, the date of taking effect may have an impact on the\n",
      "eligibility of costs.\n",
      "Amendment request involving several changes, may take effect on different dates.\n",
      "Example: On 1 May 2022, the coordinator requests an amendment to change the bank account\n",
      "and to add a new beneficiary. The addition of the beneficiary takes effect from the date of its\n",
      "accession, as specified in the Accession Form (1 April 2022), while the change of bank account\n",
      "takes effect on a date agreed by the parties or on the date on which the amendment enters into\n",

      "Specific cases (amendments):\n",
      "Budget transfers — Only the budget transfers that imply a change of Annex 2 (or one of its\n",
      "Annexes 2a-2e) require an amendment. Other transfers are covered by the budget flexibility\n",
      "principle and normally do NOT need an amendment (see Article 5.5).\n",
      "Examples (no need for amendment):\n",
      "1. During the action implementation, a beneficiary that declared its direct personnel costs as actual\n",
      "costs decides to change this and instead to declare them as unit costs in accordance with its usual\n",
      "accounting practices (average personnel costs), which is allowed in its Grant Agreement.\n",
      "2. An SME joins an on-going GA. The SME owner does not have a salary but incorrectly budgets its\n",

      "- minimum number of days that the PI must work in the action over its duration\n",
      "- minimum number of days that the PI must work in an EU Member State or HE\n",
      "associated country over the duration of the action.\n",
      "The calculation should be done as follows:\n",
      "Step 1 — For each year of the action, the percentages of PI commitment are applied to\n",
      "215 fixed annual days.\n",
      "The 215 fixed annual days work as a ceiling: they apply even if the PI works in total\n",
      "more days (i.e. has other parallel affiliations, freelance activities or work-related\n",
      "obligations or works more days on the action). In this case, the time commitment is\n",
      "capped at 100% and the days are calculated on the 215 fixed annual days.\n",
      "By contrast, if the PI works in total less days than the 215 fixed annual days, the time\n",
      "commitment obligation will be reduced proportionally (e.g. in cases of part-time\n",
      "employment, maternity leave, sick leave…).\n",
      "The total work of the PI will be determined by adding up all their days of remunerated\n",
      "work, including under contracts with entities other than the host institution.\n",
      "Example: The % of PI commitment to the ERC action is 50%. The PI works 129 annual days at\n",
      "the host institution and has another contract with a different entity to work 35 days over the\n",
      "year. The days that the PI works in total are 164 days (129 + 35). Since this amount is lower\n",
      "than the 215 fixed annual days, the time commitment obligation will be: 164 x 50 % = 82 days\n",
      "427EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025\n",
      "Step 2 — Sum up the results for each year of Step 1 to get the total number of days over\n",
      "the action duration.\n",
      "The percentages must be reached for the overall action duration (NOT annually or per\n",
      "reporting period).\n",
      "The PI's time commitments obligations must ALWAYS be fulfilled — even if no personnel\n",
      "costs are charged for them to the project.\n",
      "6. Transfer of the GA (portability) (HE)\n",
      "Portability means that the PIs have a right to request the transfer of their grant to a new host\n",
      "institution — provided that the objectives of the action remain achievable and that the new\n",
      "host institution meets the eligibility criteria set out in the ERC work programme/call\n",
      "conditions.\n",
      "Portability allows the PI to request the transfer of the entire grant or part of it, and it applies\n",
      "both in case of mono-beneficiary grants and multi-beneficiary grants. In ERC Synergy Grants\n",
      "(i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs), each PI has the right to transfer their part\n",
      "of the action. They must inform and consult the other PIs, to ensure that the action’s\n",
      "objectives can still be achieved.\n",
      "ERC grants can thus be transferred to a new host institution (‘new beneficiary’) — at any time\n",
      "during the action.\n",
      "Transfers without a formal amendment are void and may result in grant termination. The\n",
      "former host institution remains fully responsible until the granting authority has approved the\n",
      "amendment.\n",
      "The transfer may be based on any ground that is beneficial for the PI and does not affect the\n",
      "achievement of the action’s objectives.\n",
      "The transfer may be refused, if the objectives of the action do not remain achievable or if\n",
      "there is an issue with eligibility (e.g. if the PI requests a transfer to an institution established\n",
      "in a non-associated third country). In this case the Grant Agreement may be terminated (see\n",
      "Article 32). Exceptions, in line with the applicable ERC work programme/call conditions, may\n",
      "apply for ERC Synergy Grants.\n",
      "In addition, the former host institution (‘former beneficiary’) may oppose a transfer if it is not\n",
      "allowed under national law.\n",
      "The transfer conditions (including transfer of team members, intellectual property rights and\n",
      "equipment) should be negotiated with the new host institution, taking into account the views\n",
      "of the PI.\n",
      "Amendment procedure:\n",
      "Portability transfers are done directly in the Portal Amendment tool as in/out amendment\n",
      "(AT4 beneficiary termination is combined with AT1 Addition of a new beneficiary; see Article\n",
      "39; new for 2021-2027).\n",
      "The procedure is therefore in principle the one for consortium-initiated partner terminations\n",
      "(see Article 32).\n",
      "The PI should first contact the host institution that signed the Grant Agreement (i.e. the\n",
      "former host institution).\n",
      "Best practice: Both the beneficiaries and the PI should keep records of the consultation and\n",
      "decision-making process for each portability case.\n",
      "428EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025\n",
      "The former host institution must submit a request for amendment to the granting authority\n",
      "(see Article 39). The amendment should normally cover both the termination of the old host\n",
      "institution and the addition of the new host institution.\n",
      "The termination/addition may exceptionally (and in duly justified cases) not be necessary,\n",
      "if the old host institution remains in the action as normal beneficiary (and the action becomes\n",
      "a multi-beneficiary action), but in this case the amendment will have to do a change of\n",
      "coordinator to change the roles (AT11).\n",
      "The transfer date must be indicated in the amendment request. If the new host institution\n",
      "joins the action, the transfer date must be the same date as the accession date. Retroactive\n",
      "dates may be accepted only in exceptional cases, if duly justified.\n",
      "In addition, the financial reporting periods may be adapted to match the transfer date (can\n",
      "be done in the same amendment). The scientific reporting periods will usually remain\n",
      "unchanged (since the transfer normally has no effect on the scientific implementation of the\n",
      "action).\n",
      "For more guidance on amendments, see the Amendment Guide and the Online Manual >\n",
      "Amendments.\n",
      "Effects:\n",
      "The effects are also those of consortium-initiated partner terminations (see Article 32).\n",
      "The host institution must — within 60 days from either the transfer date or the date of\n",
      "signature of the amendment whichever is the latest — submit:\n",
      "− a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned (only in case of\n",
      "multi-beneficiary grants)\n",
      "− a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period\n",
      "until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial\n",
      "statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate\n",
      "on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)\n",
      "The documents will be used for calculating the next payment due to the former beneficiary.\n",
      "The granting authority will moreover instruct the former host institution to transfer the\n",
      "remaining pre-financing to the new host institution.\n",
      "If the PI requests it, the granting authority may also require the former host institution to\n",
      "transfer equipment that was purchased and used exclusively for the action.\n",
      "The former host institution may oppose this only if it is not possible under national law. It\n",
      "may however negotiate transfer conditions with the new host institution, taking into account\n",
      "the views of the PI.\n",
      "Thus, the new host institution should make its best effort to buy the equipment fully used for\n",
      "the project. If it does so, it may declare the costs of this purchase (and any other related\n",
      "costs, i.e. dismantling, transfer and installation), if they fulfil the eligibility conditions set out\n",
      "in Article 6. In particular, the purchase price should not be higher than the net accounting\n",
      "value of the equipment at the former host institution (i.e. initial value of the asset minus\n",
      "depreciation incurred until the transfer).\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "In order to receive EU funding/tenders (i.e. grants, procurements, prizes,\n",
      "contribution agreements, etc), applicants need to fulfill a certain number of conditions\n",
      "which must be checked before any funding can be awarded to them.\n",
      "Some of these checks are done centrally by the EU Central Validation Service\n",
      "through the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register, set up in accordance with\n",
      "Articles 128 and 147 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/10461 as central repository\n",
      "and electronic data interchange area for participants.\n",
      "This guidance sets out the rules that the Central Validation Service will use for these\n",
      "checks. They currently cover:\n",
      "− legal entity validation (also called ‘PIC validation’)\n",
      "− LEAR appointment\n",
      "− collecting the financial information for the financial capacity assessment (also\n",
      "called ‘FCA’)\n",
      "− ownership control assessment (also called ‘OCA’).\n",
      "For these checks, the participants will be contacted directly by the Central Validation\n",
      "Service and asked to submit the necessary information and supporting documents via\n",
      "the Participant Register. This happens normally during preparation of the first grant,\n",
      "procurement, prize or contribution agreement that successfully passed the evaluation\n",
      "stage, but can also occur later during subsequent applications or in case of changes.\n",
      "All data and documents will be treated as confidential.\n",
      "Personal data will be handled in accordance with Regulation 2018/17252 to ensure\n",
