## Comprehensive Summary of the Joint Transnational Call for Investigator-Initiated Clinical Studies (JTC IICS) – 2025 "EffecTrial"

**1. WHO:**

*   **Organizer:** The "Fostering a European Research Area for Health" (ERA4Health) Partnership, a collaboration between funding organizations in the European Research Area (ERA) including the European Commission. The Joint Call Secretariat (JCS) at the Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII) manages the call.
*   **Eligible Applicants/Target Groups:** Clinical/public health research teams (from hospitals/public health, healthcare settings, and other healthcare organizations) conducting comparative-effectiveness multi-country Investigator-Initiated Clinical Studies (IICS). Eligibility varies by country and funding organization. Applicants must be affiliated with eligible institutions (e.g., research institutes, universities, hospitals) as defined by their respective national/regional funding organizations. Principal Investigators (PIs) must generally hold a Ph.D. or equivalent.

**2. WHAT:**

*   **Type of Program/Call:** Joint Transnational Call for Investigator-Initiated Clinical Studies (JTC IICS).
*   **Focus:** "Fostering Pragmatic Comparative-Effectiveness Trials in Non-communicable Diseases" (EffecTrial).  The call aims to support randomized, interventional, and pragmatic comparative-effectiveness multi-country IICS that compare currently approved healthcare interventions (diagnostic, screening, prevention, and treatment, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches) to each other or to the current standard of care. The focus is on trials related to:
    *   Cardiovascular diseases
    *   Metabolic disorders
    *   Nutrition and lifestyle-related diseases
    *   Non-communicable respiratory diseases

**3. HOW:**

*   **Application Procedure:** A two-step submission process is required:
    *   **Pre-Proposal:** Submitted electronically via the PT-Outline system ([https://ptoutline.eu/app/EffecTrial](https://ptoutline.eu/app/EffecTrial)). The system will be open by November 28th, 2024.
    *   **Full Proposal:**  Only invited consortia will be eligible to submit full proposals via the same system.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   Transnational consortia with 3-5 countries represented (exceptions for Czech Republic and Latvia, allowing 6-7 countries). The maximum number of funding organizations from the same country is 2.
    *   Each consortium must nominate a clinical study coordinator who is not an enterprise.
    *   Clear demonstration of potential health and/or economic impact and added value of transnational clinical collaboration.
    *   Early involvement of 'end-users' (e.g., patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals) in study design and research process.
    *   Adherence to ethical requirements and principles of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI).
    *   Data management according to FAIR principles and compliance with GDPR.
    *   Consideration of sex and gender aspects where applicable.
    *   Submission of national applications or additional information may be required directly to national/regional funding organizations.

    *   To support randomized, interventional, and pragmatic comparative-effectiveness multi-country IICS.
    *   To encourage and enable transnational collaboration between clinical/public health research teams.
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   Provide answers to relevant health research questions regarding clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions.
    *   Inform clinical practice and healthcare policy decisions.
    *   Promote value-based healthcare and evidence-based health policies.
    *   Improve patient quality of life.
    *   Enhance the impact of research for Health Technology Assessments (HTA).
