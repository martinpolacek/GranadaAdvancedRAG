**2. WHAT:**

*   **Type of Program:** Fellowship program for science journalists.
*   **Focus:** Empowering science journalists to deepen their expertise in science coverage, particularly in frontier science, and improve their reporting skills through residencies in research institutions.

**3. HOW:**

*   **Application Procedure:**
    1.  **Select a Topic and Institution:** Identify a relevant frontier science topic and a suitable host research institution and researcher.
    2.  **Write a Strong Proposal:** Develop a clear, original, and feasible proposal outlining objectives, methods, expected impact, and budget.
    3.  **Review and Submit:** Revise the proposal for clarity and conciseness. Submit through the program's online platform, ensuring all documents are formatted correctly and signed where necessary.
*   **Key Requirements for Participants:**
    *   A clear, original proposal idea related to frontier science.
    *   Commitment to completing the fellowship, refraining from working during the period, and attending training workshops.
    *   Detailed information on the selected host researcher and institution, emphasizing the frontier nature of their research.
    *   A clear goal for the fellowship and ideally tangible outcomes

**4. WHY:**

*   **Objectives:**
    *   Advance personal growth and skill development in science journalism.
    *   Foster networking between science journalists and leading researchers/institutions.
    *   Promote nuanced, critical, and impactful coverage of frontier science.
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   Enhanced skills and knowledge in frontier science reporting for participating journalists.
    *   Increased collaboration between journalists and researchers.
    *   More in-depth and accurate public understanding of cutting-edge scientific advancements.
    *   Tangible outcomes (articles, books, podcasts, videos etc) although not mandatory.
    *   Personal growth of journalists

**5. HOW MUCH:**

*   **Support:** All-encompassing funding covering stipend, travel, and other necessary expenses, allowing participants to focus on their projects.

**6. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:**

*   **Duration:** Fellowships are flexible, lasting between 3 and 5 months.
*   **Location:** Residencies may take place in research institutions in any EU Member State or a country associated with the EU's Horizon Europe Programme.
*   **Scientific Scope:** Residency projects may be proposed in all scientific areas, including Humanities and Social Sciences.
*   **Emphasis:** The program is NOT a dissemination or public relations initiative but focuses on independent professional development and accurate storytelling about frontier science.
*   **Multiple Host Institutions:** Possible if justified, with a leading institution meeting frontier science criteria and clear complementary roles for others; all must provide letters of commitment.
*   **Common Mistakes to Avoid:** Vague objectives, ignoring guidelines, misunderstanding frontier science, poor budgeting, messy outline, lacking host institution information, lack of originality, administrative issues.
*   **Deadlines:** Not specified in the document; refer to the official call for applications for the deadline.
