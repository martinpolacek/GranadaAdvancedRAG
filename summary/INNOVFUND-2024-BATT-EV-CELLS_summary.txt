**1. WHO:**

*   **Organizing:** European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) manages the Innovation Fund call.
*   **Eligible Applicants:** Legal entities (public or private bodies) established in any country in the world, who have the financial and operational capacity. *Note:* Certain restrictions apply for specific actions and security reasons. Natural persons are not eligible unless self-employed. International organizations are eligible.

**2. WHAT:**

*   **Type:** EU Action Grant under the Innovation Fund. Focus is demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The INNOVFUND-2024-BATT call contributes to the objectives of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP Regulation 2024/795).
*   **Focus (INNOVFUND-2024-BATT-EV-CELLS):** Manufacturing of electric vehicle battery cells. Optional inclusion of upstream components production (cathode precursor material (pCAM), cathode active material (CAM), anode active material (AAM), electrolyte, separator) and battery or battery material recycling, not exceeding 100% of battery cell production capacity. The call seeks to ramp up electric vehicles, in line with the EU CO2 emissions standards for new passenger cars and for new light and heavy commercial vehicles
*   Expected outcomes include reducing GHG emissions and supporting a climate-neutral economy by 2050. All results/patents must be registered in an EU Member State or EEA country.

**4. WHY:**

*   **Objectives:** Support projects on electric vehicle battery cells manufacturing demonstrating innovative technologies, processes or products, that are sufficiently mature and have a significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   Transition to a climate-neutral economy by 2050.
    *   Reduction of emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990).
    *   Increased investments in EU's electric vehicle battery manufacturing capacity and resilient value chains, in line with the Net Zero Industry Act.

**5. HOW MUCH:**

*   **Amount of Support:** EUR 1 000 000 000
*   **Financial Scope of Projects:** Capital expenditure above EUR 2 500 000 (for INNOVFUND-2024-BATT-EV-CELLS)
*   **Co-financing Rate:** Maximum 60% of the relevant costs.

**6. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:**

*   **Deadline for Submission:** April 24, 2025, at 17:00:00 CET (Brussels time).
