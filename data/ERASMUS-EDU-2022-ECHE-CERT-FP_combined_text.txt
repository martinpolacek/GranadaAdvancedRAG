0. Introduction
This is a call for Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE) quality
certifications under the Erasmus+ Programme.
ECHE sets out the fundamental principles and the minimum requirements with which
higher education institutions (HEIs) must comply when applying for and implementing
activities under the Erasmus + Programme (2021-2027).
The regulatory framework for this EU Funding Programme is set out in:
− Regulation 2018/1046 (EU Financial Regulation)
− the basic act (Erasmus+ Regulation (EU) 2021/817 1).
The call will remain open for the entire programming period 2021-2027 (with yearly
cut-off dates) and will be managed by the European Education and Culture
Executive Agency (EACEA).
We invite you to read the call documentation on the Funding & Tenders Portal Topic
page carefully, and in particular this Call Document, the ECHE Certificate,
the ECHE Guidelines and the EU Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual.
These documents provide clarifications and answers to questions you may have when
preparing your application:
− the Call Document outlines the:
− background, objectives, scope of the certification (section 1)
− timetable (section 2)
− admissibility and eligibility conditions (including mandatory documents;
sections 3 and 4)
− criteria for exclusion (section 5)
− evaluation and award procedure (section 6)
− award criteria (section 7)
− other conditions (section 8)
− the Online Manual outlines the procedures to register and submit applications
online via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’).
− the ECHE Guidelines describe how the ECHE principles should be implemented.
1. Background, objectives and scope
The Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE) is an EU quality certificate for
higher education institutions (HEIs). It is a prerequisite for all HEIs from Erasmus+
Programme countries and Western Balkans third countries not associated to the
Programme to apply for funding under Erasmus+ calls (including calls managed by
Erasmus+ National Agencies).
1 Regulation (EU) 2021/817 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021 establishing
Erasmus+: the Union Programme for education and training, youth and sport and repealing Regulation
(EU) No 1288/2013 (OJ L 189, 28.5.2021, p. 1–33)).

EU Grants: Call document (ERASMUS ECHE Certificate): V1.0 – dd.mm.2021
By applying for the ECHE, the HEI confirms that its participation in Erasmus+ is part
of its strategy for modernisation and internationalisation. This strategy acknowledges
the key contribution of student and staff mobility and of participation in transnational
cooperation projects, to the quality of its higher education programmes and student
experience. The ECHE aims to reinforce the quality of student and staff mobility, as
well as of cooperation projects.
The certification procedure consists in validating the status as a ‘higher education
institution (HEI)’ and certifying compliance with the ECHE quality standards (Erasmus
Policy Statement, quality of organisation and management structures and the
implementation of ECHE principles).
The ECHE will be valid for the entire duration of the Erasmus+ Programme 2021-2027
(and up until the end of projects funded under that Programme). The award of the
ECHE does not automatically imply any direct funding under the Erasmus+
Programme.
ECHE holders will be subject to regular monitoring by the National Agencies.

previous activities. This information is NOT part of the award criteria, but will be used
to verify whether commitments and planned activities are realistic, considering the
institution's profile.
Each award criterion will be scored as fulfilled or not fulfilled (Yes/No). Only
institutions that pass all three criteria will be certified. Other applications will be
rejected.
8. Other conditions
Communication and visibility
ECHE holders must promote the Erasmus+ Programme activities and must display the
Charter prominently on their website (in the official languages of their country and at
least another widely spoken Programme Country language).
Monitoring
ECHE holders will be subject to regular monitoring by the Erasmus+ National
Agencies, on compliance with the ECHE principles. The application Form Part B and
the Evaluation Summary Reports will be shared with the Erasmus+ National Agencies
for monitoring purposes.
If problems are identified, an action plan will be agreed between the holder and the
Erasmus+ National Agency to solve the issues. If the action plan is not properly
implemented (or late) the National Agency will report this to EACEA and this may lead
to the withdrawal of the certificate.
For more information about the monitoring of the ECHE principles, see the ECHE
Monitoring Guide for Erasmus+ National Agencies.
Withdrawal
EACEA may withdraw the certificate if the institution loses its status as ‘higher
education institution’ or no longer complies with the ECHE quality standards.
