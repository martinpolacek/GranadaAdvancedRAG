3European Solidarity Corps Guide
I
NTRODUCTION
This Guide is a tool for anybody who would like to have a thorough knowledge of what the European Solidarity Corps
(referred also as 'Corps' or ‘Programme’) is about. This document is mainly addressed to organisations, institutions, bodies
willing to organise activities under the European Solidarity Corps and young people wishing to get involved in solidarity
activities supported by the Corps.
All rules and conditions for receiving a grant from the European Solidarity Corps are specified in this Guide.
HOW TO READ THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS GUIDE
The Guide has four main parts:
 Part A offers a general overview of the European Solidarity Corps, its scope and structure. It provides information
about its objectives, priorities and main features; eligible countries; implementing structures and the overall
budget available.
 Part B provides information on the Actions of the European Solidarity Corps supported under the strand
“Participation of young people in solidarity activities”.
 Part C provides information about the Actions of the European Solidarity Corps supported under the strand
“Participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities”.
 Part D provides important information concerning quality and support measures offered to participating
organisations and participants during the preparation, implementation and follow-up of activities and projects1
 Part E gives detailed information on procedures for grant application and selection of projects, as well as the
financial and administrative provisions linked to the award of a European Solidarity Corps grant2.
Furthermore, this Guide includes the following Annexes:

SINGLE ENTRY POINT FOR SOLIDARITY ACTIVITIES
The European Union is built on solidarity, a shared value which is strongly felt throughout European society. Solidarity
defines the European project and provides the necessary unity to cope with current and future crises by holding a strong
moral ground. Solidarity provides a clear compass to guide the European youth in their aspirations for a better Union.
Young people need easily accessible opportunities to engage in solidarity activities, which could enable them to express
their commitment to the benefit of communities while acquiring useful experience and competences for their personal,
educational, social, civic and professional development, thereby improving their employability.
The European Solidarity Corps brings together young people to build a more inclusive society, supporting vulnerable people
and responding to societal and humanitarian challenges. It offers an inspiring and empowering experience for young people
who want to help, learn and develop and provides a single entry point for such solidarity activities throughout the Union
and beyond.
It opens up more and better opportunities covering a broad range of areas, such as integration of migrants, environmental
challenges, prevention of natural disasters, education and youth activities, humanitarian aid. It also supports national and
local actors, in their efforts to cope with different societal challenges and crises.
By extending its scope to cover volunteering activities in support of humanitarian aid operations, the European Solidarity
Corps provides needs-based emergency aid and helps to deliver assistance, relief and protection where most needed. It thus
helps addressing not only unmet societal needs in Europe but also humanitarian challenges in third countries.
The activities of the European Solidarity Corps support the objectives of the EU Youth Strategy for 2019-20273 which
encourages young people to become active citizens, agents of solidarity and positive change for communities across Europe,
inspired by EU values and a European identity.
BUILDING ON PAST EXPERIENCE, LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE
The European Solidarity Corps builds on the achievements of more than 25 years of European programmes in the field of
youth and solidarity, especially on the success of the European Voluntary Service, on the EU Aid Volunteers initiative and on
the previous European Solidarity Corps running from 2018 to 2020.

5WHAT IS THE POLICY CONTEXT?
The EU Youth Strategy is the framework for EU youth policy cooperation for 2019-20274 within which it shall make the most
of youth policy's potential. EU youth cooperation aims at tackling existing and upcoming challenges young people are facing
all over Europe and provides a framework of objectives, principles, priorities, core areas and measures for youth policy
cooperation for all relevant stakeholders.
An important aspect of the EU Youth Strategy is the 11 European Youth Goals5, which were developed in the context of the
EU youth dialogue through a participatory approach that involved decision-makers, young people and researchers. These
Youth Goals present a vision for a Europe that enables young people to realise their full potential. They identify cross-
sectoral areas that affect young people’s lives and point out which challenges need to be tackled. Among others, the Youth
Goals call for inclusive societies, space and participation for all and quality employment for all young people. The EU Youth
Strategy should contribute to realising this vision of young people by mobilising EU level policy instruments as well as
actions at national, regional and local level by all stakeholders.
The EU Youth Strategy is built on three core areas of action:
 ENGAGE
 CONNECT
 EMPOWER
Under ENGAGE, the EU Youth Strategy aims for a meaningful civic, economic, social, cultural and political participation of
young people. The Strategy fosters youth participation in democratic life, supports social and civic engagement and aims to
ensure that all young people have the necessary resources to take part in society.
Under CONNECT, the EU Youth Strategy underpins opportunities for young people to experience exchanges, cooperation
and civic action in a European context first hand.
Under EMPOWER, the Strategy aims at supporting youth work in all its forms as catalyst for the empowerment of young
people across Europe.
POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR VOLUNTEERING
Currently, the policy framework is mainly set by the 2008 Council recommendation on the mobility of young volunteers6.
This Recommendation aims to eliminate obstacles to volunteering in Europe by raising awareness, increase the capacity to
offer volunteering opportunities, reduce barriers to participation especially for disadvantaged groups and increase the
recognition of skills gained. It should be, in the course of 2021, replaced by an updated policy guidance.

6Part A – What are the objectives, priorities and important characteristics?
WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES, PRIORITIES AND IMPORTANT
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS?
OBJECTIVES
GENERAL OBJECTIVE
The general objective of the Programme is to enhance the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible and
high-quality solidarity activities, primarily volunteering, as a means to strengthen cohesion, solidarity, democracy, European
identity and active citizenship in the Union and beyond, addressing societal and humanitarian challenges on the ground,
with a particular focus on the promotion of sustainable development, social inclusion and equal opportunities.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
The specific objective of the Programme is to provide young people, including young people with fewer opportunities, with
easily accessible opportunities for engagement in solidarity activities that induce positive societal changes in the Union and
beyond, while improving and properly validating their competences, as well as facilitating their continuous engagement as
active citizens.
PRIORITIES
INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
The European Solidarity Corps aims to promote social inclusion, tolerance, human rights and the value of differences and
diversity of all kinds and to provide all young people equal access to opportunities offered under its Actions.
The Corps provides accessible and flexible formats of activities, additional financial support as well as a range of support
measures (e.g. general and language training, insurance, support before and after solidarity activities, administrative
assistance) to encourage the participation of young people with fewer opportunities and better cater for their specific
needs. When designing their projects and activities, organisations should have an inclusive approach and make use of the
available mechanisms to involve a diverse range of participants.
The European Solidarity Corps should also support projects and activities actively addressing the issue of inclusion and
diversity more broadly in the society.
An Inclusion and Diversity Strategy has been developed to support organisations to better reach out to more participants
with fewer opportunities and help addressing the barriers that different target groups may face.
Young people with fewer opportunities are young people who are at a disadvantage compared to their peers because they
face one or more exclusion factors and obstacles. The list of barriers, spelt out below, is not exhaustive and is meant to
provide a reference in taking action with a view to increasing accessibility and outreach to disadvantaged groups:
 Disabilities: This includes physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which may hinder someone’s full
and effective participation in society on the same footing as others.
 Health problems: Barriers may result from health issues including severe illnesses, chronic diseases, or any other
physical or mental health-related situation that prevents from participating in the programmes.
 Barriers linked to education and training systems: Individuals performing poorly in education and training
systems for various reasons and for early school-leavers, NEETs (people not in education, employment or
training) and low-qualified adults may face barriers. Although other factors may play a role, these educational
difficulties, while they may also be linked to personal circumstances, mostly result from an educational system
which creates structural limitations and/or does not fully take into account the individual’s particular needs.
Individuals can also face barriers to participation when the structure of curricula makes it difficult to undertake a
learning or training mobility abroad as part of their studies.
 Cultural differences: While cultural differences may be perceived as barriers by people from any backgrounds,
they can particularly affect people with fewer opportunities. Such differences may represent significant barriers
to learning in general, all the more for people with a migrant or refugee background – especially newly-arrived
migrants -, people belonging to a national or ethnic minority, sign language users, people with linguistic
adaptation and cultural inclusion difficulties, etc. Being exposed to foreign languages and cultural differences
when taking part in any kind of programme activities may put off individuals and somehow limit the benefits
from their participation. And such cultural differences may even prevent potential participants from applying for
support through the programmes, thereby representing an entry barrier altogether.
7 Social barriers: Social adjustment difficulties such as limited social competences, anti-social or high-risk
behaviours, (ex-)offenders, (ex-)drug or alcohol abusers, or social marginalisation may represent a barrier. Other
social barriers can stem from family circumstances, for instance being the first in the family to access higher
education or being a parent (especially a single parent), a caregiver, a breadwinner or an orphan, or having lived
or currently living in institutional care.
 Economic barriers: Economic disadvantage like a low standard of living, low income, learners who need to work
to support themselves, dependence on the social welfare system, in long-term unemployment, precarious
situations or poverty, being homeless, in debt or with financial problems, etc, may represent a barrier.
 Barriers linked to discrimination: linked to gender, age, ethnicity, religion, beliefs, sexual orientation, disability, or
intersectional factors (a combination of one or several of the mentioned discrimination barriers).
 Geographical barriers: living in remote or rural areas, on small islands or in peripheral/outermost regions, in
urban suburbs, in less serviced areas (limited public transport, poor facilities), etc, may constitute a barrier. Other
difficulties may derive from the limited transferability of services (in particular support to people with fewer
opportunities) that needs to be "mobile" together with the participants when going to a far place or, all the
more, abroad.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION
The European Solidarity Corps can make a meaningful contribution to the Commission’s commitment to tackling climate
and environmental-related challenges. To contribute to the European Green Deal7, the Programme aims at integrating green
practices into all projects and activities as well as promoting environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among
participants and participating organisations. Organisations and participants should thus have an environmental-friendly
approach when designing and implementing their activities.
The Programme also supports projects and activities addressing the topic of environmental protection, sustainability and
climate goals and aiming to protect, conserve and enhance natural capital, to raise awareness about environmental
sustainability and to enable behavioural changes for individual preferences, consumption habits and lifestyles.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
The political guidelines of the European Commission underline the need for Europe to lead the digital transition8. The
European Solidarity Corps can play a role by supporting Europeans, regardless of their gender, age and background to live
and thrive in the digital age through projects and activities that aim to boost digital skills, foster digital literacy and/or
develop an understanding of the risks and opportunities of digital technology.
The European Solidarity Corps also promotes the use of virtual components such as information, communication and
technology tools in all projects and activities.
PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRATIC LIFE
The programme promotes participation of young people in democratic processes and civic engagement. With volunteering
at its heart, the programme engages and empowers young people to be active in society and addresses the Europe-wide
trends of youth limited participation in democratic life and the low levels of knowledge and awareness about European
matters that have an impact on the lives of all European citizens.
The European Solidarity Corps should also strive to strengthen EU identity and raise participants’ awareness of common EU
values, the principles of unity and diversity, as well as social, cultural and historical heritage.
PREVENTION, PROMOTION AND SUPPORT IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH
The European Solidarity Corps can add a significant value to the work ahead of Europe and beyond in addressing the COVID-
19’s impact and recovery, particularly when it comes to prevention, promotion and support in the field of health. It should
play an important role in supporting the health and social care system, under extreme pressure, improving people’s
experience of care, building stronger relationships between services and communities.
The European Solidarity Corps should also aim at mobilising volunteers around other health challenges, such as those
related to cancer, and around health, sport and well-being in general including the promotion of a healthy lifestyle and
physical activity9.

8Part A – What are the objectives, priorities and important characteristics?
IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS
In line with the objectives of the European Solidarity Corps, the following features deserve special attention.
VOLUNTEERING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CORPS
In the context of the European Solidarity Corps, volunteering is a full-time10 unpaid activity that has a duration of up to 12
months and contributes to the achievement of the common good. This type of solidarity activity is undertaken through
participating organisations that offer young people the opportunity to carry out a wide variety of activities, in a structured
way. Volunteering is one of the most visible manifestation of solidarity.
Volunteering also enables young people to acquire useful experience, skills and competences for their personal,
educational, social, cultural, civic and professional development, thereby improving their employability and active
citizenship. Activities supported under volunteering constitute a rich experience in a non-formal and informal learning
context, which enhances young people's competences.
NON-FORMAL AND INFORMAL LEARNING
Non-formal learning refers to learning which takes place outside formal education and training through learning activities
and with some form of learning support. It has a participative and learner-centred approach; it is carried out by learners on
a voluntary basis and is therefore closely linked to young people's needs, aspirations and interests.
Informal learning refers to the learning in daily life activities, at work, with peers, etc. It can often be characterised as
learning by doing. In the youth sector, informal learning has an important role for example in peer group discussions, in
voluntary activities and in a variety of other situations.
Non-formal and informal learning enable young people to acquire essential competences that contribute to their personal
and socio-educational development and foster their active participation in society, thereby - amongst others - improving
their employment prospects. Such learning experiences have also a strong potential to improve the attainment in formal
education and training as well as to address young NEETs (i.e. young people not in employment, education or training) or
young people with fewer opportunities and combat social exclusion.
Learning activities within the youth field are meant to have a significantly positive impact on young people as well as on the
organisations involved, the communities in which these activities take place, the youth field itself and the European
economic and societal sectors at large.
RECOGNITION AND VALIDATION OF LEARNING OUTCOMES
To ensure the impact of European Solidarity Corps activities on the personal, educational, social, civic and professional
development of the participants, the competences that are the learning outcomes of the solidarity activities should be
properly identified and documented.
To that end, the use of effective instruments at Union and national level for the recognition of non-formal and informal
learning, such as Youthpass and Europass should be encouraged, as appropriate. For further information, see part D of this
Guide.
EUROPEAN ADDED VALUE
The European Solidarity Corps shall support solidarity activities which present a clear European added value, for example by
virtue of their:
 transnational character, particularly with regard to learning mobility and cooperation;
 ability to complement other programmes and policies at local, regional, national, Union and international level;
 European dimension with regard to the topics, aims, approaches, expected outcomes and other aspects of these
solidarity activities;
 approach with regard to involving young people from different backgrounds;
 contribution to the effective use of Union transparency and recognition tools.
10 at least 30 and not more than 38 hours per week
9INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION
European Solidarity Corps includes a strong international dimension (i.e. cooperation with partner countries, through
involvement of young people and organisations). Through its extended geographical scope, the Corps contributes to the EU
efforts to support and strengthen capacity and resilience in non-EU countries.
MULTILINGUALISM
Multilingualism is one of the cornerstones of the European project and a powerful symbol of the EU's aspiration to be
united in diversity. Foreign languages have a prominent role among the skills that will help equip people better for the
labour market and make the most of available opportunities. The EU has set the goal that every citizen should have the
opportunity to acquire at least two foreign languages, from an early age.
While the promotion and support of language learning is primarily covered under other EU initiatives, it has been
demonstrated that the lack of language competences is one of the main barriers to European cross-border mobility in
general such as those supported by the European Solidarity Corps. In order to help overcoming this barrier, linguistic
support is provided in the context of the European Solidarity Corps. For further information, see part D of this Guide.
PROTECTION AND SAFETY OF PARTICIPANTS
Protection and safety of participants involved in the activities supported by the European Solidarity Corps are key elements
of the programme. All persons participating in the European Solidarity Corps should have the opportunity to take full
advantage of the possibilities for personal and professional development and learning. This should be assured in a safe
environment which respects and protects the rights of all persons, their physical and emotional integrity, their mental
health and wellbeing.
To this end, each organisation participating in the European Solidarity Corps must have in place effective procedures and
arrangements to promote and guarantee the safety, protection and non-discrimination of the participants in their activity.
Such measures should be adapted based on the needs of the participants. With this regard, all volunteers must be insured
against the risks linked to their participation. A specific insurance policy is foreseen for cross-border volunteers. For further
information, see part D of this Guide.
COMMUNICATING PROJECTS AND THEIR RESULTS TO MAXIMISE IMPACT
Communicating projects and their results (outcomes and outputs) is crucial to ensure impact at different levels. Applicants
are required to plan their communication activities to share information about their project and results during and beyond
the project life cycle.
Beneficiaries must clearly acknowledge the European Union’s support in all communication and dissemination activities and
products, such as events, internet websites and publications. In particular, they must ensure that the European Union em-
blem11 is included in all communication material and they respect the provisions laid out in the grant agreement. The bene-
ficiary’s grant may be reduced if such provisions are not respected.

10Part A – What is supported under the European Solidarity Corps?
WHAT IS SUPPORTED UNDER THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS?
In order to achieve its objectives, the European Solidarity Corps implements four Actions structured into two strands:
 Participation of young people in solidarity activities:
 Volunteering Projects;
 Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas;
 Solidarity Projects.
 Participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities (“Volunteering under the European
Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps”):
 Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects 12.
Additionally, the European Solidarity Corps supports a series of activities and measures aiming at providing high-quality
solidarity activities.
 Quality and Support measures
 networking activities for individuals and organisations participating in the European Solidarity Corps;
 appropriate measures to provide clearance requirements in accordance with applicable national law;
 measures taken before, during or after the solidarity activities that aim to ensure the quality and accessibility
of volunteering, including online and offline training, adapted, where appropriate, to the solidarity activity in
question and its context, language support, insurance, including accident and sickness insurance, the further
use of Youthpass, which identifies and documents the competences acquired by participants during the
solidarity activities, capacity building, and administrative support for participating organisations;
 the development and maintenance of a quality label;
 the activities of European Solidarity Corps Resource Centres to support and raise the quality of the
implementation of the Programme actions and enhance the validation of their outcomes; and
 the establishment, maintenance and updating of an accessible European Solidarity Corps Portal and of other
relevant online services, as well as necessary IT support systems and web-based tools.
12 This Action is planned to be opened in a subsequent call.
11WHAT IS THE BUDGET?
The European Solidarity Corps has an overall indicative financial envelope of EUR 1.009 billion of the EU Budget for the
period 2021-2027. The annual budget is adopted by the Budgetary Authority. The different steps for the adoption of the EU
budget can be followed at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-commission/eu-budget/how-it-works/annual-
lifecycle/preparation_en
For information about the available budget by action, planned number of projects to be granted as well as indicative
average grants, please consult the 2021 European Solidarity Corps Annual Work Programme:
(https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity/organisations/reference-documents-resources_en).
12Part A – Who can participate in the European Solidarity Corps?
WHO IMPLEMENTS THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS?
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
The European Commission is ultimately responsible for the running of the European Solidarity Corps. It manages the budget
and sets priorities, targets and criteria for the initiative on an on-going basis. Furthermore, it guides and monitors the
general implementation, follow-up and evaluation of the initiative at European level. The European Commission also bears
the overall responsibility for the supervision and coordination of the structures in charge of implementing the initiative at
national level.
At European level, the European Commission's Education and Culture Executive Agency (Executive Agency) is responsible
for the implementation of the centralised Actions of the European Solidarity Corps. The Executive Agency is in charge of the
complete life-cycle management of the projects under these Actions, from the promotion, the analysis of the grant
requests, the monitoring of projects on the spot, up to the dissemination of the project and Programme results.
The European Commission, directly or through the Executive Agency, is also responsible for:
 improving the visibility and the systemic impact of the European Solidarity Corps through dissemination and
exploitation of the results;
 managing calls for tenders to provide services within the framework of the Corps.
THE NATIONAL AGENCIES
The European Solidarity Corps is mainly implemented through Indirect Management, meaning that the European
Commission entrusts budget implementation tasks to National Agencies; the rationale of this approach is to bring the
European Solidarity Corps as close as possible to its beneficiaries and to adapt to the diversity of each country. For this
purpose, one or more National Agencies is appointed in each programme country. These National Agencies promote and
implement the European Solidarity Corps at national level and act as the link between the European Commission and
participating organisations at local, regional and national level. It is their task to:
 provide appropriate information on the European Solidarity Corps;
 administer a fair and transparent selection process for project applications to be funded in their country;
 monitor and evaluate the implementation of the European Solidarity Corps in their country;
 provide support to project applicants and participating organisations throughout the project life-cycle;
 collaborate effectively with the network of all National Agencies and the European Commission;
 ensure the visibility of the Corps;
 promote the dissemination and exploitation of the results at local and national level.
In addition, National Agencies play an important role as intermediate structures for the qualitative development and
implementation of the European Solidarity Corps by:
 carrying out the Training and Evaluation Cycle in programme countries;
 carrying out projects and activities such as networking Activities - outside the tasks of project life-cycle
management - that support the qualitative implementation of the European Solidarity Corps and/or trigger policy
developments;
 contributing to the links and synergies between the European Solidarity Corps and the Union youth policy;
 providing a supportive approach to newcomers and less advantaged target groups in order to remove the
obstacles to full participation;
 seeking cooperation with external bodies and National Authorities in order to increase the impact of the
European Solidarity Corps in their country and in the European Union.
The supportive approach of National Agencies aims at guiding the users through all phases, from the first contact with the
European Solidarity Corps through the application process to the realisation of the project and the final evaluation. This
principle is not in contradiction with the fairness and the transparency of selection procedures. Rather, it is based on the
idea that in order to guarantee equal opportunities for everybody, it is necessary to give more assistance to some target
groups through advising, counselling, monitoring and coaching systems tailored to their needs.
13WHAT OTHER BODIES ARE INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN
SOLIDARITY CORPS?
Apart from the European Commission, the Executive Agency and the National Agencies, the following bodies provide
complementary expertise to the implementation of the Corps:
RESOURCE CENTRES
The Resource Centres are part of the quality and support measures mentioned in the legal base establishing the European
Solidarity Corps. They constitute additional entrusted tasks to be performed by designated National Agencies to support the
development, implementation and quality of Actions under the European Solidarity Corps. The European Solidarity Corps
will benefit from the already well-established network of Resources Centres under the Erasmus programme. In addition, a
dedicated European Solidarity Corps Resource Centre was set up.
SALTO-YOUTH RESOURCE CENTRES
SALTO13-YOUTH Resource Centres are structures mainly supported through the Erasmus programme aiming to improve the
quality of projects in the field of youth. Through their thematic (participation, information, inclusion, diversity, training and
recognition) or geographical (Eastern Partnership countries and Russia, Southern Mediterranean, Western Balkans) focus,
they provide resources, information and training in specific areas for National Agencies and other actors involved in the

14Part A – Who can participate in the European Solidarity Corps?
WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS?
Young people constitute the target population of the European Solidarity Corps. With the exception of Solidarity Projects
where young people can apply directly, the Corps mainly involves young people through organisations, institutions, public or
private bodies that organise solidarity activities. The conditions of access to the Corps therefore relate to these two actors:
the "participants" (young people participating in the Corps) and the "organisations". For both participants and participating
organisations, the conditions for participation depend on the country in which they are legally based and on the Action
concerned. These conditions are specified in Part B and C of this Guide, under each specific Action.
PARTICIPANTS
Young people express their willingness to participate in the European Solidarity Corps by registering on the European
Solidarity Corps Portal. The registration at the European Solidarity Corps Portal is possible as of 17 years of age but
participants must have reached 18 and must not be older than 30 at the start date of the activity. For participants in
humanitarian aid related solidarity activities, the upper age limit at the start of the activity is 35 years old.
European Solidarity Corps projects are mainly submitted and managed by organisations. Organisations participating in
European Solidarity Corps projects must be established in a programme country or a partner country.
ELIGIBLE COUNTRIES14
Members States of the European Union and third countries associated to the Programme can fully take part in all the
Actions of the European Solidarity Corps (Programme Countries). In addition, some Actions are open for participation of
other countries (Partner Countries). Please refer to the Actions in Part B and Part C of this Guide for the specific conditions.
Under the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, volunteering activities may only take place in those regions of third
countries where humanitarian aid activities and operations take place and where there are no ongoing international or non-
international armed conflicts. A list of eligible safe countries of destination will be published under each specific call.

17WHICH ACTIONS ARE SUPPORTED?
The following Actions may be supported and covered in this section:
 Volunteering Projects;
 Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas;
 Solidarity Projects.
This section also covers all relevant information and criteria for the Quality Label, pre-requisite to participate in Volunteering
Projects and Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas.
In line with the general and specific objectives of the European Solidarity Corps, the above actions supported by the
Programme are expected to bring positive and long-lasting effects on the participants and participating organisations
involved, as well as on the communities in which these actions take place.
As regards participants, the solidarity activities, as well as any other supported activities related to them (e.g. quality and
support measures), are meant to produce the following main outcomes:
 improved skills and competences for personal, educational, social, civic, cultural and professional development;
 more active participation in democratic life and in society in general;
 enhanced employability and transition into the labour market;
 increased sense of initiative and entrepreneurship;
 increased self-empowerment and self-esteem;
 improved foreign language competences;
 enhanced intercultural awareness;
 better awareness of the European project and the EU common values;
 increased motivation for further engagement in solidarity activities.
Supported solidarity activities are also expected to produce the following outcomes on participating organisations:
 increased capacity to operate at EU/international level;
 innovative and improved way of operating towards their target groups;
 greater understanding and responsiveness to diversity (social, linguistic, cultural, gender and ethnic diversity,
diverse abilities etc.);
 more modern, dynamic, committed and professional environment inside the organisations.
As regards communities where the activities related to supported solidarity activities are implemented, the following
outcomes are expected:
 increased ability to address societal challenges;
 greater understanding and responsiveness to diversity (social, linguistic, cultural, gender and ethnic diversity,
diverse abilities etc.);
In the long run, the combined effect of supported solidarity activities is expected to have a positive impact on a large
number of stakeholders in programme and partner countries.
18Part B – Volunteering Projects
VOLUNTEERING PROJECTS
WHAT ARE VOLUNTEERING PROJECTS?
Volunteering projects offer opportunities for young people to take part in solidarity activities and help to address identified
needs within local communities and contribute to overcoming important societal challenges on the ground. Volunteering
may take place in a country other than the country of residence of the participant (cross-border) or in the country of
residence of the participant (in-country).
The scope of volunteering projects is broad, covering a wide range of areas, such as environmental protection, climate
change mitigation or greater social inclusion.
WHICH ACTIVITIES CAN BE SUPPORTED UNDER THIS ACTION?
The following activities are supported.
INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTEERING
Individual Volunteering is a solidarity activity of a duration of 2 to 12 months. This type of solidarity activity provides young
people with the opportunity to contribute to the daily work of organisations in solidarity activities to the ultimate benefit of
the communities within which the activities are carried out.
In duly justified cases, especially to encourage the participation of young people with fewer opportunities, volunteering
activities of 2 weeks – 2 months can be accepted and implemented.
Individual volunteering activities can take place:
 Cross-border i.e. activities taking place in a country different from the country of residence of the participant(s);
or
 In-country, i.e. activities taking place in the same country as the country of residence of the participant, in
particular, to encourage and facilitate the participation of young people with fewer opportunities.
In-country activities should present a clear European added value including complementarity
to existing national schemes. Projects with in-country activities presenting a weak or a lack of
European added value will not be considered as relevant in the context of the Corps.
VOLUNTEERING TEAMS
Volunteering teams are solidarity activities that allow teams of participants coming from at least two different countries to
volunteer together for a period between 2 weeks and 2 months. Such solidarity activities could especially contribute to the
inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities in the European Solidarity Corps. The composition of the volunteering
teams must be international; at least a quarter of the volunteers must come from a country other than the one where the
activity takes place. In volunteering teams, European Solidarity Corps’ volunteers will carry out tasks for a project over a
short period of time (usually, but not exclusively, during holidays, breaks between study periods, transition from education
to work, etc.). Despite their shorter duration, these activities will be valuable both for the individuals and for the
communities in which the volunteering takes place.
Examples of the valuable work that can be accomplished even over a short period of time include: e.g. restoring cultural
heritage damaged by natural disaster, catering for species threatened by extinction; organising educational activities in
refugee camps, etc.
The advantages of this specific type of group activities compared to standard individual volunteering activities include the
following:
 Volunteers will carry out the activity in a group. This can be an incentive for youngsters who do not feel ready to
embark into challenging experiences on their own. The activity will also be shorter in its duration. This can foster
the participation of those youngsters who cannot commit for a long period of time because of their studies or
jobs, but still want to be of help for the community;
 The above makes volunteering teams particularly suitable for a first experience in volunteering. They can thus
serve as an entry-way for long-term activities or provide an incentive to start an own solidarity project.
19Furthermore, the following additional type of activity can also be funded:
 Preparatory visits to the venue of the volunteering activities before the start of the activities. The purpose of the
preparatory visits is to ensure high quality activities by facilitating and preparing administrative arrangements,
building trust and understanding and setting-up a solid partnership between the organisations and the people
involved. The visits will be organised for activities involving young people with fewer opportunities or when the
visit is necessary for the implementation of an activity with a strong inclusion dimension. Participants with fewer
opportunities that will take part in the planned activities can be involved in the visit, in order to help with their
preparation and involve them in activity design so that their needs are taken into account from the start.
HOW TO SET UP A PROJECT ?
A Volunteering Project consists of four stages: planning, preparation, implementation and follow-up. Participating
organisations and young people involved in the activities should take an active role in all those stages enhancing thus their
learning experience.
 Planning (including defining the learning outcomes, activity formats, development of work programme, schedule
of activities)
 Preparation phase, including practical arrangements, selection of participants, set up of agreements with
partners and participants, tailor-made linguistic/intercultural/task-related preparation based on the needs of
participants before departure;
 Implementation of activities;
 Follow-up phase, including the evaluation of the activities, issue of the certificate of participation, support to
participants upon return as well as the evaluation, dissemination and use of the activities’ outcomes.
Most European Solidarity Corps activities are implemented by one or several organisations. All organisations involved in a
volunteering activity must hold a valid Quality Label or Erasmus+ volunteering accreditation. The organisations involved
assume the roles of “supporting” the implementation of the activities and the volunteers and/or “hosting” the volunteers:
 The host role covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant, including the
development of a programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the
participant during all the phases as appropriate (some of these activities can be carried out by a support
organisation involved in the same project).
 The support role entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, a mediation
between them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their
activity as well as project management and coordination.
Where only one organisation is involved, the organisation has to ensure that all phases are carried out and the above tasks
and responsibilities are fulfilled. In all cases, the involvement of a support organisation in activities involving young people
with fewer opportunities is highly recommended.
In addition, organisations applying for grant must hold a valid Quality Label for lead organisations. For more information on
the Quality Label, please refer to the relevant section of this Guide.
SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS
Young people who want to participate in the European Solidarity Corps must register on the European Solidarity Corps
Portal. Young people with fewer opportunities may receive support from organisations to complete the registration phase.
The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers a place for those young people and organisations holding a Quality Label and
willing to implement solidarity activities to find each other. Organisations have to select the participants from the database
of registered young people.
QUALITY AND SUPPORT MEASURES
A set of measures and services, such as training, language learning support, identification and documentation of the
competences acquired, insurance are foreseen to ensure the quality of the volunteering activities and a strong learning
dimension for the participants. Some of these measures are optional and could be used depending on the interest and
needs of the participants and some of them are compulsory. Organisations should aim to promote the use of the the
General Online Training as part of the volunteers’ learning experience. Detailed information on those measures is available
in Part D of this Guide.
20Part B – Volunteering Projects
INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
The European Solidarity Corps seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness. Organisations
should design accessible and inclusive activities, taking into account the views and needs of participants with fewer
opportunities.
To support inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities, additional support measures and
funding that allow participating organisations to better accommodate and cater for the needs of young people
with fewer opportunities are available.
In order to benefit from additional funding applicants will be required to describe how they involve
young people who are at comparative disadvantage i.e they have comparatively fewer opportunities
than their peers in the same country/area/age group/situation, what are the specific needs to
ensure their participation on equal terms as others and what specific measures they plan to put in
place to cater for these needs.
In this sense, “involving” does not refer to a target group the organisations work with. It means to
facilitate the participation of young people with fewer opportunities by designing the measures of
outreach and support as well as the project activities in an inclusive and accessible way.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION
Volunteering activities should promote environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among participants, raising
the awareness about the importance of acting to reduce or compensate for the environmental footprint of activities.
Volunteering activities should be designed and implemented with environmental consciousness by e.g. integrating
sustainable practices such as reducing waste and recycling, using sustainable means of transportation.
DIGITAL TRANSITION
Participating organisations are encouraged to make use of digital tools and learning methods to complement their physical
activities, to improve the cooperation between partner organisations, and the quality of the activities.

29 Exceptionally, international organisations must apply to the National Agency which awarded their Quality Label for lead organisation.
282 9VOLUNTEERING TEAMS IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS
WHAT ARE VOLUNTEERING TEAMS IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS?
Volunteering Teams in high priority areas are large scale, high impact projects supporting voluntary activities carried out by
young people from at least two different countries coming together to express solidarity by implementing short-term
interventions that address common European challenges in policy areas defined each year at EU level.
WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES?
This year’s priority is focused on COVID-19 impact and recovery, particularly through supporting the health and social care
systems with activities tackling prevention, promotion and support in the field of health; addressing major health challenges
(i.e. life-threatening illnesses like cancer) and promoting health, healthy lifestyle, physical activity and well-being overall.
For the purpose of this call, applications for funding could:
 contribute to the improvement of health and well-being of vulnerable people, including persons affected by
chronic or life-threatening diseases (e.g. cancer);
 contribute to building inclusive societies through protecting vulnerable groups as people with drug-alcohol
dependence, elderly and children, migrants, homeless etc. from COVID-19 impact and other diseases.
Additionally, to increase the quality and impact of the action, projects would integrate complementary activities to:
 foster European cooperation to strengthen the capacity of the solidarity sector to tackle common European
challenges, such as health crisis, protection of vulnerable groups through networking and exchanging
experiences;
 raise awareness about prevention through campaigns, promotion and information dissemination, public
discussions in order to improve the general health of European populations.
WHICH ACTIVITIES CAN BE SUPPORTED?
The following activities are supported:
Volunteering Teams
Volunteering Teams are solidarity activities that allow groups of minimum 5 participants to volunteer together for a period
between 2 weeks and 2 months. Composition of the team should be international (including participants from at least two
different countries) with at least a quarter of team members coming from countries that are different from the country
where the activity takes place. In volunteering teams, European Solidarity Corps’ volunteers carry out tasks for a project
over a short period of time (usually, but not exclusively, during holidays, breaks between study periods, transition from
education to work, etc.).
Examples of the valuable work that can be accomplished by volunteering teams under this Action include: organising
information campaigns, providing critical community services to most vulnerable populations e.g. arranging grocery
shopping for elderly, organizing recreational activities for children with cancer, intergenerational workshops on use of online
tools for socialising and communicating, supporting vaccination campaigns.
In Volunteering Teams, volunteers will carry out the activity in a group. This can be an incentive for
youngsters who do not feel ready to embark into challenging experiences on their own; The activity will be
shorter in its duration. This can foster the participation of those youngsters who cannot commit for a long
period of time because of their studies or jobs, but still want to be of help for the community.
The above makes also Volunteering Teams an inclusive format, particularly suitable for a first experience in
volunteering and the participation of young people with fewer opportunities. They can thus serve as an
entry-way for long-term activities or even provide an incentive to start an own solidarity project.
30Part B – Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas
Complementary activities
Complementary activities are relevant side activities designed to add value and augment the results of the project as well as
to strengthen its impact on the local, regional, and/or European level. These complementary activities aim at raising
awareness of the value of volunteering for young people and for communities as well as at strengthening the recognition of
the skills and competences gained by the volunteers. These activities could also enhance the capacity of the solidarity sector
organisations to tackle common European challenges and their abilities to develop volunteering projects.
Complementary activities could include workshops, conferences, seminars, training courses, job shadowing, coaching,
exchange of good practices etc.
Preparatory Visit
Preparatory visits are visits to the venue of the volunteering activities before they start. They should ensure high quality of
activities involving young people with fewer opportunities or when the visit is necessary for the implementation of an
activity with a strong inclusion dimension. The visit can focus on facilitating and preparing administrative arrangements,
building trust and understanding and setting-up a solid partnership between the organisations and the people involved.
Participants with fewer opportunities that will take part in the planned activities can be involved in the visit, in order to help
with their preparation and involve them in activity design so that their needs are taken into account from the start.
HOW TO SET UP A PROJECT?
A project is implemented by at least three organisations from at least two different eligible countries and will typically
consist of the following stages:
 Planning (defining the needs, objectives, development of work programme, schedule of activities etc.);
 Preparation (practical arrangements, selection of participants, set up of agreements with partners and
participants, linguistic/intercultural/task-related preparation of participants before departure);
 Implementation of activities (including support and guidance to participants during the activities);
 Follow-up (the evaluation of the activities, follow-up of participants, issue of the certificate of participation as
well as the dissemination and use of the project's outcomes).
Implementation of cross-border solidarity activities for groups of volunteers are the core of a project. A project must thus
include at least one volunteering team activity.
A project should also include complementary activities. Furthermore, organisations are encouraged to organise preparatory
visits to ensure high quality of activities involving young people with fewer opportunities.
Eligibility criteria laid down below must be respected.
SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS
Young people who want to participate in the European Solidarity Corps must register on the European Solidarity Corps
Portal. Young people with fewer opportunities may receive support from organisations to complete the registration phase.
The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers a place for those young people and organisations holding a Quality Label and
willing to implement solidarity activities to find each other. Organisations have to select the participants from the database
of registered young people.
QUALITY AND SUPPORT MEASURES
A set of measures and services, such as training, language learning support, identification and documentation of the
competences acquired, insurance are foreseen to ensure the quality of the volunteering activities and a strong learning
dimension for the participants. Some of these measures are optional and could be used depending on the interest and
needs of the participants, and some of them are compulsory. Organisations should aim to promote the use of the General
Online Training as part of the volunteers’ learning experience. Detailed information on those measures is available in Part D
of this Guide.
INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
The European Solidarity Corps seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness. Organisations
should design accessible and inclusive activities, taking into account the views and needs of participants with fewer
opportunities.
3 1To support inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities, additional support measures and
funding that allow participating organisations to better accommodate and cater for the needs of young people
with fewer opportunities are available.
In order to benefit from additional funding applicants will be required to describe how they involve
young people who are at comparative disadvantage i.e they have comparatively fewer opportunities
than their peers in the same country/area/age group/situation, what are the specific needs to
ensure their participation on equal terms as others and what specific measures they plan to put in
place to cater for these needs.
 In this sense, “involving” does not refer to a target group the organisations work with. It means to
facilitate the participation of young people with fewer opportunities by designing the measures of
outreach and support as well as the project activities in an inclusive and accessible way.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION
Volunteering activities should promote environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among participants, raising
the awareness about the importance of acting to reduce or compensate for the environmental footprint of activities.
Volunteering activities should be designed and implemented with environmental consciousness by e.g. integrating
sustainable practices such as reducing waste and recycling, using sustainable means of transportation.
DIGITAL TRANSITION
Participating organisations are encouraged to make use of digital tools and learning methods to complement their physical
activities, to improve the cooperation between partner organisations, and the quality of the activities.
WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA USED TO ASSESS PROJECTS?
The projects are selected and managed at EU level, by the Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA). The centralised
approach ensures the underlying pan-European dimension of these projects and enables large projects with increased
number of participants and high impact.

3 5QUALITY LABEL
WHAT IS THE QUALITY LABEL?
The Quality Label is a process that certifies that an organisation is able and willing to carry out high quality solidarity
activities in compliance with the principles, objectives and quality standards of the European Solidarity Corps. Obtaining a
Quality Label is a precondition for participation in Volunteering activities.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUALITY LABEL
There are two main types of Quality Label, depending on the role(s) that the organisation wishes to play in the process:
 Host role - covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant, including the
development of a programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the
participant during all the phases as appropriate
 Support role - entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, a mediation between
them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity
All organisations who are awarded a Quality Label will be able to publish their opportunities in the European Solidarity
Corps Portal and also to join other organisations in developing and providing opportunities for young people.
NB: In addition to these roles, those organisations who wish to apply for grants, manage and
coordinate volunteering activities under Volunteering Projects will be required to obtain a Quality
Label for lead organisation. Organisations who do not hold a Quality Label for lead organisation
may act as partners in projects. Further information on the lead organisations is available in the
relevant section of this Guide.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
The requirements to obtain the Quality Label vary depending on the type of Quality Label requested.
The Quality Label is awarded following a fair and transparent selection process, involving three main stages: submission of
Quality Label application, assessment and award.
The applications for the Quality Label can be submitted on a continuous basis (i.e. at any time) during the programming
period. The organisations will submit application forms for one or for both roles, filling in parts which are relevant for the
Quality Label roles they wish to play.
Applications will be assessed against eligibility criteria, award criteria as well as exclusion criteria (for more information on
this last criterion, see Part E of this Guide).
The Quality Label is awarded for the entire duration of the programming period, subject to continued compliance with
requirements. The Quality Label remains valid until the end of the last activity in which the organisation is involved as
partner, implemented through a grant of the current programming period. The National Agencies will monitor compliance
and may carry out periodical reassessments.
In order to facilitate partner-finding, profiles of all organisations holding a Quality Label are published in a database38 of
Quality Label organisations.
Once awarded a Quality Label, organisations have access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal where they are invited to
advertise activities for which they are looking for participants. Organisations have to make use of the European Solidarity
Corps Portal's database to search for potential participants. Information in the database is published as it is formulated in
the Quality Label application form.
38 https://europa.eu/youth/volunteering/organisations_en
36Part B – Quality Label
TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS FOR ORGANISATIONS HOLDING AN ERASMUS+ (EUROPEAN
VOLUNTARY SERVICE) ACCREDITATION OR A QUALITY LABEL AWARDED UNDER THE PREVIOUS
PROGRAMMES
The following provisions have been put in place for organisations who have been awarded a Quality Label or Erasmus+
accreditation under the previous programmes and that wish to continue to participate in the Programme.
 Organisations who are holders of a Quality Label for volunteering
These organisations will have their Quality Label validity extended for the same role, until 31 December 2027. In specific
cases the NAs may ask some Quality Label holders to submit new applications, under the new programme. If these
organisations wish to change role or add another role, they will be required to submit a new application for Quality Label.
Those that intend to keep the same role but also wish to act as lead organisation under Volunteering Projects in the new
programme will be required to fill in the lead organisation section in the application form.
 Organisations who are holders of Erasmus+ volunteering accreditations
These organisations will be able to use their accreditation to take part in activities for the same role until 31 December
2021. They are required to apply for a Quality Label if they want to participate as lead organisation under Volunteering
Projects in the new programme. In such cases, organisations will be required to submit a new application for Quality Label.
PRE-DEFINED ACTIVITIES AND LOCATIONS
An organisation applying for the Quality Label with a host role must declare pre-defined activities, i.e. standard activities in
which volunteers are involved, with a set of tasks that they will carry out in the organisation.
Organisations applying for a host role may also declare locations during the application for a Quality Label. A location is a
placein which the activities are organised for a specific number of volunteers. A location is not required to have legal
personality. By default, the main address of the host organisation is considered as a first location but organisations can
declare and host volunteers in more than one location. Organisations can organise an activity for volunteers that are hosted
in different locations, provided that the hosting capacity in terms of number of volunteers is not exceeded. The locations’
appropriateness to accommodate volunteering activities should be demonstrated in the Quality Label application. The
awarding bodies will assess all declared locations against the award criteria. All locations must be in the same country where
the organisation is based.
The pre-defined activities that the volunteers will be involved in, in terms of tasks to be performed, must also be defined for
each location.
WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES AND QUALITY STANDARDS?
The European Solidarity Corps guarantees high-quality volunteering activities, through the Quality Label process. The
activities are based on a common understanding of key principles and standards, including:
 Equal opportunities and non-discrimination. Volunteers are to be selected in a fair, transparent and objective
way, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion or disability. No previous
qualifications, educational level, specific experience or language knowledge must be required. A more specific
profile of the volunteer might be drawn up if justified by the nature of the tasks of the activity or by the project
context. In order to promote inclusion, participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the
volunteer, with the exception of possible contributions to travel costs (if the grant does not fully cover these
costs). The activities should respect the principles set out in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities.
 Avoidance of job substitution. Volunteering activities must not substitute traineeships or jobs, so that any
adverse effect on potential or existing paid employment is avoided. The involvement of volunteers should
complement the work of paid staff. They should not replace paid staff or undercut their pay and conditions of
service.
 Avoidance of harmful activities. Security and safety of the participants, participating organisations and target
groups must be ensured. Such security and safety should include appropriate clearance requirements for
participants working with vulnerable groups in accordance with applicable national law. Volunteering activities
should be implemented with due consideration for the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as
environmental crises, conflicts or pandemics. The activities should respect the principles set out in the EU
Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child39.
39 https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/eu_guidelines_rights_of_child_0.pdf
3 7 Provision of high quality, easily accessible and inclusive activities. The volunteering tasks should enable
participants to develop skills and competencies for personal, social and civic development. Organisations should
embed the activities of volunteers within the local context and to facilitate volunteers’ interaction with the local
community and civil society. The value and benefits of European Solidarity Corps volunteering should be
recognised for volunteers, through validation of learning outcomes.
 Adequate training, working and volunteering arrangements. Safe and decent living and working conditions must
be ensured for participants. The young people and the organisations must sign a volunteering agreement that
will outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and will include a well-defined set of volunteering tasks.
 “No profit”. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, beneficiaries must not derive any profit from the
activities funded by the grants awarded (see part E of this Programme Guide for further details). Furthermore,
organisations should cover the participants’ expenditure arising from participation in such solidarity activities but
should not provide them with salaries or an economic benefit.
In addition to complying with the above-mentioned principles, organisations implementing volunteering activities must
carry out the following set of tasks and responsibilities.
When applying for a Quality Label, organisations must be able to demonstrate their capacity to perform the tasks and
responsibilities relevant to the role they are applying for.

3 9WHAT IS THE QUALITY LABEL FOR LEAD ORGANISATIONS?
Obtaining a Quality Label for lead organisations is a precondition for applying for funds to implement Volunteering Projects.
Those who request lead role will be required to fill in an additional module in the application form and answer
supplementary questions. Lead organisations will be required to lay down their longer-term objectives and activity plan,
expected benefits as well as their approach to project management. Applications for a Quality Label for lead organisations
will be assessed against selection criteria. The relevant section in application form will also be assessed against a
supplementary set of award criteria.
Awarding of the Quality Label for lead organisations confirms that the applicant has appropriate and effective processes
and measures in place to coordinate and implement high quality solidarity activities as planned. Previous experience in the
European Solidarity Corps or Erasmus+ (2014-2020) is not a requirement for participation.
The award of a Quality Label for lead organisations depends on being successful in the application for a Quality Label for
host and/or support role (partner organisations). Organisations who are holders of a Quality Label will have the possibility to
apply for Quality Label for lead organisations at any time during the programming period.
Successful applicants for such a Quality Label type will gain access to funding opportunities for the duration of their Quality
Label, subject to funding availability and performance assessments. They will sign an agreement with the National Agency
awarding the Quality Label.
The National Agencies will determine the duration of the Quality Labels awarded to lead organisations, with a minimum of
three years.

WHAT ARE THE MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE MEASURES?
CHANGING/UPDATING THE QUALITY LABEL
The organisations holding a Quality Label must notify the awarding body of any changes in their organisation that should be
reflected in their Quality Label. The awarding body can reassess whether that organisation continues to comply with the
conditions that led to the attribution of the Quality Label.
MONITORING AND CHECKS
The Quality Label will be periodically reassessed. The bodies in charge of the Quality Label may carry out regular or ad hoc
monitoring visits to verify that the organisations holding a Quality Label still meet the quality standards.
REMEDIAL MEASURES
In case of new lead applicants, high risk organisations, failure to comply with National Agency’s instructions and deadlines,
very low performance resulting from reporting, monitoring and quality assurance checks, or violations of the rules of the
Programme (including in another action), the National Agency may take the following remedial measures:
42Part B – Quality Label
 Observation: The National Agency may limit the level of funding that an organisation holding a Quality Label for
lead organisations can apply for. Organisations who received the Quality Label for the first time may be put
under observation if risk of low quality implementation is identified during the operational capacity check.
Suspension: in the case of applicant organisations, suspended organisations are no longer able to apply for funding. The
National Agency may also terminate some or all ongoing grant agreements awarded under the Quality Label of an applicant
organisation. If suspended, partner organisations will no longer be able to participate in the programme until it has taken
measures and improved performance. The observation or suspension period will continue until the National Agency
determines that the conditions and quality requirements set in this Call are once again fulfilled, and that the risk of low
performance has been addressed by the organisation.
Organisations under suspension or observation may not apply for a new Quality Label.
TERMINATION
In cases of serious underperformance, failure to comply with National Agency’s instructions and deadlines or repeated
violations of the Programme rules, the Quality Label can be withdrawn. The National Agency will give due consideration to
each case of non-compliance and will prompt the organisation well in advance to allow enough time to take corrective
measures.
In addition, the National Agencies may terminate a Quality Label if the organisation ceases to exist or, in the case of lead
organisations, following a period of at least three years in which no grant requests have been made.
4 3SOLIDARITY PROJECTS
WHAT IS A SOLIDARITY PROJECT?
A Solidarity Project is a non-profit solidarity activity initiated, developed and implemented by young people themselves for
a period from 2 to 12 months. It gives a group of minimum five young persons the chance to express solidarity by taking
responsibility and committing themselves to bring positive change in their local community. The project should have a
clearly identified topic which the group of young people wish to explore together and which has to be translated into the
concrete daily activities of the project and involve all the members of the group. Solidarity Projects should address key
challenges within the communities, where relevant including those identified jointly in the border regions and it should also
present European added value. Participation in a solidarity project is an important non-formal learning experience through
which young people can boost their personal, educational, social and civic development.
A solidarity project will typically consist of the following stages:
 Planning;
 Preparation;
 Implementation of the activities;
 Follow-up (including the evaluation of the activities as well as the sharing of project's results).
WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES AND IMPACT?
A Solidarity Project should clearly refer to the European Solidarity Corps' objectives and principles in particular towards
solidarity. This common value provides the necessary unity to cope with current and future societal challenges, which young
Europeans are willing to help address by expressing their solidarity in practice. A Solidarity Project could address young
people facing situations that make their inclusion in society more difficult. A solidarity project should also consider
sustainable and environmental-friendly practices in the planned activities.
The young people should take the initiative to respond to the issues and challenges around them, which is why a solidarity
project should be directly linked to the local community they live in, although some of them can also tackle regional or even
national issues. Some solidarity projects could also tackle common challenges identified jointly in the border regions. A
Solidarity Project should have an impact on the local community by addressing local issues, targeting a specific group or
developing local opportunities (particularly in communities located in rural, isolated,marginalised or corss-border areas) but
also through involving different actors and developing new partnerships. Thus, by setting common goals and cooperating
together to achieve them, communities can benefit from a solidarity project.
Together with addressing the local challenges, a solidarity project should also demonstrate European added value by
addressing priorities identified at European level. A solidarity project should reflect a common concern for topics within the
European society, such as for example integrating third-country nationals, climate change or active democratic participation.
The European added value can be expressed through any element of a solidarity project that is linked with European issues,
values and priorities. The European priorities will also be promoted through sharing of the results of the project.
Participation in a Solidarity Project will also be an important non-formal learning experience for young people. It should
foster sense of initiative, active European citizenship and entrepreneurial spirit. In particular, young people managing the
project could absorb in practice the concept of social entrepreneurship by creating new products or services that benefit
local community or society in general and address important societal challenges. By putting their own ideas into practice,
meeting unexpected situations and finding solutions for them, trying out innovative and creative measures, young people
will learn new skills and develop their capacities, express their own creativity and take responsibility for their action. They
will boost their self-esteem, autonomy and motivation to learn. Participation in managing and implementing a solidarity
project could be also a first step into self-employment or setting up organisations in the solidarity, non-profit or youth
sectors.
44Part B – Solidarity Projects
HOW TO SET UP A SOLIDARITY PROJECT?
Young people who want to form a group to run a solidarity project must be registered in the European Solidarity Corps
portal. There is no maximum number of the group’s members. The activities will take place in the country of residence of
the applicant, facilitating in particular the participation of young people who may encounter difficulties to engage in
transnational activities.
The group will decide autonomously on the working methods and how the project will be managed. One of the group’s
members will assume a role of legal representative who will submit the application (unless an organisation applies on behalf
of the group). The group will arrange the distribution of tasks and responsibilities, ensure efficient coordination and
communication between its members and define the amount of time spent in carrying out the tasks in relation to the goals
of the project. Working methods should aim to involve all members of the group through various phases of the project and
of activities (preparation, implementation and sharing the results). The phases should be clearly structured with the help of
a project’s timetable.
A group of young people who plan a solidarity project can seek for support from an organisation (any public or private
body). An organisation may apply on their behalf for a grant under the European Solidarity Corps. The role of the
organisation should be mainly administrative, to support the group in the project life-cycle administrative and financial
tasks. However, it can also offer support and guidance in identifying and documenting learning outcomes.
Young people carrying out a Solidarity Project may be supported by coaches. A coach is a resource person who could have
youth work experience to accompany groups of young people and support their participation through different phases of
the project. The coach will remain outside the Solidarity Project, so he/she will not be a member of the group. The coach
empowers the group of young people in those areas and topics they need support in, in order to successfully implement the
project by themselves and can play different roles based on the needs of the group. This could be done through regular
coaching sessions throughout the project period, punctual trainings on specific topics or a combination of both. The coach
can provide advice on having quality learning process and assist in identifying and documenting learning outcomes at the
end of the project. The group of young people can use the support of one or several coaches depending on their needs. As a
principle, the coach works with the applying group of young people, not with the target group(s) of the project.
For example a coach could be a person to turn to with doubts, questions, conflicts in the group; a trainer to give a workshop
on project management; to teach the group certain skills needed for the project; a person supporting and monitoring the
learning process.
Through the different phases of the project, the group should reflect on the learning process, which they experience and
have experienced. During the planning phase of the project, the learning goals should be discussed together with the
general aims of the project. During the implementation, regular reflection is encouraged and towards the end of the project,
the group should consider measures that make the learning outcomes visible. For recognising and validating these learning
outcomes it is recommended to use Youthpass and the related learning process reflection.
The group should reflect together on measures aimed at the visibility of their project and the visibility of the European
Solidarity Corps in general. The group should also reflect on follow-up measures. This means that the project should be
framed within a longer-term perspective and planned with a view to have effects after it ends. In order to make the project
and its results more sustainable, the group is expected to carry out a final evaluation. This should make possible to assess
whether the objectives of the project have been achieved; the expectations of the group have been met and evaluate the
overall success. The group should consider the ways of sharing the results of the project and reflect on with who they
should be shared.
INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
The European Solidarity Corps seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness. Young people
implementing Solidarity Projects should design accessible and inclusive activities, taking into account the needs of
participants with fewer opportunities.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION
Solidarity Projects should promote environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among participants, raising the
awareness about the importance of acting to reduce or compensate for the environmental footprint of activities. Solidarity
Projects should be designed and implemented with environmental consciousness by e.g. integrating sustainable practices
such as reducing waste and recycling, using sustainable means of transportation.
DIGITAL TRANSITION
The European Solidarity Corps supports incorporating the use of digital tools and learning methods in Solidarity Projects.

ART ARTICIPATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN
HUMANITARIAN AID RELATED SOLIDARITY ACTIVITIES
“VOLUNTEERING UNDER THE EUROPEAN VOLUNTARY HUMANITARIAN AID CORPS”
In this part, readers will find relevant information and criteria for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering, pre-
requisite for organisations to participate in Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects:
 a description of the Quality Label;
 tables presenting the criteria which are used to assess proposals;
 additional information on quality features of activities.
Before submitting an application, applicants are advised to read carefully the entire section concerning the Action under
which they wish to apply.
50Part D – Quality and support measures
WHICH ACTIONS ARE SUPPORTED?
Under this strand, the European Soldiarity Corps supports volunteering in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities.
Given the significant increase in global humanitarian needs and with a view to enhancing the promotion of solidarity and
the visibility of humanitarian aid among Union citizens, there is a need to develop solidarity between Member States and
with third countries affected by man-made or natural disasters. Contributing to assistance to people and communities
outside the Union in need of humanitarian aid, based on the fundamental principles of neutrality, humanity, independence
and impartiality, is an important expression of solidarity.
Activities implemented under the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps aim at contributing to providing needs-based
humanitarian aid aimed at preserving life, preventing and alleviating human suffering and maintaining human dignity and to
strengthening the capacity and resilience of vulnerable or disaster-affected communities. Humanitarian Aid Volunteering
projects funded under this strand will offer the opportunity to young people aged 18 to 35 years old to participate in
volunteering activities, aiming at supporting humanitarian aid operations. Such activities will provide young people with the
opportunity to carry out tasks needed to support the activities undertaken by their host organisation.
To ensure the safety of participants, volunteering under this strand may only take place in countries:
 where humanitarian aid activities and operations take place; and
 where there are no ongoing international or non-international armed conflicts.
NB: The Action ‘Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects’ is not covered under this Guide and will be open under a
subsequent call for proposals. In order to be able to take part in volunteering activities under this strand, organisations need
to hold a Quality Label for volunteering under this strand. This section therefore covers all relevant information and criteria
for the Quality Label, pre-requisite for organisations to participate in Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects, enabling
organisations that wish to participate in the strand to prepare and apply for the relevant Quality Label, and be ready and
compliant with all the standards and requirements necessary to engage in project activities.
51QUALITY LABEL FOR HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING
WHAT IS THE QUALITY LABEL?
The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering certifies that an organisation is able to carry out high quality solidarity
activities in compliance with the principles, objectives and requirements of the action ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian
Aid Corps’. Obtaining this Quality Label is a precondition for participation only in volunteering activities in support of
humanitarian aid operations.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUALITY LABEL?
When applying for a Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering, applicant organisations can choose one of the
following roles:
 Support role - entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, mediation between
them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity. The
support role also entitles the organisation to submit project applications and coordinate partnerships for
Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects;
 Host role - covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant, including the
development of a programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the
participant during all the phases as appropriate.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering is awarded following a selection process, involving three main stages:
submission of application, assessment and award.
The applications for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering can be submitted on a continuous basis (i.e. at any
time) during the programming period, to the Executive Agency, which is the sole implementing body for this action. The
applications will be evaluated at set intervals, according to an annual timetable, which is aligned to the timetable of the
Humanitarian Aid Volunteering call for projects.
Applications will be assessed against eligibility, selection, exclusion and award criteria (for more information on the selection
and exclusion criteria, see Part E of this Guide). Successful organisations will be awarded the Quality Label for Humanitarian
Aid Volunteering. The Executive Agency will award this Quality Label and monitor compliance and may carry out periodical
reassessments. The Quality Label will be valid for the entire duration of the programming period and until the end of the
last project in which the organisation is involved.
In order to facilitate partner-finding and the setting up of project consortia, profiles of all organisations holding this Quality
Label are published in a database45 of Quality Label organisations on the European Solidarity Corps Portal. To identify
potential partners, partner searching tool on the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal46 can be used.
Once awarded a Quality Label, organisations gain access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal where they are invited to
advertise activities. Organisations have to make use of the European Solidarity Corps Portal's database to search for
potential partners and participants. Information in the database is published as it is formulated in the Quality Label
application form.
APPLYING FOR A QUALITY LABEL ON BEHALF OF HOSTING ORGANISATIONS – THE SIMPLIFIED
HOST PROCEDURE
An organisation established in a programme country that applies for support role may also apply for host role on behalf of
its branches located in non programme countries with which it shares the same legal personality (simplified hosting
procedure). This procedure is designed to help larger organisations, with several branches located in different countries.
The applicant supporting organisation is accountable for the quality and safety of the activities offered by the simplified
hosting organisation(s) on behalf of which it is applying.

52Part D – Quality and support measures
TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS FOR ORGANISATIONS HOLDING AN EU AID VOLUNTEERS
CERTIFICATION
The organisations which have been awarded an EU Aid Volunteers certification under the EU Aid Volunteers initiative
(programme period 2014-2020) and that wish to continue to participate in the new European Solidarity Corps programme
will have the possibility to apply for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering by following a lighter procedure
compared to organisations without the EU Aid Volunteers certification. In order to qualify for this procedure, these
organisations will be required to hold a valid EUAV certification at application stage.
EU Aid Volunteers certified sending and hosting organisations are considered to already fulfil essential requirements for the
award of the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering notable in relation to safety and security measures,
documentation of humanitarian aid experience, travel, working and living conditions of volunteers, equal treatment policies
etc.
WHAT ARE THE QUALITY STANDARDS ?
The European Solidarity Corps guarantees high-quality volunteering activities, through the Quality Label process.
Participating organisations must respect the following principles and standards:
 Equal opportunities and non-discrimination. Volunteers are to be selected in a fair, transparent and objective
way, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion or disability. No previous
qualifications, educational level, specific experience or language knowledge must be required. A more specific
profile of the volunteer might be drawn up if justified by the nature of the tasks of the activity or by the project
context. In order to promote inclusion, participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the
volunteer, with the exception of possible contributions to travel costs (if the grant does not fully cover these
costs). The activities should respect the principles set out in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities.
 Avoidance of job substitution. Volunteering activities must not substitute traineeships or jobs, so that any
adverse effect on potential or existing paid employment is avoided. The involvement of volunteers should
complement the work of paid staff. They should not replace paid staff or undercut their pay and conditions of
service.
 Avoidance of harmful activities. Security and safety of the participants, participating organisations and target
groups must be ensured. Such security and safety should include appropriate clearance requirements for
participants working with vulnerable groups in accordance with applicable national law. Volunteering activities
should be implemented with due consideration for the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as
environmental crises, conflicts or pandemics. The activities should respect the principles set out in the EU
Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child47.
 Provision of high quality, easily accessible and inclusive activities. The volunteering tasks should enable
participants to develop skills and competencies for personal, social and civic development. Particular attention
will be given to the capacity of hosting organisations in third countries and the need to embed the activities of
volunteers within the local context and to facilitate volunteers’ interaction with local humanitarian actors, the
hosting community and civil society. The value and benefits of European Solidarity Corps volunteering should be
recognised for volunteers, through validation of learning outcomes.
 Adequate training, working and volunteering arrangements. Safe and decent living and working conditions must
be ensured for participants. The young people and the organisations must sign a volunteering agreement that
will outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and will include a well-defined set of volunteering tasks.
 “no profit”. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, beneficiaries must not derive any profit from the
activities funded by the grants awarded. Furthermore, volunteering should cover the participants’ expenditure
arising from participation in such solidarity activities but should not provide them with salaries or an economic
benefit.
TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ORGANISATIONS HOLDING A QUALITY LABEL FOR
HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING
In addition to complying with the above-mentioned principles, organisations implementing humanitarian aid volunteering
projects must carry out specific tasks and responsibilities in order to ensure high quality activities. When applying for a
Quality Label, organisations must be able to demonstrate their capacity to perform the tasks and take up responsibilities
relevant to the role they are applying for, as outlined in the requirements below. This list is not comprehensive and, in some

MONITORING, REPORTING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
CHANGING/UPDATING THE QUALITY LABEL
The organisations holding a Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering must notify the awarding body of any changes
in their organisation that should be reflected in their Quality Label.
MONITORING AND CHECKS
The Quality Label will be periodically reassessed. The Executive Agency may carry out regular or ad hoc monitoring visits to
verify that the organisations holding a Quality Label still meet the quality standards.
TERMINATION
In cases of serious underperformance, failure to comply with Executive Agency’s instructions and deadlines or repeated
violations of the Programme rules, the Quality Label can be withdrawn. The Executive Agency will give due consideration to
each case of non-compliance and will prompt the organisation well in advance to allow enough time to take corrective
measures.
In addition, the awarding body may terminate a Quality Label if the organisation ceases to exist.
59P D –Q
ART UALITY AND SUPPORT MEASURES
In this Part, readers will find the following information:
 a description of the support measures;
 a description of their objectives and for whom they are;
 additional information on key elements of the participation in a European Solidarity Corps project.
The Quality and Support measures described in this section are relevant only for the Actions covered under this Guide.
Before submitting an application, applicants are advised to read carefully the entire section.
WHICH MEASURES ARE SUPPORTED?
The European Solidarity Corps provides a range of quality and support services for participants and participating
organisations. These measures vary depending on the Action and the type of activity the participants and organisations are
involved in. .
 Support to learning
 General Online Training;
 Language Learning Support;
 Training and Evaluation cycle;
 Mentoring;
 Recognition of Learning Outcomes.
 Insurance
 European Solidarity Corps Portal
 Other important elements
 Certificate of participation;
 Agreements;
 Visa.
WHAT ARE THE AIMS OF THESE MEASURES?
Insofar as quality and support measures are concerned, the specific objectives of the European Solidarity Corps shall be
pursued through actions that aim:
 to ensure compliance with the principles and objectives of the European Solidarity Corps on the part of all public
and private organisations seeking to participate in the activities of the European Solidarity Corps;
 to ensure that the solidarity activities that are offered to the European Solidarity Corps participants contribute to
addressing concrete, unmet societal needs and strengthening communities and are of high quality and properly
validated.
60Part D – Quality and Support measures
SUPPORT TO LEARNING
To support, reinforce and complement the learning acquired through participation in the activities, specific quality and
support measures are foreseen: the General Online Training, language learning support, the Training and Evaluation Cycle,
mentoring and recognition of learning outcomes.
GENERAL ONLINE TRAINING
WHAT IS THE GENERAL ONLINE TRAINING?
The General Online Training is a set of training modules for the registered candidates and participants selected for an
activity provided via the European Solidarity Corps' portal. General Online Training is a general induction with various
modules that apply to participants and registrants, regardless of their status within the European Solidarity Corps. Topics
include: the mission of the European Solidarity Corps, ethics, integrity, roles and responsibilities of the participants,
European values, inter-cultural awareness, thematic training, health and safety etc. The objective of the training is to
support European Solidarity Corps registered candidates in their engagement in quality solidarity activities and contribute to
the building of the community of the European Solidarity Corps. The training should become part of a non-formal learning
process of European Solidarity Corps participants who will be involved in specific projects and for the registered candidates
in the portal not yet selected to capture their attention and stimulate their motivation. Likewise, the General Online Training
will include a Guidebook that is deemed suitable for youth workers to both enrich the General Online Training experience
and empower young people to also carry out activities offline.
FOR WHOM?
General Online Training is available to the registered candidates and participants selected for an activity via the European
Solidarity Corps' portal.
61LANGUAGE LEARNING SUPPORT
WHAT IS THE LANGUAGE LEARNING SUPPORT?
Language learning support is available for participants carrying out a solidarity activity in the framework of the European
Solidarity Corps. Depending on the Action, Language learning support takes the form either of a grant, either of an online
course via the Online Language Support platform. Online courses are encouraged as e-learning offers advantages for
language learning in terms of access and flexibility. The Online Language Support platform (OLS) allow participants to assess,
practise and improve their knowledge of the language chosen. The platform will provide features such as social networking
to enable collaborative learning as well as free language learning material. The provision of linguistic support shall be based
on mutual trust between organisations who should ensure appropriate linguistic support. Other forms for support may be
offered to support the language learning needs of particular target groups. A specific grant for language learning support
may be provided for that purpose. In such cases, such language learning must be arranged by the participating
organisations. Beneficiaries of this grant should encourage participants to start learning the language before their activity.
Furthermore, organisations involved can use the "organisational support" grant to address the needs of participants in
terms of pedagogical, task-related, intercultural or specific linguistic preparation (see the "funding rules" section in Part B of
this Guide).
FOR WHOM?
Participants in volunteering activities and Solidarity Projects are eligible to receive language learning support through the
Online Language Support Platform. In justified cases, participants undertaking a volunteering activity may be eligible for a
grant.
TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE
WHAT IS THE TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE (TEC)?
One of the key features of the European Solidarity Corps is the training and evaluation it provides to participating
organisations and participants. Firstly, guiding young participants through a non-formal learning process before, during and
after their period of activity. Secondly, supporting Quality Label organisations in offering a qualitative frame for the
experience to take place. The training and evaluation dimension within the European Solidarity Corps aims at:
 Providing young participants with continuous guidance and support throughout their activity period. Such
training and evaluation contributes to the education and development of each young person and facilitates
contacts between participants, participating organisations and National Agencies / SALTOs (Support, Advanced
Learning and Training Opportunities centres). It also helps resolve conflicts and prevent risks, and it provides a
means of assessing the participants' experience. The training and evaluation cycle for participants complements
other ongoing support offered by the participating organisations before and during the activity period;
 Providing organisations involved with the necessary support and tools to develop and carry out qualitative
projects as well as the opportunity to exchange and network with other European Solidarity Corps actors.
Quality is the main objective of preparation, training and evaluation. Given the diversity of countries, National Agencies,
organisations holding a Quality Label and participants, there is a large degree of flexibility in the training format, whereas
the quality indicators should be common to all training sessions.
What follows outlines the minimum that should be covered by a training/evaluation session. Trainers and organisers are of
course free to add any country-specific or project-specific features they deem necessary or interesting for the people
attending their training/evaluation event. The minimum quality standards clarify what can be expected to be achieved at a
training/evaluation session, whether by the organisers of the event, the project supervisors, the mentors or the participants
themselves. At the same time, concerning training of participants, the National Agencies, regional SALTOs and the
participating organisations should as far as possible try to ensure that the training/evaluation opportunities offered to each
participant are in line with their specific needs.
Training providers can link the different training/evaluation stages while avoiding any overlaps in the content, and can thus
help create a continuous learning process for the participants before, during and following their activity period.
In addition to the Training and Evaluation Cycle, participants receive continuous counselling and guidance before, during
and after the activity period, while training for project managers, mentors and trainers adds up to a complex set of
measures, accompanying participants and participating organisations throughout the European Solidarity Corps experience.
FOR WHOM IS THE TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE?
 Participants: The training and evaluation cycle is mandatory for volunteers. Participants in Solidarity Projects can
take part only in annual event.
 Organisations holding a Quality Label.
62Part D – Quality and Support measures
TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE FOR PARTICIPANTS – HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Training and Evaluation Cycle for participants consists of the following sessions:
 pre-departure training for participants in cross-border volunteering activities – ensured by support organisations
for individual volunteering or host/support organisation for volunteering teams (for those volunteers coming
from countries other than the one where the activity takes place).
 on-arrival training for participants in volunteering activities of at least 2 months – ensured by National Agencies
(in case of volunteering in Programme countries), SALTOs (in case of volunteering in partner countries), host or
support organisations (in case of individual volunteering activity of less than 2 months and volunteering teams).
 mid-term evaluation (only volunteering activities of 6 months and longer) – ensured by National Agencies or
SALTOs;
In addition to the above sessions, an annual European Solidarity corps event is foreseen for all participants taking part in
Volunteering and those implementing Solidarity Projects. Volunteers have the right and obligation to attend the pre-
departure training, the on-arrival training and the mid-term evaluation sessions and the participating organisations must
ensure that their participants take part in the TEC, which is considered an integral part of the activity. Given the different
requirements of information between participants in cross-border and in-country activities or volunteering, the training
providers can tailor the content of the trainings to each target group.
PRE-DEPARTURE TRAINING
In order for the project to be successful and the European Solidarity Corps experiences to be positive and enriching for the
participant, it is crucial that the support or host organisation adequately prepares the participant prior to departure. This
training is only mandatory to participants in cross-border volunteering activities. This preparation should take place at least
one month before departure and should be tailored to the individual needs of the participant and the specificities of the
project, the activity and the host country. The organisation in charge of the training is responsible for ensuring that the Info-
Kit is given to all participants involved in its project.
It is essential to provide information on "What to expect from the European Solidarity Corps" (part of the Info-Kit) — as well
as on the basics of conflict prevention and crisis management. It must provide participants with practical and technical
information on matters such as insurance, visa, pocket money and working hours, etc.
Whereas the main responsibility of organising the pre-departure training lies with the applicant organisation, the National
Agencies may organise a one-day pre-departure information session to establish contact with outgoing participants and
make sure they are prepared for their upcoming activities by the support organisations.
ON-ARRIVAL TRAINING
The main objective of the on-arrival training is to introduce the participants to the host country, preparing them for the
activity period and the European Solidarity Corps experience. On-arrival training helps the participants adapt to cultural and
personal challenges. It allows participants to get to know each other and to build a network. Participants should also receive
guidance on conflict prevention and crisis management. They should be informed about environmentally sustainable
behaviour that the Programme encourages.
At the same time, this training session equips the participants with communication skills, including aspects of intercultural
learning. It helps them become aware that cultural differences require different models of behaviour. The training is also a
good time for the participants to plan the coming months and to develop their own personal goals for their activity period,
in line with the non-formal learning philosophy of the European Solidarity Corps.
On-arrival training for long-term cross-border and in-country participants is organised by the National Agencies or SALTOs.
For volunteers in activities with a duration of less than two months, the host or support organisation has to organise a
training in line with the minimum quality standards detailed in the table below, although possibly with a shorter duration.
MID-TERM EVALUATION
The mid-term evaluation allows participants to assess their experience up to that point and to reflect on the activities, role
and support of the host organisation and on their own contribution. The evaluation provides the opportunity to learn from
everybody’s experience and enables the participants to plan developments and/or further improvements in their activity
and to think about what they will do in the longer term, once their experience is over. The evaluation should also raise
awareness of the personal learning process, linking it to the key competences of the Youthpass and Europass. Mid-term
evaluation is also mandatory for in-country participants.
It is essential that the event is designed as a meeting between participants. It takes place long enough after their arrival for
the participants to have gained enough experience to review their situation, but also sufficiently long before the end of the
activity period so that there is still time to improve the situation if necessary.
63ANNUAL EVENTS
The European Solidarity Corps event is an opportunity to bring together former, current and potential participants in
Volunteering and Solidarity Projects. The event is organised by the National Agencies or SALTOs. It may serve as an
evaluation meeting, alumni meeting and/or promotional event. It is particularly important as an opportunity for those who
have finished their solidarity activity during the past year to discuss and evaluate their experiences and to pass them on to
current and potential participants. One of the objectives of the event is to ensure that the National Agency receives
feedback about the projects, the participating organisations, the practical arrangements and the overall impression of the
participation in the activities. A key question will be what learning effect the activity period had for the participant.

64EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS
The pre-departure preparation will vary according to training practices, organisational possibilities and
participant needs. Nevertheless, pre-departure preparation should ensure that, by the time they
leave, all participants:
 know about the concept of the European Solidarity Corps;
 are familiar with the partners involved in the activity, i.e. the host and support organisation
in volunteering activities, the mentor and, where applicable, the National/Executive
Agency, Resource Centres and the European Commission;
 are familiar with the documents in the Info-Kit;
 are encouraged to profit from the learning opportunities in the General Online Training;
 have shared their motivations, expectations and fears, and have reflected on their goals,
Pre-departure including goals for learning;
training  have received appropriate practical and technical information on visas, residence permits,
their legal status as a participant, their insurance (including guidance on how to obtain the
mandatory European Health Insurance Card before the departure), pocket money, the
relevant agreement under the European Solidarity Corps;
 understand the meaning of intercultural learning and are aware of the ongoing intercultural
learning process;
 have received guidance or at least hints on crisis management;
 are aware about sustainability dimension of the Programme
 understand the importance and usefulness of getting recognition for the individual learning
outcomes, in particular through EU level tools such as Youthpass and Europass.
The training should also contain modules for language learning in the host country's language or the
language used in the context of the activity if such language training is not offered through the Online
Language Support or through grants for language learning..
On-arrival training will vary according to national conditions, realities and training practices.
Nevertheless, it should ensure that each participant:
 is aware of and has the chance to discuss questions about visas, residence permits, her/his
legal status as a participant, insurance, the agreement under European Solidarity Corps,
and the documents in the Info-Kit;
 has received information about adapting to a foreign working environment, rights and
obligations, useful contacts to help with his/her settlement, etc.;
 knows the insurance and claims management systems (insurance documentation and
procedures), and is fully aware that using the European Health Insurance Card when
possible is mandatory;
 knows what support is available from the National Agency and SALTO;
 has received information on the host country's history, political and social situation, on key
aspects of the host culture and on how to get involved in the local community;
On-arrival
 is aware of how to deal with cultural differences and with conflicts;
training
 is familiar with the role of each participating organisation in the activity and knows her/his
own rights and responsibilities;
 is informed about the environmentally sustainable behaviour that the Programme
promotes;
 has the chance to meet and network with other participants;
 receives basic information about the European Union and its policies and programmes in
the field of youth;

When needed, support should be offered to participants following the Online Linguistic Support for
taking language assessments and courses.
65European Solidarity Corps Guide
Mid-term evaluations will vary according to national conditions, realities and training practices.
Nevertheless, by the end of the evaluation, each participant should have:
 personally assessed the activity so far and reflected on the scope of his/her activities;
 shared personal experiences (learning new skills and competences, being part of
community life, living within a different culture, using the language);
Mid-term
 identified problems, difficulties, conflicts faced or about to be faced and consequently
evaluation
received satisfying support and clues on the ‘next steps’ to solve these problems;
 worked on developing/improving the activities he/she is involved in;
 received information and guidance on opportunities he/she could be involved in after the
period of activity;
 understood how to use EU level recognition tools, such as Youthpass and Europass, to
identify and document individual learning outcomes;
 received information about the Participant Report to be filled-in.
Events will vary according to national conditions, realities and practices. Nevertheless, by the end of
the event, each participant who has finished their activity during the past year should have evaluated
their experience in terms of:
 the cooperation between the participant and the participating organisations, and the
personal support and supervision received;
 their personal contribution to the activity;
 the overall pedagogical approach and their own learning achievements (personal,
professional, social), including being aware of their personal capacities and skills and (if
relevant) having finalised their Youthpass and Europass;
 their increased knowledge about Europe, changes in their attitude towards Europe and
Annual event their greater understanding of diversity;
 having shared their experience with peers.
Moreover, the event may be:
 a chance for potential participants and participating organisations to meet experienced
participants, including participants having implemented Solidarity Projects;
 an opportunity to promote the European Solidarity Corps and its impact through contacts
with stakeholders, decision-makers and the media;
 a networking event to explore and develop new projects and other ways of using their
experiences;
 a showcase for successful projects;
 a celebration of solidarity and a step towards the reinforcement of the European Solidarity
Corps community.
TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE FOR ORGANISATIONS – HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Training and Evaluation Cycle for organisations consists of the following:
 training for organisations having been awarded recently the Quality Label;
 an annual event for organisations holding the Quality Label.
National Agencies are responsible for organising such trainings for all organisations holding a Quality Label in their country.
For organisations in partner countries neighbouring the EU, the relevant SALTOs are the ones in charge. NAs/SALTOs may
decide not to organise such trainings if other instruments are in place to ensure monitoring and quality implementation.
National Agencies / SALTOs can opt to delegate all or some of the sessions to subcontractors. However, the NAs/SALTOs
should remain involved in the sessions as much as possible and keep regular contact with the trainers.
Organisations holding a Quality Label are recommended to attend these sessions.
TRAINING FOR ORGANISATIONS HOLDING THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS QUALITY LABEL
In order for the project to be successful and the experiences to be positive and enriching for all actors involved,
organisations participating in the European Solidarity Corps which have been awarded a Quality Label need to have a
thorough understanding of the core values and features of the Corps. During the training, these organisations will focus on
the elements needed for a successful experience and reflections on how their project should be thought through and
developed.
The training should:
 ensure understanding of each organisation's roles and responsibilities;
66 give appropriate practical and technical information on the project management;
 raise awareness on the important features of the programme such as specific support for young people with
fewer opportunities, EU level recognition tools such as Youthpass and Europass, Online Language Support, role of
the mentor, etc.;
 provide necessary support and tools to develop and carry out qualitative mentorship;
 support organisations in developing qualitative projects (selection of partners and participants, development of
the tasks of the participants, crisis management, dissemination, etc.) ;
 provide networking and partner-building opportunities for organisations.
ANNUAL EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS EVENT
This yearly event should gather representatives of all European Solidarity Corps organisations holding a Quality Label with
the aim of sharing experiences, ideas and practices, showcasing success stories, and developing and reinforcing networks /
partner building. The event is also the opportunity to remind the core values and features of the programme. It will,
additionally, allow assessing the difficulties encountered by organisations and the reasons of inactivity of some Quality
Labelled organisations. This event can be combined with the Annual European Solidarity Corps event for participants.
MENTORING
MENTORING IN VOLUNTEERING ACTIVITIES
Personal support through mentoring should be provided to all participants in volunteering activities. Mentoring consists of
regular meetings between the mentor appointed by the host or support organisation and the participant, within as well as
outside the place where the activity takes place. The meetings should focus on the personal wellbeing of the participants
and should also guide and provide support to the volunteers in identifying the learning acquired during their experience.
Mentoring is targeted towards the individual participant and thus the content and frequency of the meetings will vary
according to the individual needs. Possible topics of mentoring meetings: personal wellbeing, wellbeing in the team,
satisfaction with the tasks, practicalities, etc.
REINFORCED MENTORSHIP
'Reinforced Mentorship' is an intensified mentoring process that might be necessary to support young people with fewer
opportunities, if they are not able to implement an activity independently or with normal mentoring or tutoring support.
This type of mentoring is applicable to volunteering activities. Reinforced Mentorship involves closer contact, more frequent
meetings and more time allocated to the implementation of tasks. This guarantees a step-by-step support of the
participants during project activities as well as outside working hours. Reinforced Mentorship enables the participants to
gain as much autonomy as possible, thus contributing to the successful implementation of the project.
67European Solidarity Corps Guide
RECOGNITION OF LEARNING OUTCOMES
WHAT IS RECOGNITION OF LEARNING OUTCOMES?
To support the impact of European Solidarity Corps activities on the personal, educational, social, civic and professional
development of the participants, the competences (combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes) that are the non-formal
and informal learning outcomes gained in the solidarity activities shall be identified and documented, in particular through
EU level recognition tools such as Youthpass and Europass.
FOR WHOM?
The identification and documentation of non-formal and informal learning outcomes is offered to participants (on a
voluntary basis) and participating organisations (mandatory, insofar as the participant requests it). This means that every
young person taking part in any European Solidarity Corps activity can benefit from a process and certificate that identifies
and documents individual learning outcomes.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
Every young person taking part in European Solidarity Corps activities is entitled to go through the Youthpass process and
receive a Youthpass certificate at the end of the process. Youthpass identifies and documents the competences developed
during the project. It is recommended to embed the educational approach of Youthpass from the start of the project and
use it during the project activities as a tool to help participants to become more aware of, reflect on and assess their
learning process and outcomes. Depending on the nature of the recognition needs and the individual solidarity activities,
other tools can also be used such as e.g. Europass.
For more information and support on Youthpass: www.youthpass.eu
For more information on Europass: www.europass.eu
68INSURANCE
WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT INSURANCE?
One key aspect of the activities carried out under the European Solidarity Corps is that the participant must at all time be
under a safe environment. To guarantee that the participant in Volunteering activities is covered for unforeseen
circumstances, the following areas must be covered:
 wherever relevant, travel insurance (including damage or loss of luggage);
 third party liability (including, wherever appropriate, professional/corporate liability of participating
organisations);
 accident and illness (including permanent or temporary incapacity), pregnancy and childbirth;
 death (including repatriation in case of projects carried out abroad).
The European Solidarity Corps supports insurance coverage, when needed:
 either through the insurance provided by the European Commission (for cross-border activities);
 either through reimbursement of the costs linked to insurance (for in-country activities).
FOR CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITIES
Participants in cross-border activities must be in the possession of a European Health Insurance Card before arriving to the
host country. This card gives access to medically necessary, state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in any of the
EU Member States, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, under the same conditions and at the same cost (free in
some countries) as people insured in these respective countries49.
In particular, the European Solidarity Corps provides insurance coverage, from the moment participants leave their
residence to the host country until the end of the second month after the end or termination of the activity, as following:
 Those participants who are not eligible for the European Health Insurance Card free of charge (ie, at no cost for
the participant), or those not entitled for reason of the national regulatory framework regarding the activities they
perform or their individual situation, shall be entitled to receive a primary coverage through the insurance
provided by the European Commission.
 Those that are eligible to a European Health Insurance Card free of charge or are registered in the host country’s
national health system will obtain complementary coverage from the insurance. Information about the coverage
and support available through the insurance for participants, as well as instructions for enrolment, is available on
the website of the insurance company.
FOR IN-COUNTRY ACTIVITIES
If the participant is in need of private personal insurance given the national regulatory framework, the participating
organisations must provide the participant with personal insurance, which must offer the same coverage as the coverage for
cross-border activities, in particular coverage not related to the activity for its entire duration. Should this private insurance
be needed, the organisation may use exceptional costs to fund it.
For in-country activities, the European Commission does not define a unique format of third party liability insurance, nor
does it recommend specific insurance companies. It is it up to project organisers to seek the most suitable insurance policy
according to the type of project carried out and to the insurance formats available at national level. It is not necessary to
subscribe to a project-specific insurance, if the participants are already covered by existing insurance policies of the project
organisers.
49 More information on the card and on how to obtain it is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=559
69European Solidarity Corps Guide
INSURANCE PROVIDED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
FOR WHOM?
Every participant in a cross-border activity must be enrolled in the insurance scheme of the European Solidarity Corps or in
the host country’s national health system. The insurance complements the coverage of the mandatory European Health
Insurance Card and/or national social security systems.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
For activities supported under Volunteering Projects, the beneficiary organisation is responsible for the management of its
project in the IT tool provided by the European Commission for the management of projects (Beneficiary Module). The
beneficiary must encode all information about the activity the participants are involved in. The enrolment of the
participants to the insurance scheme is done automatically through the system and based on the information input there.
The enrolment to the insurance must be done before the departure of the participant(s), the beneficiary must therefore
input the information in the system prior to the start of the activity. The enrolment covers the duration of the activity,
including travel days. In addition, the beneficiary is responsible for keeping the information in the beneficiary module
updated in particular regarding the start and end dates of the activity, venue etc. as this information is linked to the
insurance coverage. For activities supported under Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas, the beneficiary organisation is
responsible for enrolling the participants directly on the insurance dedicated website50.
The insurance provides only complementary coverage to the European Health Insurance Card or to any other insurance
participants may have. Participants must be in possession of their European Health Insurance Card before the departure. In
certain cases, when national rules deprive volunteers from coverage under the European Health Insurance Card for the
duration of the activity, the insurance company will provide full coverage (see above). The insurance coverage has its own
exclusions and ceilings and it is meant to cope with urgent and necessary care which cannot wait until the end of the activity
period and the return home of the participant.
Finally, participants and organisations should take into account that it is a private insurance scheme. As such, it is highly
recommended to contact the insurer before incurring a medical expense, as they will be able to provide the participant with
information on whether the claim will be reimbursed, and how.
The following flow process chart explains each possible insurance coverage. It must be noted that, regardless of the activity
and type of insurance coverage, the organisation is ultimately responsible to ensure the participant is appropriately insured.
50 Further information on the procedure to follow will be provided once the project is granted.
7071European Solidarity Corps Guide
EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS PORTAL
The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers European and national information and opportunities that are of interest to
young people wishing to engage in the solidarity sector. It provides a one-stop shop for both interested young people and
organisations wishing to join and to be part of the Corps. The Portal also allows young people to follow online trainings, get
access to other services and, importantly, to build a community of like-minded young people. To access the European
Solidarity Corps Portal, go to: http://europa.eu/youth/solidarity.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
BRINGING TOGETHER YOUNG PEOPLE AND ORGANISATIONS
Young people - at least 17 years old - wishing to engage in solidarity activities register in the European Solidarity Corps
Portal. The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers a place for those young people and organisations holding a Quality Label
and willing to implement solidarity activities to find each other. In the Portal, organisations holding a Quality Label can
advertise opportunities for volunteering activities, search for registered candidates and contact them. Registered candidates
can also look for opportunities and express their interest in them. Once the organisation and the registered candidate found
each other, the organisation sends an offer to the registered candidate.
BUILDING COMMUNITY AND PROVIDING SERVICES
The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers additional services to registered candidates. In addition to the Online Training
made available through the Portal, registered candidates can benefit from community building activities, updated
information through newsletters and other useful functionalities that are gradually being developed. Young people
registered can also make use of the mobile app, enabling them to exchange and share experiences with the other young
people registered in the Corps. They can also make a meaningful contribution to society through their engagement in the
European Solidarity Network (EuSN) or the EuroPeers network, among other networks.
72OTHER IMPORTANT FEATURES
CERTIFICATE OF PARTICIPATION
The certificate of participation is a certificate to support the visibility of the participation in European Solidarity Corps
activities. At the end of their solidarity activity, participants are entitled to receive a certificate of participation, issued in the
European Solidarity Corps portal provided that the activity is finalised and that participants have submitted their participant
report.
AGREEMENTS
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PROJECT PARTNERS
All participating organisations involved in a European Solidarity Corps project are strongly recommended to sign an internal
agreement between them. Such an agreement has the purpose of clearly defining responsibilities, tasks and financial
contribution for all parties involved in the activities. It is up to the participating organisations to jointly decide on how the
EU grant will be distributed and which costs it will cover.
An internal agreement constitutes a key instrument for ensuring a solid and smooth cooperation among partners in a
solidarity activity as well as to avoid or manage potential conflicts. Indicatively, it should contain at least the following
information:
 reference of the grant agreement between the applicant participating organisation and the granting Agency;
 names and contacts of all the participating organisations involved in the activities;
 role and responsibilities of each participating organisation; division of the EU grant;
 modalities of payments and budget transfers among participating organisations.
Although this practice is strongly recommended to safeguard the interests of each partner, such an agreement remains an
internal document among partners; it will not be requested by the granting National Agency.
AGREEMENTS WITH PARTICIPANTS
Prior to their departure, each young person participating in an individual volunteering activity supported by the European
Solidarity Corps must sign a participant agreement using the template provided by the European Commission that defines at
least the following aspects of the solidarity activity:
 rights and responsibilities with regards to insurance and financial contribution from the Corps;
 tasks to be carried out during the activity;
 intended learning outcomes.
VISA AND RESIDENCE PERMITS
Participants in European Solidarity Corps projects may need to obtain a visa for staying abroad in or coming from a
neighbouring Partner Country hosting the activity. It is a responsibility of all the participating organisations to ensure that
the authorisations required (short or long-term stay visas or residence permits) are in order before the planned activity
takes place. It is strongly recommended that the authorisations are requested from the competent authorities well in
advance, since the process may take several weeks. National Agencies and the Executive Agency may give further advice and
support concerning visas, residence permits, social security, etc. The EU Immigration Portal contains general information on
visa and residence permits, for both short-term and long-term stays: https://ec.europa.eu/immigration/node_en.
73P E - I
ART NFORMATION FOR APPLICANTS
All potential applicants (including groups of young people in the case of solidarity projects assimilated here below to
‘organisations’) that intend to submit a project proposal in order to receive financial support from the EU or a Quality Label
under the European Solidarity Corps are invited to read carefully this section which is drafted in accordance with the
applicable provisionsof the Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July
2018 applicable to the general budget of the European Union51 (hereinafter "EU Financial Regulation").
All the contractual and financial provisions that apply to the grants awarded are presented in the model grant agreements,
which are made available on the websites of the European Commission or the National Agencies, and for the Executive
Agency in the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal52. In case of discrepancies with the information presented in this
Guide, provisions of the Model Grant Agreements prevail on those of Part E. Many of the steps described and information
provided are also relevant for organisations wishing to apply for Quality Label.
Individuals are not entitled to submit project proposals in the framework of the European Solidarity Corps, except for
individuals applying on behalf of a group of (at least five) young people wishing to carry out a Solidarity Project (hereafter
defined as "Groups of young people").
WHAT TO DO IN ORDER TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION?
To submit a European Solidarity Corps project, applicants must follow the four steps described below:
 Organisations/groups of young people involved in the application must register and receive an identification
code. Organisations/groups of young people that have already obtained such an identification code do not need
to register again;
 Check the compliance with the criteria for the relevant Action;
 Check the financial conditions (only applicable to requests for funding, not relevant for Quality Label);
 Fill in and submit the application form.
STEP 1: REGISTER THE ORGANISATION
Organisations/groups of young people involved in any application must be registered and provide their basic legal and
financial data in either the Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps platform for projects submitted to National Agencies or
in the Participant Register Portal for projects submitted at the Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA).
Once the registration is completed, the organisation/group will obtain an organisation ID (if applications are submitted to
the NA) and a participant identification code (PIC) (if applications are submitted to EACEA). This code, which is an identifier
and is necessary for the submission of applications, enables the organisation/group to fill-in the online application forms in
a simpler manner (i.e. by inserting the code in the form, all the information provided by the organisation/group at
registration stage will be automatically displayed in the form).
Please note that organisations/groups of young people that have already participated in an Erasmus+ and European
Solidarity Corps actions and holding a PIC do not need to register again to apply at decentralised level. An organisation ID
was automatically assigned and can be found by using the search on the Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps platform.
WHERE TO REGISTER?
For actions managed by the National Agencies, to register in the Organisation Registration system of Erasmus+ and
European Solidarity Corps, the person representing an organisation (or a group of young people) must carry out the
following steps:
 Create an EU Login account (unless the person representing the organisation/ entities which do not have legal
personality already has an account). New EU Login accounts can be created via the following website:
https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/cas/eim/external/register.cgi;
 Access the Organisation Registration system for Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps
https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-esc and register on behalf of the organisation/group.
The organisation or group of young people need to register only once. Once the registration is completed, the
organisation/group of young people will obtain an Organisation ID.
For Actions managed by the Executive Agency, to register in the Funding & tender opportunities portal, the person
representing an organisation must carry out the following steps:
51 The EU Financial Regulation can be found at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1046
52 https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/home
74Part E – Information for Applicants
 Create an EU Login account (unless the person representing the organisation already has an account). New EU
Login accounts can be created via the following website: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/cas/
 Access the Register Portal https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/home and
register on behalf of the organisation. Guidance and Frequently Asked Questions are available on the portal.
The organisation needs to register only once. Once the registration is completed, the organisation will obtain a PIC.
PROOF OF LEGAL STATUS AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY
As part of the registration, applicants must also upload the following documents:
 The Legal Entity form. This form can be downloaded from the European Commission’s website at:
http://ec.europa.eu/budget/contracts_grants/info_contracts/legal_entities/legal_entities_en.cfm;
 The Financial Identification form. Please fill in the form relating to the country in which the bank is located, even
if the applicant organisation is officially registered in another country. This form can be downloaded at:
http://ec.europa.eu/budget/contracts_grants/info_contracts/financial_id/financial_id_en.cfm. The Financial
Identification form should be provided only for the applicant organisation, but is not required for the partner
organisations
For grant applications concerning amounts in excess of EUR 60 000, applicants may need to upload specific documents to
give proof of their financial capacity. For more details, see the section "Selection Criteria" below.
STEP 2: CHECK THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CRITERIA
When developing their project and before applying for EU support, participating organisations / groups of young people
must verify that the project respects the following criteria: admissibility, eligibility, exclusion, selection and award.
ADMISSIBILITY CRITERIA
Applications must be sent no later than the deadline for submitting applications as indicated in the call.
For actions managed by the National Agencies, applications must be submitted electronically via the forms available on the
website of the European Commission and the websites of the National Agencies.
For actions managed by the Executive Agency, applications must be submitted electronically via the Funding & Tenders
Portal Electronic Submission System. Applications (including annexes and supporting documents) must be submitted using
the forms provided in the Submission System. Applications are limited to 40 pages for calls for low value grants (EUR 60 000
or below); 70 for all other calls. Number of pages for Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid application is limited to 40 pages.
Evaluators will not consider any additional pages.
Applications must be readable and accessible. Applications must be complete containing all parts and mandatory annexes.
Only clerical errors can be corrected after the submission deadline upon request of the managing agency
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The eligibility criteria are used to determine whether the applicant is allowed to participate in a call for proposals and to
submit a proposal for an action. They apply to the applicants and to the activities for which the grant is requested: (e.g. type
of project or/and activities, implementation period, profile and/or the number of participants involved).
To be eligible, the activities and projects must meet all the eligibility criteria relating to the Action and activities under which
the proposal is submitted. If the application does not meet these criteria at application stage, it will be rejected without
being further evaluated. If it appears at implementation or final report stage that these criteria have not been fulfilled, the
activities may be considered ineligible with a consequent recovery of the EU grant initially awarded to the project.
The specific eligibility criteria applying to each of the Actions are described in Part B and C of the Guide.

complying with the main obligations in the implementation of a legal commitment financed by the EU.
Furthermore, the Commission considers that for the implementation of Actions covered by this Guide, the following
organisations are or could be in a situation of conflict of interest and therefore are or could be not eligible to participate:
 National Authorities in charge of supervising National Agencies and the implementation of the European
Solidarity Corps Programme in their country cannot apply or participate in any Action managed by National
Agencies in any country, but may apply for participation (as applicants or partners) in Actions managed by the
Executive Agency or by DG EAC unless that is explicitly excluded for the Action concerned (as indicated in Part B
of the Guide);
 National Agencies (sole activity of their legal entity) or National Agencies departments of legal entities dealing
with activities outside the remit of National Agencies cannot apply or participate in any Action implemented
through this Guide;
 Structures and networks identified or designated in the European Solidarity Corps Regulation or in any Annual
Commission Work programme adopted for the implementation of the European Solidarity Corps for specifically
receiving a financial contribution from the Commission under the implementation of the European Solidarity
Corps, which are hosted by the legal entity that also hosts the National Agency, cannot apply or participate in any
Action managed by National Agencies in any country, but may apply for participation (as applicants or partners)
in Actions managed by the Executive Agency or by DG EAC unless that is explicitly excluded for the Action
concerned (as indicated in Part B of the Guide); they should be able to demonstrate, before being awarded a
grant or a contract, that they are not in a conflict of interest either because precautionary measures are taken by
them or because their internal organisation is such that there is a clear separation of interests. Furthermore,
costs and revenues of each action or activity for which the EU funds are awarded must be identified. The decision
for admitting there is sufficient assurance they are not in an actual conflict of interest is taken by the Executive
Agency or by DG EAC, under their own responsibility and accountability, to which they apply;
 Legal entities hosting the National Agencies but dealing with other activities inside or outside the remit of the
European Solidarity Corps, as well as entities affiliated to these legal entities, cannot apply or participate in any
Action managed by National Agencies in any country, but may in principle apply for participation in Actions
managed by the Executive Agency or DG EAC unless that is explicitly excluded for the Action concerned (as
indicated in Part B of the Guide). However, they have to demonstrate, before being awarded a grant or a contract,
they are not in a conflict of interest either because precautionary measures are taken by them or because their
internal organisation is such that there is a clear separation of interests.(e.g. a minimum separation of accounts,
separation of reporting and decision making lines, measures to prevent access to privileged information).
Furthermore, costs and revenues of each action or activity for which the EU funds are awarded must be
identified. The decision for admitting there is sufficient assurance they are not in an actual conflict of interest is
taken by the Institution, under their own responsibility and accountability, to which they apply.
SELECTION CRITERIA
Through the selection criteria, the National or Executive Agency assesses the applicant's financial and operational capacity
to complete the proposed project.
FINANCIAL CAPACITY
Financial capacity means that the applicant has stable and sufficient sources of funding to maintain its activity throughout
the period during which the project is being carried out or the year for which the grant is awarded and to participate in its
funding.
The verification of the financial capacity does not apply to:
 public bodies, including Member States organisations;
 international organisations;
 if the individual grant requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60.000.
In case of EU grant requests submitted by other types of organisations than those mentioned above and not exceeding
EUR 60 000, applicants must provide a declaration on their honour certifying that they have the financial capacity to
implement the project. This declaration of honour constitutes a specific section of the application form.
In case of EU grant requests submitted by other types of organisations than those mentioned above and exceeding
EUR 60 000, the applicant must submit, in addition to the declaration of honour, the following documents through the
Funding & tender opportunities portal / Organisation Registration System :
 the applicant’s profit and loss account and;
 the balance sheet for the last financial year for which accounts were closed;
 other documents, if requested.
 Where the application concerns grants for a project for which the amount exceeds 750 000 EUR, in addition to
the above, an audit report produced by an approved external auditor may be requested. That report shall certify
the accounts for the last financial year available.
For entities which cannot provide the above documents because they are newly created, a financial declaration
or an insurance declaration stating the applicant's financial risks may replace the above documents.
78Part E – Information for Applicants
For Actions managed by the Executive Agency: Please also refer to the “Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment
and Financial Capacity Assessment”63. In case of a proposal submitted on behalf of a consortium of partners, should the
Executive Agency have doubts on the financial capacity of the consortium, it should carry out a risk-assessmentbased on
which the same documents as indicated above may be requested from the participating organisations. This is applicable
regardless the granted amount.
Organisations must upload these documents in the the Funding & tender opportunities portal / Organisation Registration
System either at the time of their registration (see section "Step1: Register the organisation" above), by the deadline
stipulated by the specific Action or when contacted by the EU validation services requesting the applicant to provide the
necessary supporting documents. In case of centralised actions, this request will be sent via the messaging system
embedded in the respective system.
If, following the analysis of the documents indicated above, the National or Executive Agency concludes that the required
financial capacity is weak, then they may:
 ask for further information;
 decide to give a pre-financing covered by (one or more) a bank guarantee;
 decide not to give pre-financing or give a reduced pre-financing;
 decide to give a pre-financing paid in several instalments;
 require an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility for all beneficiaries or
joint and several liability of affiliated entities
If the financial capacity is insufficient, the National or Executive Agency shall reject the application.
OPERATIONAL CAPACITY
Operational capacity means that the applicant has the necessary professional competencies and qualifications to carry out
the proposed project. Applicants must have the know-how, qualifications and resources to successfully implement the
projects and contribute their share (including sufficient experience in projects of comparable size and nature).
Public bodies, Member State organisations and international organisations are exempted from the operational capacity
check.
For Actions managed by the National Agencies, applicants must provide a declaration on their honour certifying that they
have the operational capacity to implement the project. In the case of the Quality Label, the operational capacity will be
assessed according to the relevant questions of the form. In addition, if required in the application form and if the grant
exceeds EUR 60 000, applicants may be asked to submit the curriculum vitae (CVs) of the key persons involved in the project
to demonstrate their relevant professional experience or other supporting documents such as:
 A list of relevant publications of the main team;
 An exhaustive list of previous projects and activities performed and connected to the policy field or to this
specific Action.
In addition, applicants under the Strand “Participation of young people in solidarity activities” for Quality Label for lead
organsiation must have at least one year of experience implementing activities making them eligible as applicants.
Experience preceding mergers or similar structural changes of public entities will be taken into account as relevant
experience in the meaning of this clause.
The above condition will be verified based on the application (including information about the applicant’s past participation
in the 2014-2020 Erasmus+ and/or European Solidarity Corps programme) and the documents submitted in the
Organisation Registration System. Applicants that do not complete the information requested in the application form may
be disqualified on this basis. The National Agency may ask for additional supporting documents to verify the information
included in the application.
For Actions managed by the Executive Agency, the operational capacity will be assessed in parallel with the ‘Quality’ award
criterion on the basis of the competence and experience of the applicants and their project teams, including operational
resources (human, technical and other) or, exceptionally, the measures proposed to obtain it by the time the task
implementation starts.
The applicants are considered to have sufficient operational capacity . when the requirements referring to the operational
capacity set in the call for proposals are met.
Applicants will have to show their capacity via the following information in the Application Form:
 general profiles (qualifications and experiences) of the staff responsible for managing and implementing the
project;
63 https://ec.europa.eu/info/fundingtenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/rules-lev-lear-fca_en.pdf
79 description of the consortium participants;
 list of EU-funded projects for the last 4 years.
The National Agency or the Executive Agency may ask for additional supporting documents to verify the information
included in the application.
AWARD CRITERIA
The award criteria allow the National or Executive Agency to evaluate the quality of the proposals submitted in the
framework of the European Solidarity Corps.
For Solidarity Projects and Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas, proposals that pass the individual quality thresholds
and the overall quality threshold will be considered for funding, within the limits of the available budget. The rest of the
proposals will be rejected.
The full set of award criteria applying to each of the Actions implemented through this Guide are described in Part B and C
of this Guide.
STEP 3: CHECK THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
FORMS OF GRANT
The grant may take the following form64:
 reimbursement of a specified proportion of the eligible costs actually incurred: e.g. the amount awarded to cover
additional costs linked to visa related costs;
 reimbursement on the basis of contribution to unit costs: e.g. the amount awarded for organisational support for
volunteering projects;
 a combination of the above.
The financing mechanism applied under the European Solidarity Corps in most cases provides grants based on the
reimbursement on the basis of contribution to unit costs. These types of grant help applicants to easily calculate the
requested grant amount and facilitate a realistic financial planning of the project. To know which type of grant is applied to
each funding item under each European Solidarity Corps activity covered by this Guide, please see the column "financing
mechanism" in the "funding rules" tables.
PRINCIPLES APPLYING TO EU GRANTS
NON RETROACTIVITY
No EU grant may be awarded retroactively for projects already completed.
An EU grant may be awarded for a project which has already begun only where the applicant can demonstrate the need to
start the project before the grant agreement has been signed. In such cases, the costs eligible for financing must not have
been incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant application65
If the applicant starts implementing the project before the grant agreement is signed, this is done at the risk of the
applicant.
MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS
In case of multiple submissions of the same application in the same selection round to the same National Agency or the
Executive Agency, the National or Executive Agency will always consider valid the last version submitted before the deadline
has expired.
For actions managed by the National Agencies, in case of multiple submissions of the same application by the same
applicant organisation to different Agencies, all applications will be rejected. Should almost identical or similar applications
be submitted by the same or different applicant organisations to the same or different Agencies, they will all be subject to a
specific assessment and may all be rejected.
All applications must contain original content authored by the applicant organisation. No other organisations or external
individuals can be paid for drafting the application.
NON-CUMULATIVE AWARD
Each project/activity financed by the EU is entitled to receive only one grant from the EU budget to any one beneficiary. In
no circumstances shall the same costs be financed twice by the Union budget.
64 Decision authorising the use of lump sums, unit costs and flat-rate financing for volunteering and solidarity projects actions
under the European Solidarity Corps: https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity/organisations/reference-documents-resources_en
65 Exceptionally and in accordance with the legal basis, costs may be eligible for financing if the have been incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant
application, if so indicated in the Financing Decision.
80Part E – Information for Applicants
To avoid the risk of double-funding, the applicant must indicate in the relevant section of the application form, the sources
and the amounts of any other funding received or applied for, whether for the same project or for any other project,
including operating grants.
NO-PROFIT
A grant financed from the Union budget must not have the purpose or effect of producing a profit within the framework of
the project carried out by the beneficiary. Profit is defined as surplus calculated at the payment of the balance, of receipts
over the eligible costs of the action or work programme, where receipts are limited to the Union grant and the revenue
generated by that action or work programme66. The no-profit principle does not apply to grants provided in the form of a
unit cost, a lump sum or a flat-rate financing, to actions implemented by non-profit organisations, neither to grant requests
that do not exceed EUR 60 000.
Where a profit is made, the Commission shall be entitled to recover the percentage of the profit corresponding to the Union
contribution to the eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary in carrying out the action or work programme.
For the purpose of calculating the profit generated by the grant, co-financing in the form of contributions in kind will not be
taken into account.
CO-FINANCING
An EU grant is an incentive to carry out a project which would not be feasible without the EU financial support, and is based
on the principle of co-financing. Co-financing implies that the EU grant may not finance the entire costs of the project; the
project must be funded by sources of co-financing other than the EU grant (e.g. beneficiary's own resources, income
generated by the action, financial contributions from third parties).
When the EU grant is provided in the form of a unit cost, a lump sum or a flat-rate financing - this is the case for most of the
Actions covered by this Guide - the principles of no-profit and co-funding are ensured by the Commission for the Action as a
whole in advance when it defines the rates or percentages of such units, lump sums and flat-rates. The respect of the no-
profit and co-financing principles is generally assumed and therefore, applicants do not have to provide information about
sources of funding other than the EU grant, nor they have to justify the costs incurred by the project.
However, the payment of the grant based on the reimbursement on the basis of contribution to unit costs, lump sums, or
flat-rate financing is without prejudice to the right of access to the beneficiaries’ statutory records. Where a check or audit
reveals that the generating event has not occurred (e.g. project activities not realised as approved at application stage,
participants not taking part in the activities, etc.) and an undue payment has been made to the beneficiary on a grant based
on the reimbursement on the basis of contribution to unit costs, lump sums, or flat-rate financing, the National Agency shall
be entitled to recover up to the amount of the grant. Similarly, if the activities undertaken or the outputs produced are of
insufficient quality, the grant may be reduced partly or in full even if the activities have taken place and are eligible.
In addition, for statistical and monitoring purposes the European Commission may carry out surveys on samples of
beneficiaries aimed at quantifying the actual costs incurred in projects funded based on the reimbursement on the basis of
contribution to unit costs, lump sums, or flat-rate financing.
SPECIFIC PROVISIONS APPLYING TO GRANTS PAID ON THE BASIS OF REIMBURSEMENT OF A SPECIFIED PORTION OF ELIGIBLE COSTS
When the EU grant is provided as a reimbursement of a specified portion of eligible costs, the following provisions apply67:
ELIGIBLE COSTS
An EU grant must not exceed an overall amount which is established by the National or Executive Agency at the time of the
project selection on the basis of the estimated eligible costs indicated in the application form. Eligible costs are costs
actually incurred by the beneficiary of a grant which meet all of the following criteria:
 they are incurred during the duration of the project, with the exception of costs relating to final reports and audit
certificates;
 they are indicated in the estimated overall budget of the project;
 they are necessary for the implementation of the project which is the subject of the grant;
 they are identifiable and verifiable, in particular being recorded in the accounting records of the beneficiary and
determined according to the applicable accounting standards of the country where the beneficiary is established
and according to the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary;
 they comply with the requirements of applicable tax and social legislation;
66 To this aim, the receipts are limited to income generated by the project. The profit (or the loss) as defined above is then the difference between:
the provisionally accepted amount of the grant and the income generated by the action, and the eligible costs incurred by the beneficiary.
In addition, whenever a profit is made, it will be recovered. The National Agency or Executive Agency are entitled to recover the percentage of the profit
corresponding to the Union contribution to the eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary to carry out the action. Further clarifications on the calcula-
tion of the profit will be provided for actions for which grants take the form of reimbursement of a specified proportion of eligible costs.
67 For actions managed by the Executive Agency, the detailed applicable financial provisions are presented in the Model Grant Agreement published in the
Funding and Tender Opportunity Portal.
81 they are reasonable, justified, and comply with the principle of sound financial management, in particular
regarding economy and efficiency;
 they are not covered through EU grants in the form of contribution to unit costs, lump sums or flat-rate financing.
The following categories of costs are also considered eligible:
 costs relating to a pre-financing guarantee lodged by the beneficiary of the grant, where that guarantee is
required by the National or Executive Agency;
 costs relating to certificates on the financial statements and operational verification reports where such
certificates or reports are required in support of the requests for payments by the National Agency;
 depreciation costs, provided they are actually incurred by the beneficiary.
The beneficiary's internal accounting and auditing procedures must permit direct reconciliation of the costs and revenue
declared in respect of the project with the corresponding accounting statements and supporting documents.
Value Added Tax (VAT)
Value added tax will be considered as an eligible cost only if it is not recoverable under the applicable national VAT
legislation68. The only exception relates to activities or transactions in which states, regional and local government
authorities and other public bodies engage as public authorities69. In addition:
 deductible VAT not actually deducted (due to national conditions or to the carelessness of beneficiaries) is not
eligible;
 the VAT Directive does not apply to nonEU- countries. Organisations from partner countries can be exempted
from taxes (including VAT), duties and charges, if an agreement has been signed between the European
Commission and the partner country where the organisation is established.
Eligible indirect costs
For certain types of activities (for details of the funding rules for Actions, please consult Part B and C of this Guide), a flat-
rate amount not exceeding 7 % of the eligible direct costs of the project (except volunteer costs, if any) is eligible under
indirect costs, representing the beneficiary's general administrative costs which are not already covered by the eligible
direct costs (e.g. electricity or Internet bills, cost for premises, etc.) but which can be regarded as chargeable to the project.
Indirect costs may not include costs entered under another budget category. Indirect costs are not eligible where the
beneficiary already receives an operating grant from the Union budget.
INELIGIBLE COSTS
The following costs shall not be considered eligible:
 return on capital and dividends paid by a beneficiary;
 debt and debt service charges;
 provisions for losses or debts;
 interest owed;
 doubtful debts;
 exchange losses;
 VAT, when it is considered as recoverable under the applicable national VAT legislation (see above paragraph on
Value Added Tax);
 costs declared by the beneficiary and covered by another project or work programme receiving an EU grant (see
also above paragraph on eligible indirect costs);
 excessive or reckless expenditure;
 contributions in kind from third parties;
 in the case of renting or leasing of equipment, the cost of any buy-out option at the end of the lease or rental
period;
 costs of opening and operating bank accounts (including costs of transfers from/to the National or Executive
Agency charged by the bank of the beneficiary).
SOURCES OF FINANCING
The applicant must indicate in the application form the contribution from sources other than the EU grant. External co-
financing may take the form of the beneficiary's own resources, financial contributions from third parties or income
generated by the project. If, at the time of the final report and request of payment of the balance, there is evidence that
there is a surplus of the income (see section on No-profit and Co-financing) over the eligible costs incurred by the project,
the National Agency or Executive Agency is entitled to recover the percentage of the profit corresponding to the Union
contribution to the eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary to carry out the project. This provision does not apply
to projects requesting a grant that does not exceed EUR 60 000.
Contributions in kind are not considered as a possible source of co-financing.
68 In the Member States the VAT national legislation translates the VAT Directive 2006/112/EC.
69 See article 13(1) of the Directive.

STEP 4: FILL IN AND SUBMIT THE APPLICATION FORM
To request an EU grant under the European Solidarity Corps, applicants must use the forms specific for each Action and
available on the websites of the European Commission, of the National Agencies or of the Executive Agency (please consult
the following link: https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity/contacts_en).
APPLICATION PROCEDURE
APPLICATION FORMS
Applicants are required to submit their application online to the appropriate National or Executive Agency using the correct
electronic form and including all requested annexes. Applications sent by post, courier service, fax or email will not be
accepted.
For actions managed by the National Agencies - The electronic forms can be accessed through
https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-esc and must be completed in one of the official languages used in programme
countries. For more information, consult the guidelines on how to fill in and submit an electronic form. These guidelines
also provide information on what to do in case of technical problems; a link to these guidelines is available in the electronic
forms. They are also available through the websites of the National Agencies.
For actions managed by the Executive Agency - Applications must be submitted electronically via the Funding & Tenders
Portal Electronic Submission System https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/home. For
more information about the submission process (including IT aspects), consult the Online Manual available at:
https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/om_en.pdf
In case of projects submitted in consortium, the coordinator submits a single application for the whole project on behalf of
all the members of the consortium.
The application must be submitted to the appropriate National or Executive Agency. In cases where the applicant has
submitted an application to other National Agency than the one in charge for the corresponding call for proposals, ths
National Agency shall re-direct the application to the correctNational Agency.
83RESPECT THE DEADLINE
The application must be submitted by the deadline set for each Action. The deadlines for the submission of projects are
specified for each Action in Parts B and C "Eligibility Criteria" of this Guide.
N.B.:
For actions managed by National Agencies, irrespective of the day of the deadline, the deadline for submission of
electronic forms is always set at 12:00:00 (midday Brussels time).
For actions managed by the Executive Agency and covered in this Guide, in line with the requirements of the
Commission’s Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP), irrespective of the day of the deadline, the deadline for
submission of proposals to the EACEA is 17:00:00 (Brussels time).
Applicants established in countries that have a different time zone should carefully consider the time differences to avoid
rejections.
WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE APPLICATION IS SUBMITTED?
All applications received by the National Agencies or by the Executive Agency undergo an evaluation procedure.
EVALUATION PROCEDURE
Project proposals are assessed exclusively on the basis of the criteria described in this Guide.
The National or the Executive Agency will:
 perform a check to verify that the admissibility, eligibility, exclusion and selection criteria are respected;
 evaluate the extent to which the participating organisations meet the award criteria (except in the case of grant
request under Volunteering Projects). Such quality assessment is in most cases carried out with the support of
independent experts. In their assessment, experts could be supported by guidelines developed by the European
Commission; where available, these guidelines will be made available on the websites of the European
Commission and of the Agencies responsible for the management of projects;
 verify that the proposal does not present risks of double funding. If necessary, such verification is carried out in
cooperation with other Agencies or other stakeholders.
The National or Executive Agency will appoint an evaluation committee to manage the whole selection process. On the
basis of the assessment carried out by the evaluation committee – if needed with the support of experts - will select and
establish a list of projects proposed for the grant award.
For all actions covered by this Guide, during the evaluation process, applicants may be asked to provide additional
information or to clarify the supporting documents submitted in connection with the application, provided that such
information or clarification does not substantially change the proposal. Additional information and clarifications are
particularly justified in case of obvious clerical errors made by the applicant, or in those cases where – for projects funded
through multi-beneficiary agreements – one or more mandates of the partners are missing (for multi-beneficiary
agreements, see section “grant agreement below”) .
FINAL DECISION
At the end of the evaluation procedure, the National or Executive Agency decides on the projects/amounts to be granted on
the basis of:
 the ranking list proposed by the evaluation committee (for Solidarity Projects and Volunteering Teams in High
Priority Areas);
 the budget available for any given Action.
After the completion of the selection procedure, the application files and accompanying material are not sent back to the
applicant, irrespective of the outcome of the procedure.
NOTIFICATION OF GRANT AWARD DECISIONS
The indicative calendar for the notification of selection results under each Action is indicated in the section "Project life-
cycle deadlines and payment modalities" below. All applicants will be informed about the evaluation result in the
notification letter on the outcome of the evaluation .
For Actions managed by the Executive Agency - Successful applications will be invited for grant preparation; other ones will
be put on the reserve list or rejected. Invitation to grant preparation does not constitute a formal commitment for funding.
Various legal checks before grant award will need to be performed: legal entity validation, financial capacity, exclusion
check, etc. At this time, applicants will be requested to submit their organisation’s financial data and appoint a LEAR. If an
84Part E – Information for Applicants
applicant believes that the evaluation procedure was flawed, he/she can submit a complaint (following the deadlines and
procedures set out in the notification letter on the outcome of the evaluation). Complaints submitted electronically may be
subject to character limitations. Notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending are considered to
have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from opening/access (see also Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and
Conditions).
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE APPLICATION IS APPROVED?
GRANT AGREEMENT
If the project is selected for an EU grant under the European Solidarity Corps, a grant agreement is signed between the
National or Executive Agency and the applicant. The applicant will receive the grant agreement, to be signed and returned
to the National or Executive Agency; the National or Executive Agency is the last party to sign. When the grant is signed by
both parties, the applicant becomes beneficiary of an EU grant and can start the project70. Depending on the type of Action,
grant agreements may take the form of mono-beneficiary agreements, with the applicant being the single beneficiary, or
multi-beneficiary agreements, where all partner organisations become beneficiaries of the agreement. The multi-
beneficiary agreement is signed by the coordinator which is the only contact point for the National or Executive Agency.
However, all other organisations participating in a project (co-beneficiaries) sign a mandate to confer to the coordinator the
responsibility of acting as main beneficiary. As a general rule, the mandates of each partner to the applicant should be
provided at application stage. If these mandates are provided at a later stage, they must be made available at the latest by
the time of the grant agreement signature.
Models of grant agreements used under the European Solidarity Corps will be made available in the course of the year on
the websites of the European Commission or National Agencies and for the Executive Agency through the Funding and
Tender Portal.
The indicative calendar for the receipt of grant agreements under each Action is indicated in the section "Project life-cycle
deadlines and payment modalities" below.
GRANT AMOUNT
The acceptance of an application does not constitute a commitment to award funding equal to the amount requested by
the applicant. The funding requested may be reduced on the basis of the specific financial rules applying to a given Action.
The award of a grant in a given round of selection does not establish an entitlement for subsequent rounds.
It should be noted that the grant amount foreseen by the agreement is a maximum which cannot be increased, even if the
beneficiary requests a higher amount.
Funds transferred by the National Agency or the Executive Agency must be identified within the account or sub-account
indicated by the beneficiary for the payment of the grant.
For Actions managed by the Executive Agency - Reporting and Payments arrangements presented in the Model Grant
Agreement published in the Funding and Tender Opportunity Portal apply.
PAYMENT PROCEDURES
Depending on the type of Action, duration of the grant agreement and the assessment of financial risk, projects/grant
requests supported under the European Solidarity Corps are subject to different payment procedures.
Except for the first pre-financing payment, other payments or recoveries will be made on the basis of the analysis of reports
or payment requests submitted by the beneficiary (the templates of these documents will be made available in the course
of the year on the websites of National Agencies or the Executive Agency).
The payment procedures applied under the European Solidarity Corps are described below.
PRE-FINANCING PAYMENT
A pre-financing payment will be transferred to the beneficiary within 30 days of the date when the last of the two parties
signs the grant agreement, and where relevant, any appropriate guarantees are received (see section "financial guarantee"
70 See footnote above
85below). Pre-financing is intended to provide the beneficiary with a float. National Agencies or the Executive Agency may
decide to split the first pre-financing payment into more instalments. They may also decide to reduce the pre-financing or
not pay any pre-financing at all, if the financial capacity of the beneficiary is weak.
FURTHER PRE-FINANCING PAYMENTS
Under some Actions, a second – and in some cases a third - pre-financing payment will be transferred to the beneficiary
within 30 calendar days of the receipt, by the National Agency or the Executive Agency, of the further pre-financing
payment requests advanced by the beneficiary or within 60 calendar days if the further pre-financing payment request is
accompanied by a progress report. These further pre-financing payments may be requested when at least 70 % of the
previous pre-financing payment has been used up. Where the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing
payment(s) shows that less than 70 % of the previous pre-financing payment(s) has been used to cover costs of the action,
the amount of the new pre-financing to be paid shall be reduced by the unused amounts of the previous pre-financing.
INTERIM (OR PROGRESS/TECHNICAL) REPORT
Under some Actions, beneficiaries will be asked to submit an interim as well as a progress/technical report informing on the
state of implementation of the activities and - in some cases - accompanying the request for a further pre-financing
payment. The interim and the progress/technical reports must be submitted by the deadline indicated in the grant
agreement.
NB: Organisations holding a Quality Label for lead organisations, at least once during the validity of the Quality Label, will be
required to:
 report on how they are progressing towards reaching their objectives;
 report on how they are ensuring the European Solidarity Corps principles and quality requirements;
 update their activity plan.
The National Agency may decide to request a progress report on the different elements listed above at the same time, or
separately. The National Agency may decide to replace the reporting requirements on objectives and quality standards with
a monitoring visit. Based on the organisation’s performance resulting from reporting, monitoring and quality assurance
checks, or as result of significant changes in the organisation, the National Agency may change the number and schedule of
progress reports. Organisations may voluntarily request to update their Quality Label. Based on the organisation’s
reasoning, the National Agency will decide whether an update is justified and acceptable.
PAYMENT OR RECOVERY OF THE BALANCE
The amount of the final payment to be made to the beneficiary will be established on the basis of a final report to be
submitted by the deadline indicated in the grant agreement. If a) the events generating the grant are not implemented or
are implemented in a different way than planned; or b) the eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary are lower than
those planned at application stage, or c) the quality of the realised activities/outputs is of insufficient quality, the funding
may be reduced proportionally or, where applicable, the beneficiary will be required to repay any excess amounts already
received as pre-financing payment.
Under some Actions, in justified cases the National Agency or the Executive Agency may transfer 100 % of the grant
awarded through the pre-financing instalments. In such cases a payment of the balance is not due. However, if - on the basis
of a final report to be submitted by the beneficiary by the deadline indicated in the grant agreement - a) the events
generating the grant are not implemented or are implemented in a different way than planned; or b) the eligible costs
actually incurred by the beneficiary are lower than those planned at application stage, or c) the quality of the realised
activities/outputs is of insufficient quality, the beneficiary will be required to repay any excess amounts already received as
pre-financing payment.
As a general rule, the final payment or request for recovery of the balance will be issued within 60 calendar days of the
receipt of the final report.
For more information, the detailed modalities of payment applying to each Action can be found in the section "Project life-
cycle deadlines and payment modalities" below.
86PROJECT LIFE-CYCLE DEADLINES AND PAYMENT MODALITIES
Please note that the indicative dates provided in the table below are given for general information only and do not constitute a legal obligation for the National Agencies or the Executive
Agency. Similarly as regards the payment modalities presented below, it should be noted that they will be applied in general, but depending on the individual situation of the applicant
organisation (e.g. depending on the financial capacity), different arrangements may be provided for in the grant agreement. In case of a shortage of EU appropriations for a given budget year,
the first pre-financing payment levels may be further reduced.

OTHER IMPORTANT CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS
FINANCIAL GUARANTEE
If the financial capacity is considered weak, the National Agency or the Executive Agency may require any beneficiary which
has been awarded a grant exceeding EUR 60 000 to lodge a guarantee in advance in order to limit the financial risks
connected with the pre-financing payment. This guarantee can be requested for up to the same amount of the pre-financing
payment(s).
The purpose of such guarantee is to make a bank or financial institution stand as irrevocable collateral security or first-call
guarantor of the beneficiary’s obligations deriving from the grant agreement.
This financial guarantee, in euro, shall be provided by an approved bank or financial institution established in an EU Member
State. When the beneficiary is established in a non-EU country, the National or Executive Agency may agree that a bank or
financial institution established in such country provides the guarantee, if it considers that the bank or financial institution
offers equivalent financial security and characteristics as those offered in an EU Member State.
The guarantee may be replaced by a joint third-party guarantee, or from several third-party guarantees from the
participating organisations who are parties to the same grant agreement.
The guarantee will be released after the pre-financing is gradually cleared against an interim payment or payment of the
balance to the beneficiary, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the grant agreement. In case the payment of the
balance takes the form of a recovery, either the guarantee will be released after the beneficiary is notified or will remain
explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the form of a recovery, until three months after the
debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
SUB-CONTRACTING AND AWARD OF A PROCUREMENT CONTRACT
The beneficiary may resort to subcontracting for specific technical services requiring specialised skills (relating to the legal,
accounting, tax, human resources fields, IT, etc.) or implementation contracts. The costs incurred by the beneficiary for this
type of services may therefore be considered as eligible costs provided they meet all the other criteria described in the
grant agreement.
Where implementation of the project requires the procurement of goods, works or services (implementation contract),
beneficiaries must award the contract to the economically most advantageous offer, i.e. the bid offering the best value for
money, or, as appropriate to the tender offering the lowest price, ensuring that there is no conflict of interests and that
documentation is retained in case of audit.
In the event of implementation contract exceeding a value of 60 000 EUR, the National or Executive agency may impose
special rules on the beneficiary, in addition to those referred to in the previous paragraph. Those special rules would be
published on the websites of the National Agencies or the Executive Agency.
INFORMATION ON THE GRANTS AWARDED
In line with the principle of transparency and the requirement for ex-post publicity, information on the recipients of the
Union funds must be published on the website of the Commission, the Executive Agency and/or the National Agencies
during the first half of the year following the closure of the financial year for which they were awarded.
The information may also be published in any other appropriate medium, including the Official Journal of the European
Union.
The National Agencies and the Executive Agency will publish the following information:
 name and locality of the beneficiary;
 amount of grant awarded;
 nature and purpose of the award.
Upon a reasoned and duly substantiated request by the beneficiary, the publication shall be waived if such disclosure risks
threatening the rights and freedoms of individuals concerned as protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union or harm the commercial interests of the beneficiaries.
As far as personal data referring to natural persons are concerned, the information published shall be removed two years
after the end of the financial year in which the funds were awarded. The same shall apply to personal data indicated in the
official titles of legal persons (e.g. an association or company having as title the names of their founders).
Beneficiary organisations are not authorised to publish this type of information in relation to young people participating in
European Solidarity Corps activities.
88PUBLICITY
Apart from the requirements regarding the visibility of the project/activities and for the dissemination and exploitation of its
results (which are award criteria), there is an obligation of minimal publicity for each granted project.
Beneficiaries must clearly acknowledge the European Union’s support in all communications or publications, in whatever
form or whatever medium, including the Internet, or on the occasion of activities for which the grant is used.
This must be done according to the provisions included in the grant agreement. If these provisions are not fully complied
with, the beneficiary’s grant may be reduced.
CHECKS AND AUDITS
The National or Executive Agency and/or the European Commission may carry out technical and financial checks and audits
in relation to the use of the grant. They may also check the statutory records of the beneficiary for the purpose of periodic
assessments of lump sum, unit cost or flat-rate financing. The beneficiary will undertake, with the signature of its legal
representative, to provide proof that the grant has been used correctly. The European Commission, the Executive Agency,
the National Agencies and/or the European Court of Auditors, or a body mandated by them, may check the use made of the
grant at any time up to five years, or for up to three years for grants not exceeding EUR 60 000, starting from the date of
payment of the balance or execution of the recovery by the National or Executive Agency. Therefore, beneficiaries shall keep
records, original supporting documents, statistical records and other documents connected with the grant during this
period.
The detailed provisions concerning checks and audits are described in the grant agreement.
DATA PROTECTION
Any personal data included in the application form or in the grant agreement/decision shall be processed by the National or
Executive Agency, or by the European Commission in accordance with:
 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data by the European Union institutions and bodies and on the free
movement of such data.
 In secondary order and only in so far as Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 does not apply – the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR or EU Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council) or the national data
protection legislation in case the GDPR does not apply (non-EU countries).
Unless marked as optional, the applicant's replies to the questions in the application form are necessary to evaluate and
further process the grant application in accordance with the European Solidarity Corps Guide. Personal data will be
processed solely for that purpose by the department or Unit responsible for the Union grant programme concerned (entity
acting as data controller). Personal data may be transferred on a need to know basis to third parties involved in the
evaluation of applications or in the grant management procedure, without prejudice of transfer to the bodies in charge of
monitoring and inspection tasks in accordance with European Union law or to bodies mandated to undertake evaluations of
the Programme or any of its Actions. In particular, for the purposes of safeguarding the financial interests of the Union,
personal data may be transferred to internal audit services, to the European Court of Auditors, to the Financial Irregularities
Panel or to the European Anti-Fraud Office and between authorising officers of the Commission and the executive agencies.
The applicant shall have the right of access to his/her personal data and the right to rectify any such data. Should the
applicant have any queries concerning the processing of his/her personal data, he/she shall address them to the Agency
that has selected the project. In case of conflicts; the applicant also has the right of recourse at any time to the European
Data Protection Supervisor. More information regarding the processing of personal data is included in the grant agreement.
Concerning the processing of personal data under the European Solidarity Corps, a detailed privacy statement, including
contact information, is available on the website of the Commission.
Within the framework of centralised actions managed by the Executive Agency, applicants - and, if they are legal entities,
persons who are members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of that applicant or who have powers of
representation, decision or control with regard to that applicant, or natural or legal persons that assume unlimited liability
for the debts of that applicant - are informed that, their personal data (name, given name if natural person, address, legal
form and name and given name of the persons with powers of representation, decision-making or control, if legal person)
may be registered in the Early Detection and Exclusion System (EDES) by the Authorising Officer of the Agency, should they
be in one of the situations mentioned in the Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union.
89European Solidarity Corps Guide
OPEN LICENCE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
An open licence is a way by which the owner of a work grants permission to everyone to use the resource. There are
different open licences according to the extent of the permissions granted or the limitations imposed and the beneficiaries
are free to choose the specific license to apply to their work. An open licence must be associated to each resource
produced.
An open licence is not a transfer of copyrights or Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Beneficiaries will remain the copyright
holders of the materials they produce and are allowed to use them as they wish. The only requirement for grant
beneficiaries is to make educational resources (or other documents and media produced by the project) freely accessible
through open licences. To fulfil this requirement, licenses need at least to grant use and, ideally, sharing and, adaptation
rights. Beneficiaries can also commercialise their project outcomes and experience shows that open access brings visibility
and may encourage interested users to buy the printed version or physical material, document or media.

takes place. It is strongly recommended that the authorisations are requested from the competent authorities well in
advance, since the process may take several weeks. National Agencies and the Executive Agency may give further advice and
support concerning visas, residence permits, social security, etc. The EU Immigration Portal contains general information on
visa and residence permits, for both short-term and long-term stays: https://ec.europa.eu/immigration/node_en.
