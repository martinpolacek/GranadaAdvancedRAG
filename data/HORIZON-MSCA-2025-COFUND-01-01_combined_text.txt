According to the Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protlecting EU classified information, “European Union
p
classified information (EUCI) means any information or material designated by an EU security classification, the unauthorised disclosure of which could cause varying
degrees of prejudice to the interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States”. m
3
Classified background information is information that is already classified by a country and/or internoational organisation and/or the EU and is going to be used by the
project. In this case, the project must have in advance the authorisation from the originator of the classified information, which is the entity (EU institution, EU Member
c
State, third state or international organisation) under whose authority the classified information has been generated.
4 EU classified foreground information is information (documents/deliverables/materials) plaenned to be generated by the project and that needs to be protected from
unauthorised disclosure. The originator of the EUCI generated by the project is the Europbean Commission.

EU Grants: Application form (HE MSCA COFUND): V3.1 – 17.10.2024
Instructions for Drafting Part B of the Proposal
Part B of the proposal contains the details of the proposed research and training programmes along
with the practical arrangements planned to implement them. They will be used by the independent
experts to undertake their assessment. We would therefore advise applicants to address each of the
award criteria as outlined in the relevant sections, using both descriptive text and the tables provided.
Please note that the explanatory notes included in the part B proposal template serve to explain the
award criteria without being exhaustive. To draft a proposal, applicants should also consult the current
version of the MSCA Work Programme.
Applicants must structure their proposal according to the headings indicated in the Part B proposal
template.
Please note that this call will be a single-stage proposal submission and evaluation procedure. An RTF
(rich text format) version of the submission template can be downloaded from the Electronic
Submission Service. Applicants must ensure that their proposals conform to this layout and to the
d
instructions given.
e
t
e
l
Note: For the 2025 call, applicants must submit Part B of thpeir proposal as two separate
documents: m
o
Document 1 (part B1): must comprise the Start Page, Tablec of Contents, the General Description of
the Programme/Information on the Beneficiary, and then Part B sections 1-3. The maximum total
e
length for this document is 34 pages. The Start Page must consist of 1 whole page. The General
b
Description of the Programme/Information on the Be neficiary must consist of a maximum of 2 pages.
o
The Table of Contents must consist of 1 whole page. If two whole pages are not used for this section,
t
the remaining space must be left blank: sectio n 1 must start on page 5 of the document. Of the
t
maximum 30 pages applied to sections 1, o2 and 3, applicants are free to decide on the allocation of
pages between the sections. However, thne overall page limit will be strictly applied and applicants
must keep the proposal within the lim its. The Expert evaluators will disregard any excess pages
,
e
above the 34 page limit, since all pages in excess will automatically be blanked out once the
l
application is submitted. p
m
Document 2 (part B2): must consist of Part B sections 4-6. No overall page limit will be applied to
a
this document, but appxlicants should respect the instructions given per section (e.g. in section 5, a
maximum of half a pEage per associated/implementing partner).
Note that applicants will not be able to submit their proposals in the submission system unless
both documents 1 and 2 are provided.
Size limit of the documents: Please note that the maximum size for each document is 10 MB. The
upload of any documents above this size limit will fail in the submission system. Applicants are
reminded to test the system in advance, and avoid submitting their proposal at the last minute.
The minimum font size allowed for the main text is 11 points. Standard character spacing and a
minimum of single line spacing has to be used. The page size is A4, and all margins (top, bottom, left,
right) should be at least 15 mm (not including any footers or headers). The reference font for the body
text of proposals is Times New Roman (Windows platforms), Times/Times New Roman (Apple
platforms) or Nimbus Roman No. 9 L (Linux distributions).
The use of a different font for the body text is not advised and is subject to the cumulative conditions
that the font is legible and that its use does not significantly shorten the representation of the proposal
in number of pages compared to using the reference font (for example with a view to bypass the page
Part B1 - Page 3 of 26Call: [insert call identifier] — [insert call name]
EU Grants: Application form (HE MSCA COFUND): V3.1 – 17.10.2024
limit). As an indication, such a layout should lead to a maximum of between 5,000 and 6,000 possible
characters per page (including spaces).
For the tables, the font size chosen must be clearly legible by the expert evaluators. The minimum font
size is therefore 9 points. Tables should not be used to circumvent the minimum font size indicated for
the main text. Literature references should be listed in footnotes, font size 8. All footnotes will
count towards the page limit.
Please note that the experts will be instructed to ignore hyperlinks to information that is specifically
designed to expand the proposal, thus circumventing the page limit.
Please make sure that both documents comprising Part B of the proposal carry as a header to each
page the proposal acronym and the implementation mode applied to (i.e. Doctoral or Postdoctoral).
All pages should also be numbered in a single series on the footer of the page to prevent errors
during handling. It is recommended to apply the following numbering format: "Part B - Page X of Y".
For both documents comprising Part B of the proposal, applicants must use exclusively PDF
(“Portable Document Format”, compatible with Adobe version 3 or higher, with embedded fonts).
Other file formats will not be accepted by the Electronic Submission Services of dthe Commission.

on specific activities or results, data management plans, ethics or security requirements).
Impacts Wider long term effects on society (including the environment), the economy and
science, enabled by the outcomes of R&I investments (long term). Impacts generally
occur some time after the end of the project.
Example: The deployment of the advanced forecasting system enables each airport to
increase maximum passenger capacity by 15% and passenger average throughput by
10%, leading to a 28% reduction in infrastructure expansion costs.
Milestone Control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to
the achievement of a key result, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may
d
also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective
e
measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where,
t
for example, the consortium must decide which of seveeral technologies to adopt for
further development. The achievement of a milestone sphlould be verifiable.
m
Objectives The goals of the work performed within the project, in terms of its research and
o
innovation content. This will be translated into the project’s results. These may range
c
from tackling specific research questions, demonstrating the feasibility of an innovation,
sharing knowledge among stakeholders oen specific issues. The nature of the objectives
b
will depend on the type of action, and the scope of the topic.
o
Outcomes The expected effects, over the medium term, of projects supported under a given topic.
t
The results of a project should contribute to these outcomes, fostered in particular by the
t
dissemination and
exploitao
tion measures. This may include the uptake, diffusion,
deployment, and/or use
n
of the project’s results by direct target groups. Outcomes
generally occur during, or shortly after the end of the project.
e
l
Example: 9 Eurpopean airports adopt the advanced forecasting system demonstrated
during the promject.
a
Pathway to Logical steps towards the achievement of the expected impacts of the project over time,
x
impact in paErticular beyond the duration of a project. A pathway begins with the projects’
results, to their dissemination, exploitation and communication, contributing to the
expected outcomes in the work programme, and ultimately to the wider scientific,
economic and societal impacts of the work programme destination.
Research Results generated by the action to which access can be given in the form of scientific
output publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such as software,
algorithms, protocols and electronic notebooks.
Results What is generated during the project implementation. This may include, for example,
know-how, innovative solutions, algorithms, proof of feasibility, new business models,
policy recommendations, guidelines, prototypes, demonstrators, databases and datasets,
trained researchers, new infrastructures, networks, etc. Most project results (inventions,
scientific works, etc.) are ‘Intellectual Property’, which may, if appropriate, be protected
by formal ‘Intellectual Property Rights’.
Example: Successful large-scale demonstrator: trial with 3 airports of an advanced
forecasting system for proactive airport passenger flow management.

Supervision d
e
Employers and/or funders should ensure that a person is clearly identified to whom researchers can
t
refer for the performance of their professional duties, and should inform thee researchers accordingly.
l
p
Such arrangements should clearly define that the proposed supervisors are sufficiently expert in
m
supervising research, have the time, knowledge, experience, expertise and commitment to be able to
offer the research doctoral candidate appropriate support and porovide for the necessary progress and
review procedures, as well as the necessary feedback mechancisms.
e
Supervision is one of the crucial elements of succebssful research. Guiding, supporting, directing,

In this section, please explain the impact of the research and training on the fellows' careers.
2.3 Suitability and quality of the measures to maximise expected outcomes and impacts, as
set out in the dissemination and exploitation plan, including communication activities
Required sub-headings:
• Plan for the dissemination and exploitation activities, including communication activities:
Describe the planned measures to maximise the impact of your project by providing a first version
of your ‘plan for the dissemination and exploitation including communication activities’.
Regarding communication measures and public engagement strategy, the aim is to inform and
reach out to society and show the activities performed, and the use and the benefits the project will
have for citizens. Activities must be strategically planned, with clear objectives, start at the outset
and continue through the lifetime of the project. The description of the communication activities
needs to state the main messages as well as the tools and channels that will be used to reach out to
each of the chosen target groups.
d
e
t
e
In case your proposal is selected for funding, a more detailed plan will need to be provided as a
l
mandatory project deliverable submitted at mid-term stage with an pupdate towards the end of the
project. m
o
• Strategy for the management of intellectual propertcy, foreseen protection measures, such as
patents, design rights, copyright, trade secrets, etc ., and how these would be used to support
e
exploitation. b
o
If your project is selected, we encourage you to have a consortium agreement to manage (amongst
t
other things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, research data etc.). Where relevant,
t
o
these will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities arising from the
n
project.
,
e
All measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, and should contain concrete
l
p
actions to be implemented both during and after the end of the project, e.g. standardisation activities.
m
Your plan should give due consideration to the possible follow-up of your project, once it is finished.
In the justification, explaain why each measure chosen is best suited to reach the target group
addressed. Where relexvant, describe the measures for a plausible path to commercialise the
E
innovations.
Concrete plans for sections 2.3 must be included in the corresponding implementation tables.
Note that the following sections of the European Charter for Researchers refer specifically to
public engagement and dissemination:
Dissemination, Exploitation of Results #@COM-DIS-VIS-CDV@#
All researchers should ensure, in compliance with their contractual arrangements, that the results of
their research are disseminated and exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research
settings or, if appropriate, commercialised. Senior researchers, in particular, are expected to take a lead
in ensuring that research is fruitful and that results are either exploited commercially or made
accessible to the public (or both) whenever the opportunity arises.
Public Engagement
Researchers should ensure that their research activities are made known to society at large in such a
way that they can be understood by non-specialists, thereby improving the public's understanding of
Part B1 - Page 15 of 26Call: [insert call identifier] — [insert call name]
EU Grants: Application form (HE MSCA COFUND): V3.1 – 17.10.2024
science. Direct engagement with the public will help researchers to better understand public interest in
priorities for science and technology and also the public's concerns.

4. Ethics
Actions carried out under Horizon Europe shall comply with ethical principles and relevant
Union, national and international law, including the Charter and the European Convention for
the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its Supplementary Protocols.
Particular attention shall be paid to the principle of proportionality, to the right to privacy, the right to
the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of a person, the right to
non-discrimination and to the need to ensure protection of the environment and high levels of human
health protection.
Ethics is important for all research domains. Informed consent and confidentiality are as important for
a sociological study as they are for clinical research.
In this context, please be aware that it is the applicants’ responsibility to identify any potential ethics
issues, to handle the ethics aspects of their proposal, and to detail how they plan tdo address them.
e
t
Please describe in this section the ethics procedure to be implemented. Foer COFUND programmes, it
is often not known in advance if the fellowships to be funded will raisle ethics issues. Therefore, it is
p
important to describe how the proposal meets the European as well as the national legal and ethics
m
requirements of the country or countries where the tasks raising ethics issues are to be carried out. In
particular, applicants should take care to describe the ethics proocedures that they will enforce in the
c
execution of the programme (at application phase, selection and evaluation phase, monitoring and
follow-up of projects, and the trainings on ethics). Succeessful COFUND programmes, when opening
their calls for proposals, will have to detail the procbedure to be followed for addressing proposals
raising ethics issues.

8 MSCA Green Charter https://ec.europa.eu/msca/green_charter
The MSCA Green Charter constitutes a code of good practice for all recipients of MSCA funding – both
individuals and institutions – and promotes the mainstreaming of environmental considerations in all aspects of
project implementation. In so doing, the Charter seeks to reduce the environmental footprint of MSCA-funded
projects, to raise awareness of environmental sustainability, and to serve as a catalyst in promoting best practice
in sustainable research management.

5EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
IMPORTANT NOTICE
The AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement is a user guide that aims to explain to applicants and
beneficiaries the EU Model Grant Agreements for the EU funding programmes 2021-2027.
Programme specificities are reflected in this document as examples — in so far as they are accepted
as mainstream solutions that can be used by several EU programmes.
The purpose of this document is to help users understand and interpret their Grant Agreements
(GAs). By avoiding technical vocabulary, legal references and jargon, it seeks to help readers find
answers to the practical questions they may come across when setting-up or implementing their
projects.
In the same spirit, the document’s structure mirrors that of the EU Model Grant Agreements (MGAs).
It explains each MGA Article and includes examples where appropriate.
Since all EU MGAs are derived from the same basic model (EU General Model Grant Agreement), the
AGA focuses mainly on this model. Other types of grants will be gradually covered by separate
guidance, in order to be able to cover all specificities, not only the specific explanations on the
contractual text.
Our approach
1. The text of the article appears in a grey text box — to differentiate it from the annotations.
The concepts that are annotated are in bold and underlined.
The annotations to the article are immediately underneath.
Long articles are split into different parts, so the annotations can be placed below the
relevant parts.
Examples are in green.
Lists are in red.
Specific cases and exceptions are in orange.
Programme-specific cases are in purple.
New explanations (compared to the last AGA update) will be marked with: (as from V1.0;
not applicable for the draft versions)
New rules that do not apply to all signed Grant Agreements (but instead only to those signed
after a certain version, e.g. version 3.0), will be marked with: and
2. As the AGA intends to be comprehensive, it will cover all possible options envisaged in the
EU MGAs.
Many of these options may not be relevant to your grant (and will not appear in the Grant
Agreement you sign, or will be marked ‘not applicable’). The chosen options will be
summarised in the Data Sheet of your Grant Agreement.
Versioning
The AGA will be managed as a stable corporate document with versions. Older versions will be
accessible through hyperlinks in the History of Changes table.
Other information
The AGA is limited to the provisions of the EU Model Grant Agreements. For a more general
overview of how EU grants work, see the Online Manual and the programme-specific guidance
published in the Funding & Tenders Portal Reference Documents.
The Portal Reference Documents also contain a comprehensive list of all other reference documents,
for each EU programme (including legislation, work programme and templates).
Terms are explained in the Funding & Tenders Portal Glossary.

I. EU GENERAL MODEL GRANT AGREEMENT (GENERAL
MGA)
INTRODUCTION
General > EU grants regulatory framework
1. EU Regulatory framework for funding programmes — EU Financial Regulation —
EU Programme Regulations — EU grant agreements
EU grants are given through sui generis private law contractual arrangements called ‘EU
grant agreements’.
They govern the relationship between the EU granting authorities and the
beneficiaries/participants in EU grants and set out the respective rules and obligations
concerning the funding and the implementation and of the EU projects.
The grant agreements are embedded in the EU regulatory framework, i.e. EU Financial
Regulation and the sectoral regulations setting up the funding programmes (‘basic acts’ or
‘programme regulations’).
The EU Financial Regulation codifies the procedures for awarding EU funding; the sectoral
regulations contain additional, programme-specific rules on the objectives of each programme,
eligibility, selection procedures, etc.
In September 2024, the Financial Regulation 2018/1046 was recast and replaced by the
Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
The new Regulation 2024/2509 applies to all EU calls for proposals opening as from 30
September 2024.
In addition, the EU grant agreements have been updated and will be used as from mid 2025.
The update has however very limited impact (mainly cross-references to the Financial
Regulation that had to be replaced and a clarification regarding the failure to cooperate with
checks, reviews, audits and investigations as a breach of contract in Articles 28, 30, 31 and 32
of the grant agreements — which was in substance already covered by these provisions also
before the update).
The MGA and AGA have been updated to the new numbering. For your convenience, new
footnotes have been added with references to the old Financial Regulation.
General > Scope – Types of actions – Types of grant agreements?
2. Background and scope — What types of actions are funded by EU grants —
Types of grant agreements
The EU uses different types of grants in its funding programmes (‘programmes’). The EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509 distinguishes between 2 main types: action grants (AG) and
operating grants (OG)1.
In addition, there are simplified grant types which pay only lump sums (LS) or unit costs
(UN)2.
1 See Article 183(2) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23
September 2024 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union (recast) (‘EU Financial
Regulation’) (OJ L, 2024/2509, 26.9.2024) [old Financial Regulation: Article 180(2) Regulation (EU, Euratom)
2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the
general budget of the Union (‘EU Financial Regulation’) (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1).]
10EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Grants are usually given through open calls for proposals, but may sometimes also be
awarded directly without a call. They can be multi- or mono-beneficiary actions.
The General Model Grant Agreement (General MGA) is the grant agreement for EU action
grants (AG), i.e. grants that are funded based on the actual costs incurred by the
beneficiaries.
For guidance on other types of grants, see How to manage your lump sum grants.
This new General MGA has been introduced by the European Commission for the new
generation of programmes under the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027
(new for 2021-2027), in order to ensure simpler and more coherent provisions for all EU
programmes. Programme-specific provisions are grouped in Article 6 and Annex 5; the rest of
the provisions are the same for all programmes.
The new AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement reflects this new structure. Moreover, since a
wide range of programmes is now using the European Commission eGrants IT tools (EU
Funding & Tenders Portal; also called ‘Portal’), the annotations focus on grants managed
through these IT tools. For other aspects, the AGA applies to grant agreements managed
outside these tools (paper).
General > How to set up your project — Consortium composition and roles and responsibilities
3. How to set up your project — Consortium composition and roles and
responsibilities
Capacity to successfully carry out the project:
The Financial Regulation requires that beneficiaries must have the technical and financial
resources needed to carry out their projects (‘operational and financial capacity’)3.
This assessment is project-specific (and the outcome may accordingly vary between calls,
depending on the complexity and nature of the action). What will be checked is if the
participants have sufficient operational and financial capacity to carry out the proposed
action.
The sufficient capacity must be demonstrated in the proposal and be available at the moment
of the implementation of the work (i.e. not necessarily already at the moment of submitting
the proposal or signing the GA, but at least when the work starts). In order to give sufficient
assurance, proposals should show how the resources will be made available when they are
needed.
Examples (acceptable):
1. For an innovative technology call, a Start-up company with no resources at the time of proposal
submission, but with a credible business plan described in the application.
2. SME which, if it gets the grant, plans to double its capacity/staff.
Examples (not acceptable):
1. Consultancy company which submits a proposal where the majority of the work is
subcontracted.
2 See Article 183(3) and 125 Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 180(3) and 125
Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
3 See Article 201 Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 198 Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
11EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. For a call for distribution of support goods in an immediate crisis situation, a start-up with no
experience and no resources at the time of proposal submission.
Different roles in the GA:
Ideally, the project work should be done by the beneficiaries and their affiliated entities
themselves, but if needed, they may involve other partners and rely on outside resources
(purchase new equipment, goods, works or services, subcontract a part of the work or
involve associated partners, etc).
Legally speaking, it is the beneficiaries that remain fully responsible towards the granting
authority (since they are the ones that have signed the Grant Agreement (GA)). For all the other
participants, the obligations under the Grant Agreement are indirect, meaning that the
beneficiaries must ensure that the activities of the other participants are in line with the Grant
Agreement. In case of non-compliance, the granting authority will turn to the beneficiaries to
enforce their obligations.
Depending on the programme and on the type of action, entities can participate in various
roles: as coordinator, beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, in-kind
contributors, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP).
Each role is linked to a set of conditions and legal rights and obligations that are relatively rigid.
Make sure that you chose the appropriate role for everyone. Having the wrong role can cause a
lot of problems later on.
Coordinator vs other beneficiaries
The coordinator is the participant that will be the central contact point (for the granting
authority) and represent the consortium (towards the granting authority). The other
beneficiaries are the other entities that participate as beneficiaries (i.e. also sign the grant).
For mono-beneficiary grants, the mono-beneficiary also has the coordinator role.
Beneficiaries vs affiliated entities
Affiliated entities (new for 2021-2027; in some programmes previously called ‘linked third
parties’) are in practice treated largely like beneficiaries (except that — formally speaking —
they do NOT sign the Grant Agreement).
They must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding as the beneficiaries and
need to have a validated participant identification code (PIC) in the Portal Participant
Register. Annotations in this AGA which refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to affiliated
entities (just like the provisions of the MGA themselves; see also MGA Preamble).
More details on participant registration and PICs are explained in the Online Manual >
Participant Register > Registration and validation of your organisation on the Funding & Tenders
Portal.
Su bcontractors vs suppliers of goods, works and services
The core criterium for distinguishing between subcontracts and contracts/purchases is
whether they concern action tasks as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of
the Grant Agreement).
Subcontracts Purchases
Subcontracts concern the implementation Purchases concern any other contracting

services) that are necessary for the
beneficiaries to implement the work (can
range from big equipment to petty goods)
but do not constitute by themselves an
action task described in Annex 1.
The price for the subcontracts will be The price for these contracts will be
declared as ‘Subcontracting costs’ in the declared in one of the ‘Purchase costs’

Example (subcontracts): Subcontract to organise a conference that is set as part of the
tasks in Annex 1.
Example (purchases): Contract for an audit certificate on the financial statements; contract
for the translation of documents; contract for the publication of brochures; contract for the
creation of a website that enables the beneficiaries to work together (if creating the website is
just a project management tool and not a separate subcontracted ‘action task’); contract for
organisation of the rooms and catering for a meeting (if the organisation of the meeting is not
a separate subcontracted ‘action task’); contract for hiring IPR consultants/agents needed for
the project.
The same kind of items (e.g. writing materials) can qualify as purchases in one action
(simple consumables for the implementation of the action), but as subcontracting in another
(e.g. if it is an action task to acquire writing materials for a school).
Subcontractors and purchases vs affiliated entities
In contrast to subcontractors, affiliated entities have a link (e.g. legal or capital) with a
beneficiary which goes beyond the implementation of the action.
Subcontracts and purchases Affiliated entities

The eligible cost is the price charged to the The eligible costs are only the costs of the
beneficiary (usually containing a profit affiliated entity, no profit is allowed (neither
margin for the supplier or subcontractors, for the affiliated entity, nor for the

The beneficiary must award the contracts
and subcontracts on the basis of best value
for money (or lowest price) and absence of
conflict of interests.
Example (implementation by affiliated entity): Company X and company Y do not control
each other, but they are both fully owned by company Z. Company X is beneficiary in the grant
and company Y implements some of the action tasks described in Annex 1(testing and analysis
of the resistance of a new component under high temperatures).
Contributions against payment vs in-kind contributions (for free)
13EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In some projects, third parties make available some of their resources to a beneficiary
without this being part of their normal economic activity (i.e. seconding personnel,
contributing equipment, infrastructure or other assets, or other goods and services).
This can be done against payment or for free. If against payment, the costs paid can be
charged by the beneficiaries to the action (e.g. A.3 Seconded persons, C.2 Equipment and
C.3 Other goods, works and services); if for free, there are no costs that arise for the
beneficiaries, so nothing can be charged to the action (exception for HE: in-kind contributions
for free can under certain conditions be declared as eligible costs, see Article 6.1).
Example (in-kind contributions (for free)): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university. His salary is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but by the government (the
ministry). According to the secondment agreement, the government does not ask any
reimbursement in exchange (non-cash donation). Since the beneficiary does not incur any
costs, nothing can be charged to the grant. (exception for HE: the beneficiary can declare the
salary costs in its financial statements, even if they are paid by the ministry/government).
Example (contributions against payment): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university. His salary is paid by the government (the ministry) which employs him. According
to the secondment agreement, the beneficiary (the university) has to reimburse the
government an amount corresponding to the paid salary. The reimbursed amount is a cost for
the beneficiary and is recorded as such in its accounts. The beneficiary will declare the amount
reimbursed to the government in its financial statements.
Associated partners vs affiliated entities and third parties giving in-kind contributions
A new type of participant has been introduced (new for 2021-2027), the so-called associated
partners. They may implement action tasks, but in contrast to affiliated entities they do not
need to have a capital or legal link to a beneficiary and cost incurred by associated partners
can NOT be declared as eligible cost. In contrast to third parties giving in-kind contributions,
the associated partners are fully named in the Grant Agreement and may implement
important action tasks by themselves.
Entities that do not request funding or are not eligible for funding may participate in EU
actions as associated partners, for example out of interest in contributing to the objectives of
the action, gaining visibility, or participating due to ongoing (R&D) cooperation with a
beneficiary.
As with any other participant that does not sign the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries need
to ensure (e.g. through the consortium agreement) that associated partners implement their
action tasks in accordance with the Grant Agreement.
Where possible, associated partners should be linked to a specific beneficiary.
Combination of roles
In principle, each person or entity should only participate in a single role in an action. This is
to avoid any potential conflicts of interest and ensure clear allocation of rights and obligations
as well as certainty on cost eligibility.
A combination of roles within the same action is only possible in the following very limited
cases provided it is not used in a way to circumvent rules of the Grant Agreement:
- Associated partner + third party giving in-kind contribution: If necessary for
the implementation of the action, associated partners implementing their own tasks
may also support beneficiaries and affiliated entities in the implementation of their
tasks by providing in-kind contributions.
- Associated partner/third party giving in-kind contribution/ + subcontractor:
It is in principle possible for an associated partner or a third party giving in-kind
contributions in support of certain parts of the action to also compete for subcontracts
for other parts of the same action. If, in accordance with the criteria for awarding
14EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
subcontracts (best value for money or lowest price, no conflict of interest), an
associated partner or a third party already giving in-kind contributions gives the best
offer, it may also participate as a subcontractor.
- Recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) + any other role:
Recipients of financial support to third parties must normally be third parties to the
agreement. Beneficiaries are not allowed to provide financial support under the Grant
Agreement to themselves or their affiliated entities. However, certain exceptions may
be made if explicitly allowed in the call conditions/Grant Agreement and justified in
the DoA Annex 1 (e.g. for HE Co-funded Partnerships, see Annex 5 > HE Co-funded
Partnerships). By contrast, in the case of third parties providing in-kind contributions
or subcontractors, assuming that the financial support is not directly related to their
tasks, they are considered third parties to the agreement and may therefore in
principle receive financial support to third parties under the conditions set out in the
Grant Agreement.

If only one beneficiary signs the Grant Agreement (‘mono-beneficiary grant’), all provisions referring to the
‘coordinator’ or the ‘beneficiaries’ will be considered — mutatis mutandis — as referring to the beneficiary.
The parties referred to above have agreed to enter into the Agreement.
By signing the Agreement and the accession forms, the beneficiaries accept the grant and agree to implement
the action under their own responsibility and in accordance with the Agreement, with all the obligations and
terms and conditions it sets out.
The Agreement is composed of:

1. Consortium: Coordinator — Beneficiaries — Affiliated entities — Other
participants
In EU grants, the consortium is normally composed of the key project participants, i.e.
typically the coordinator and the other beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated
partners. Sometimes also subcontractors and third parties that contribute to the action are
included.
The coordinator is the beneficiary which is the central contact point for the granting
authority and represents the consortium (towards the granting authority). For mono-
beneficiary grants, the mono-beneficiary also has the coordinator role.
The signature arrangements are the following:
− the coordinator directly signs the Grant Agreement
− the other beneficiaries sign the Grant Agreement by signing the Accession Form (see
Article 40). Only beneficiaries sign the Accession Form. Affiliated entities, associated
partners etc. do NOT sign the Accession Form.
Amendments to the GA, if any, will be signed by the coordinator on behalf of the other
beneficiaries.
The division of roles and responsibilities within the consortium are explained in Article 7.
Generally speaking:
− the coordinator must coordinate and manage the grant, including distribution of
payments received from the granting authority, and is the central contact point for the
granting authority
− the beneficiaries must collectively together contribute to a smooth and successful
implementation of the project (i.e. implement their part of the action properly, comply
with their own obligations under the Grant Agreement and support the coordinator in
his obligations).
The beneficiaries are bound by the grant terms and conditions. This means that they must:
18EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− carry out the action as described in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of the
Grant Agreement) and
− comply with all the other provisions of the Grant Agreement and all the applicable
provisions of EU, international and national law (including general principles, such as
fundamental rights, values, and ethical principles).
The involvement of other participants which do not sign the Grant Agreement (affiliated
entities, associated partners, subcontractors, etc) varies depending on the role. Since there is
no formal contractual link with them, their obligations will always be enforced through the
responsible beneficiaries.
The consortium set-up must follow the roles in the Grant Agreement.
Participants should be attributed their roles according to their real contribution to the project.
The main actors should be the beneficiaries or affiliated entities. All other roles should be
complementary.
This means for instance:
− affiliated entities — are allowed to fully participate in the action; they are treated like
beneficiaries for most issues (including cost eligibility); they do not however have
access to the Portal My Area section (see Article 36); annotations in this AGA which
refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to affiliated entities (just like the provisions of
the MGA themselves; see also MGA Preamble)
− subcontracting — beneficiaries/affiliated entities may NOT subcontract tasks to other
beneficiaries/affiliated entities
− coordinator tasks — the coordinator tasks listed in the Grant Agreement may NOT be
subcontracted (they can only be delegated, under certain circumstances, to an entity
with ‘authorisation to administer’ or in the case of ‘sole beneficiaries’ within the
meaning of Article 190(2) of the Financial Regulation 2024/25094; see Article 7).
For an overview on the different types of third parties and their roles, rights and obligations
under the Grant Agreement, see the table in Article 7.
If you are an assocation with members who will implement some of the action activities (or an
European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) or joint venture), you should make sure that the
members participate as affiliated entities, so that they will be able to charge their costs to the
project. Otherwise these costs will NOT be eligible.
2. Name and address — Legal entity data
The legal entity data (legal name, address, legal representatives, etc) of the beneficiaries
comes from the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register (former ‘Beneficiary Register’).
This data will be automatically used for all communications concerning the grant (see Article
36) and will also be used in case you are applying for other EU grants, prizes or tenders (if
managed through the Portal).
The beneficiaries (via their legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)) must keep their data in
the Participant Register up-to-date at all times including after the end of the grant (see Article
19).

1 If the RAO decides to set specific rules, they must be set out in the call and take into account the value of the contracts and the relative size
of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk (proportionality). Specific rules may only be set for the award of
contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000.
2 This is a standard obligation for all EU grants. It may be unselected only for actions where subcontracting is a key/large part of the action
(e.g infrastructure projects; technical assistance, statistical programmes, etc).

1. Data Sheet
The Data Sheet shows ALL options in the Grant Agreement (i.e. all provisions in the terms
and conditions that are flagged as options — marked by red or green brackets).
The Data Sheet uses the IT labels that are used by the Portal Grant Management System for
the automatic generation of the contracts.
These labels do NOT necessarily reflect the precise legal provisions and must therefore ALWAYS
be cross-checked with the full text of the corresponding provision in the terms and conditions
Examples:
1. The options ‘Actual costs/Unit or actual cost’ for travel and subsistence in the Data Sheet are linked to the
corresponding Options in Article 6.2.C.1. Thus, ‘Unit or actual costs’ does NOT mean that the beneficiaries
can freely choose which cost form to use. The cost form to be used is prescribed by the conditions in Article
6.2.C.1.
2. The options ‘Yes/No’ for VAT in the Data Sheet are linked to the Options in Article 6.3(viii). Thus, ‘Yes’
means eligible under the conditions set out in that provision (Article 6.3(viii)); ‘No’ means always ineligible.
Red options are options which have been selected at programme- or type of action-level.
Green options are options that are selected either at call- or project-level.

ARTICLE 1 — SUBJECT OF THE AGREEMENT
This Agreement sets out the rights and obligations and terms and conditions applicable to the grant awarded
[OPTION for SGAs: under Framework Partnership Agreement No [insert number] — [insert acronym]] for
the implementation of the action set out in Chapter 2.
1. Subject of the Grant Agreement
The Grant Agreement sets out the rights and obligations of each party and the terms and
conditions of the grant that beneficiaries must comply with when implementing the action
(i.e. the project).
Grants are public funding in form of donation (i.e. a free, non-reimbursable contribution). The
EU donates to actions because it is a way to incentivise activities that are in the public policy
interest. It is a positive way to support and involve citizens and encourage broad cooperation
across borders without taking ownership in the action.
The granting authority is NOT procuring your work, goods or services, nor is your project
‘done for the European Commission’ or any other EU granting authority.

CHAPTER 2 ACTION
General > Article 3 — Action
ARTICLE 3 — ACTION
ARTICLE 3 — ACTION
The grant is awarded for the action [insert project number] — [insert acronym] (‘action’), as described in
Annex 1.
[OPTION for programmes with linked actions: [OPTION if selected for the grant16: This action is linked to
the action(s) set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 1) (‘linked actions’).]]
16 Linked actions cover all types of joint/combined/coordinated actions, where the action implementation should be linked to another action
(e.g. Horizon complementary grants, Horizon joint actions; Horizon MSCA SNLS grants, EDIDP COFUND, JU implementing grants,
etc.).
1. Actions
The grant is awarded to allow the consortium to implement the action as described in the
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement (i.e. the project).
Depending on the EU programme under which the grant is awarded, your action may belong
to a specific type of action that is mentioned in the call conditions (e.g. Project Grants, Lump
Sum Grants, Infrastructure Grants, Grants for Procurement, Coordination and Support
Actions, etc).
2. Linked actions
Linked actions are used when the granting authority wishes to establish a formal link between
your action and other activities, that may for example complement, precede or succeed your
project.
The linked action is identified in the Grant Agreement (see Data Sheet, Point 1) and may
refer to any formally set-up activity, such as other EU grants, but also grants from EU
Member States or international organisations, blended finance, or activities carried out under
procurement contracts, etc.
The beneficiaries of both actions must have arrangements, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly. If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet,
Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written collaboration agreement (or, if the
consortia are identical, as part of their consortium agreement; see Article 7).
Specific cases (linked actions):
EU Synergy actions — When projects are part of EU ‘Synergy calls’ (i.e. jointly coordinated
calls that pursue common policy objectives and allow for the combination of funding), they
will always be flagged as ‘Synergy actions’ and benefit from the special cost eligibility rules in
Article 6.3. Other actions (not part of a ‘Synergy call’) can be flagged by the granting
authority as ‘Synergy action’ on request. This is typically needed if an action should benefit
from different combined EU grants. In this case, the beneficiaries must inform both granting
authorities so that they can take measures to prevent double funding. For details, see Article
6.3.
32EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 4 — Duration and starting date
ARTICLE 4 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE
ARTICLE 4 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE
The duration and the starting date of the action are set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 1).
1. Action starting date
The action starting date is fixed in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement.
It is usually the first day of the month following the grant signature. But the parties can also
agree to a fixed starting date (if justified during grant preparation, e.g. conference that must
take place on a specific date).
The fixed starting date should normally be in the future (after grant signature) but it is
possible to propose an earlier starting date (retroactive).
Be however aware that by starting the action before signing the GA, you risk that the starting
date will not be accepted by the granting authority (which will assess the compliance with
applicable rules) or that the grant will not be signed, and no costs will be eligible (e.g. for
activities implemented before signature of the grant). Conversely, starting dates far in the
future affect normally also the timing of your (first) pre-financing payment.
The action starting date can normally NOT be before the submission of the proposal —
unless the Programme Regulation (basic act) allows this or in cases of emergency, e.g. for
humanitarian aid and civil protection, for urgencies in the veterinary or phytosanitary domain, etc.
The starting date will also affect the eligibility of costs (see Article 6.1(a)(ii)).
2. Action duration
The action duration is fixed in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement.
It usually comes from your proposal (based on the call conditions) and is expressed as a
number of months, running from the action starting date.
The action end date shown in the system is the date that is automatically calculated from the
starting date (starting date + months of duration).
The action duration relates only to the period during which the action tasks (set out in Annex 1)
are implemented. This is NOT the same as project closure (i.e. final payment) or the end of the
Grant Agreement. After the action end date, the beneficiaries still have to submit their final report
and the granting authority will have to make the payment of the balance. Moreover, certain
obligations under the Grant Agreement continue even afterwards (e.g. keeping supporting
documents in case of audits, continue to use certain equipment for the same objective, maintain
the website of the project if required, etc).

CHAPTER 3 GRANT
General > Article 5 — Grant
ARTICLE 5 — GRANT
ARTICLE 5 — GRANT
5.1 Form of grant
The grant is an action grant17 which takes the form of a [budget-based][activity-based] mixed actual cost
grant (i.e. a grant based on actual costs incurred, but which may also include other forms of funding, such as
unit costs or contributions, flat-rate costs or contributions, lump sum costs or contributions or financing not
linked to costs).
5.2 Maximum grant amount
The maximum grant amount is set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 3) and in the estimated budget (Annex 2).
[OPTION for programmes with contingency reserve: [OPTION if selected for the call: The maximum grant
amount can be raised at the end of the action, by activating the contingency reserve set out in the Data Sheet
(see Point 3).]]
5.3 Funding rate
[OPTION 1 for programmes with single funding rate (per action): The funding rate for costs is […]% of the
action’s eligible costs. Contributions are not subject to any funding rate.]
5.4 Estimated budget, budget categories and forms of funding
The estimated budget for the action is set out in Annex 2.
It contains the estimated eligible costs and contributions for the action, broken down by participant [OPTION
for programmes with activity-based budget:, type of activity] and budget category.
Annex 2 also shows the types of costs and contributions (forms of funding)19 to be used for each budget
category.
If unit costs or contributions are used, the details on the calculation will be explained in Annex 2a.
5.5 Budget flexibility
The budget breakdown may be adjusted — without an amendment (see Article 39) — by transfers (between
participants and budget categories), as long as this does not imply any substantive or important change to the
description of the action in Annex 1.
However:
- changes to the budget category for volunteers (if used) always require an amendment
- changes to budget categories with lump sums costs or contributions (if used; including financing not
linked to costs) always require an amendment
- changes to budget categories with higher funding rates or budget ceilings (if used) always require an
amendment
- addition of amounts for subcontracts not provided for in Annex 1 either require an amendment or
simplified approval in accordance with Article 6.2
- other changes require an amendment or simplified approval, if specifically provided for in Article
6.2
- [OPTION 1 by default: flexibility caps: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes with flexibility
caps: [OPTION 1 by default: flexibility caps: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the call:
flexibility caps: [transfers between budget categories of more than [20%][[…%]] [of the total costs
and contributions][per budget category] set out in Annex 2 require an amendment][[other]]]] .
17 For the definition, see Article 183(2)(a) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: ‘action grant’ means an EU grant to finance “an action
intended to help achieve a Union policy objective”.
19 See Article 125 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
34EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Form of grant
EU grants are normally ‘budget-based mixed actual cost’ grants (meaning grants, broken
down by budget categories and participants, and based on actual costs incurred and other
simplified forms of funding (e.g. normally unit costs for SME owners/natural person
beneficiaries and volunteers, if applicable and flat rate costs for indirect costs).
However, depending on the programme and on the type of action, grants may also be:
− pure actual cost grants (e.g. some operating grants)
− pure lump sum grants
− pure unit grants
− ‘activity-based mixed actual cost’ grants, i.e. broken down by budget categories as
well as by activities
or
− any other combination of costs and/or contributions.
For guidance on other types of grants, see How to manage your lump sum grants.
Ge neral > Article 5.2 Maximum grant amount
2. Maximum grant amount
The maximum grant amount set out in this Article defines the maximum amount of funding
that the granting authority has available for the grant. It is a ceiling and not necessarily the
‘final grant amount’ and in any case not a ‘price’ due to the beneficiaries. It can NOT be
exceeded, e.g. to accommodate higher or anticipated cost.
The maximum grant amount can NOT be increased — even if the eligible costs of the action
are higher than planned.
Specific cases (maximum grant amount):
Contingency reserve (RELEX) — In some programmes, the maximum grant amount
foreseen in the award decision may go beyond the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 to
accommodate a ‘contingency reserve’. In this case, the maximum grant amount in Annex 2
can be raised during the action by activating the contingency reserve (— up to the maximum
grant amount set out in the award decision). This requires the agreement of the granting
authority and must be requested through an amendment (see Article 39).
General > Article 5.3 Funding rate
3. Funding rate
EU grants are normally subject to ‘co-financing’ or ‘co-funding’, meaning that the EU granting
authority does only provide a part of the funding of the action and the remaining parts must
be financed from the beneficiaries’ own resources, income generated by the action (e.g. by
selling results), or financial or in-kind contributions from third parties (e.g. grants from
national or private funding programmes). As such, the EU grants are normally subject to a
single funding rate for the entire action — which is expressed as a fixed percentage and
announced in the call conditions. Through the application of the funding rate (a percentage of
the eligible cost), co-financing is ensured as the remaining no eligible cost will need to be
35EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
covered from other sources. Normally the granting authority does not require any further
information on the sources of co-financing, unless specifically requested for the action.
For some programmes and types of action (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, I3, ERDF-TA, SMP,
RELEX), there are however several funding rates inside the project. These may depend on:
− the type of beneficiaries (e.g. SMEs; for-profit or non-profit legal entities, place of
establishment etc)
− the type of cost categories to be covered (e.g. FSTP)
− the type of activities to be performed (for activity-based grants).
Where funding rates are based on the type of beneficiary, beneficiaries and their affiliated
entities will be assessed separately. The funding rate of a beneficiary does NOT condition the
funding rate of its affiliated entities.
Example: The beneficiary is entitled to a 70 % funding rate, it has an affiliated entity entitled to a
funding rate of 100 %. The cost incurred by the affiliated entities will be funded at 100 % —
despite the lower funding rate of the beneficiary to which it is linked.
In order to avoid abuse, the budget flexibility is restricted. Changes that would entail a higher
funding rate (e.g. change between budget category or activity, relocation of budget (and
tasks) to a beneficiary with higher rate) are always subject to an amendment. Changes
between beneficiaries with different funding rates will be monitored closely, to ensure that
no disproportionate amount of tasks and budget is transferred from the beneficiary to its
affiliated entity or vice versa in order to unduly profit from funding rate differences (budget
transfers that result in substantive or important changes, i.e. changes that would also affect
the description of the action in Annex 1, are subject to a mandatory amendment).
Conditions for the funding rate must normally be complied with throughout the action.
Thus, a change of activity, type of beneficiary, etc. affecting the conditions for the funding rate,
would also require a change of the funding rate (including specific increases or bonuses based on
pre-set conditions) in line with the original call conditions.
General > Article 5.4 Estimated budget, budget categories and forms of funding
4. Estimated budget
The estimated budget of the action is calculated on the basis of the estimated eligible costs
and — if applicable —contributions submitted by the consortium, and is annexed to the Grant
Agreement (Annex 2).
The estimated budget also determines the maximum grant amount for each
beneficiary/affiliated entity and for the action as a whole (see above).
5. Budget categories and forms of funding
The budget categories are listed in Article 6.2 and reflected, for each programme and type
of action, in the budget table in Annex 2.
The standard budget categories which usually apply are the following:
− Personnel costs
− Costs for employees (or equivalent)
− Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract
− Costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment
− Costs for SME owners/beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary (not
all programmes)
36EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− Costs for volunteers’ work (not all programmes)
− Costs for other personnel categories (only SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
− Subcontracting costs
− Purchase costs
− Travel costs, accommodation costs and subsistence costs (all programmes
except RFCS, CCEI)
− Equipment costs
− Costs of other goods, works and services
− Other cost categories
− Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (all programmes except RFCS, EUAF,
CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM)
− Internally invoiced goods and services (only HE, DEP and EDF)
− Indirect costs
Depending on the EU programme and on the the type of action, additional programme-
specific budget categories may apply, for instance:
− HE Access to research infrastructure costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_RI)
− HE PCP/PPI procurement costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_PCP/PPI)
− HE ERC additional funding (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_ERC_Additional funding)
− CEF Studies (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Studies)
− CEF Synergetic elements (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Synergetic elements)
− CEF Works in outermost regions (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Works in outermost regions)
− CEF Land purchase ( see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Land purchase)
− LIFE Land purchase (see Article 6.2.D.X LIFE_Land purchase)
− AMIF EMN ad hoc queries (see Article 6.2.D.X AMIF_EMN ad hoc queries)
These budget categories may be cost-based (actual costs, unit costs, flat-rate costs, lump
sum costs, costs according to usual cost accounting practices) or contribution-based, i.e.
fixed by the granting authority on the basis of a cost-related methodology including e.g.
indirect cost (unit contribution, lump sum contribution, flat-rate contribution) or a non-cost
related methodology (financing not linked to cost). Which of these forms of funding applies,
is shown, for each budget category, in the estimated budget (Annex 2).
If unit costs or contributions are used, the details on the calculation will be explained in
Annex 2a of the Grant Agreement.
General > Article 5.5 Budget flexibility
6. Budget transfers (budget flexibility)
The budget in Annex 2 is an estimation. The budget is therefore in principle flexible (with
certain exceptions, see below).
37EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
A transfer can NOT lead to an increase of the maximum grant amount.
Moreover, you should be aware that the budget table is considered by the granting authority
to reflect the actual situation and may therefore be the basis for certain decisions, such as the
calculation of amounts to be offset from (pre-financing) payments for beneficiaries that have
outstanding debts to the Commission (see Article 22).
As a general principle, beneficiaries may transfer budget among themselves, between
affiliated entities or between budget categories (without requesting an amendment; see
Article 39) and — at the time of reporting — declare costs that are different from the
estimated budget provided that the action remains in line with the description of the action in
Annex 1 (if this is not the case, an amendment is needed, under the conditions of Article 39).
If the incurred eligible costs during the action implementation turn out to be lower than the
estimated eligible costs, the difference can thus be allocated to another beneficiary or
another budget category. The amount reimbursed for the other beneficiary/other budget
category (to which the budget transfer is intended) may thus be higher than planned.
Example: The estimated budget includes personnel costs of EUR 60 000 for beneficiary A and EUR
75 000 for beneficiary B. However, at the end of the action, the actual personnel costs of beneficiary
A are EUR 75 000 due to an increase in salaries or to the need to employ additional personnel to
carry out the tasks mentioned in Annex 1 while the actual personnel costs of beneficiary B are EUR
60 000. This may be acceptable provided the additional costs of beneficiary A fulfil the eligibility
requirements of Article 6 and up to the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 (at the level of the
action).
The following changes always require an amendment:
− changes to the description of the action in Annex 1
− changes to the budget category for volunteers (if used)
− changes to budget categories with lump sums costs or contributions (if used; including
financing not linked to costs)
− changes to budget categories or activities with higher funding rates or budget ceilings
(if used)
− activation of the contingency reserve (where foreseen in the Grant Agreement).
The following require either an amendment or a simplified approval procedure:
− addition of amounts for subcontracts not provided for in Annex 1
− other changes in certain specific cost categories, if specifically provided for in Article
6.2.
Best practice: In case of doubt, the coordinator should consult the granting authority on
whether a change requires an amendment or — at least — a simplified approval procedure.
Specific cases (grant)
Simplified approval procedure (general)— For some cases and types of cost indicated,
the Grant Agreement provides for simplified approval procedures, meaning that beneficiaries
can ask for an ex post approval by the granting authority to accept costs which have been
incurred, but were not planned in the estimated budget. For such simplified approval, they
must declare the costs in question in the next periodic report and flag and justify them.
Simplified approval is however at the full discretion of the granting authority. This means that
the beneficiaries bear the risk that the costs might not be approved at interim or final
payment-stage later on.
Flexibility caps — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, transfers between
budget categories going beyond a certain threshold percentage require an amendment. In
38EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
this case, unauthorised changes going beyond the threshold may be rejected (cost rejection,
applied to beneficiaries concerned/equally among the consortium members).
Financial support to third parties (FSTP) — A transfer from the budget category of
financial support to third parties to any other category usually implies a significant change to
the nature of the action and often requires also changes to the description of the action.
Therefore, such a transfer normally requires an amendment of the Grant Agreement.

6.1 General eligibility conditions
ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
In order to be eligible, costs and contributions must meet the eligibility conditions set out in this Article.
6.1 General eligibility conditions
The general eligibility conditions are the following:
(a) for actual costs:
(i) they must be actually incurred by the beneficiary
(ii) they must be incurred in the period set out in Article 4 (with the exception of costs relating
to the submission of the final periodic report, which may be incurred afterwards; see
Article 21)
(iii) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(iv) they must be incurred in connection with the action as described in Annex 1 and necessary
for its implementation
(v) they must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts
in accordance with the accounting standards applicable in the country where the
beneficiary is established and with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices
(vi) they must comply with the applicable national law on taxes, labour and social security and
(vii) they must be reasonable, justified and must comply with the principle of sound financial
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency
(b) for unit costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the units must:
- be actually used or produced by the beneficiary in the period set out in Article 4
(with the exception of units relating to the submission of the final periodic report,
which may be used or produced afterwards; see Article 21)
- be necessary for the implementation of the action and
(iii) the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records
and documentation (see Article 20)
(c) for flat-rate costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the costs or contributions to which the flat-rate is applied must:
- be eligible
- relate to the period set out in Article 4 (with the exception of costs or contributions
relating to the submission of the final periodic report, which may be incurred
afterwards; see Article 21)
40EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(d) for lump sum costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the work must be properly implemented by the beneficiary in accordance with Annex 1
(iii) the deliverables/outputs must be achieved in the period set out in Article 4 (with the
exception of deliverables/outputs relating to the submission of the final periodic report,
which may be achieved afterwards; see Article 21)
(e) for unit, flat-rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to usual cost accounting practices (if
any):
(i) they must fulfil the general eligibility conditions for the type of cost concerned
(ii) the cost accounting practices must be applied in a consistent manner, based on objective
criteria, regardless of the source of funding
(f) for financing not linked to costs (if any), the results must be achieved or the conditions must be
fulfilled as described in Annex 1.
In addition, for direct cost categories (e.g. personnel, travel & subsistence, subcontracting and other direct
costs) only costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed to it
directly are eligible. They must not include any indirect costs (i.e. costs that are only indirectly linked to the
action, e.g. via cost drivers).
[OPTION for programmes with in-kind contributions eligible: In-kind contributions provided by third
parties free-of charge may be declared as eligible direct costs by the beneficiaries which use them (under the
same conditions as if they were their own, provided that they concern only direct costs and that the third
parties and their in-kind contributions are set out in Annex 1 (or approved ex post in the periodic report, if
their use does not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; ‘simplified approval procedure’).]
1. Eligible costs
The grant can only reimburse eligible costs (and, where applicable, contributions; see Article
6.2.F), i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific conditions set out in this Article.
Therefore, beneficiaries/affiliated entities must enter ONLY eligible costs into the estimated
budget (see Article 5.4), and later on into the financial statements (see Article 21). If
ineligible costs are declared, they will be rejected (see Article 27).
Article 6.1 lists the general eligibility conditions for each form of funding (actual costs, unit,
flat-rate, lump sum, costs according to usual cost accounting practices, financing not linked
to costs); Article 6.2 refers to the specific eligibility conditions for each budget category.
Cost eligibility is NOT the same as beneficiary/action eligibility. The latter are normally
checked upstream (before grant signature/amendment), in order to make sure that only eligible
beneficiaries/actions are selected for a grant. Loss of beneficiary/action eligibility during an ongoing
grant normally leads to termination or change of status (see Articles 32 and 39); costs become
automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility.
For a consolidated list of eligibility issues relating to specific situations/legal framework in
individual countries, see AGA — List of country-specific issues.
41EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. General eligibility conditions for actual costs
In order to be eligible, actual costs must be:
− actually incurred by the beneficiary/affiliated entity, i.e.:
− real and not estimated, budgeted or imputed and
− definitively and genuinely borne by the beneficiary/affiliated entity (not by any
other entity)
− incurred during the action duration, i.e. the generating event that triggers the costs
must take place during the action duration set out in the Data Sheet.
If costs are invoiced or paid later than the end date, they are eligible only if the debt
existed already during the action duration (supported by documentary evidence) and
the final cost are known at the moment of the final report.
Example: Costs of services or equipment supplied to a beneficiary may be invoiced and paid
after the end date of the action, e.g. because of warranty periods, if the services or equipment
were used by the beneficiary during the action duration. By contrast, costs of services or
equipment supplied after the end of the action (or after GA termination) are normally not
eligible.
− entered as eligible costs in the estimated budget, under the relevant budget
category in Annex 2
This requirement is in practice automatically ensured by the IT system, since the
financial statements mirror the budget categories that are available for the estimated
budget. The only thing you need to pay attention to, is whether all the special cost
categories (visible in the estimated budget and financial statements for the
programme) are really eligible under the specific call you applied for (e.g. financial
support to third parties (FSTP), etc; see call conditions). If not, you should leave those
columns empty and NOT enter any costs (they are ineligible and will be rejected).
The requirement also has no impact on budget flexibility; costs may be transferred
between beneficiaries and eligible budget categories without amending the Grant
Agreement, under the conditions set out in Article 5.5.
− connected to the action and necessary for its implementation as described in
Annex 1, i.e. to achieve the action’s objectives
The grant cannot be used to finance activities other than those approved by the
granting authority.
Examples:
1. The activities of the project cost less than foreseen so the beneficiary decides to conduct
additional activities including for example hiring additional staff, organising an additional event,
renewing office equipment. Additional activities regularly require a change of the description of
the action (Annex 1). To be eligible, such reallocation of ‘savings’ need to be pre-discussed with
the granting authority and may regularly require an amendment.
2. Activities that violate the Grant Agreement (e.g. activities that are against the call conditions,
against applicable law, against EU values, etc.) can never be necessary for the implementation
of the action and therefore any cost related to such activities do not fulfil the general eligibility
conditions.
− identifiable and verifiable, i.e. come directly from the beneficiary/affiliated entity’s
accounts, be directly reconcilable with them and supported by documentation
The records and supporting documents must show the actual costs of the work, i.e.
what was actually paid or recorded in the beneficiary’s profit and loss accounts (see
Article 20).
42EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs must be calculated according to the applicable accounting rules of the country in
which the beneficiary is established and according to the beneficiary’s usual cost
accounting practices.
Example: If a beneficiary always charges a particular cost as an indirect cost, it must do so
also for EU and Euratom grants, and should not charge it as a direct cost.
Be aware however, that the usual cost accounting practices may NOT be used as an
excuse for non-compliance with other Grant Agreement provisions. You must bring
your usual cost accounting practices in line with the Grant Agreement (e.g. conditions
for calculating personnel costs; conditions for charging depreciation costs, etc.).
− in compliance with applicable national laws on taxes, labour and social security
and
− reasonable, justified and must comply with the principles of sound financial
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency (i.e. be in line with
good housekeeping practice when spending public money and not be excessive).
‘Economy’ means minimising the costs of resources used for an activity (input), while
maximising quality; ‘efficiency’ is the relationship between outputs and the resources
used to produce them.
Examples:
1. The beneficiary may NOT increase the remuneration of its personnel, upgrade its travel policy
or its purchasing rules because of the grant support.
2. Entertainment or hospitality expenses (including gifts, special meals and dinners) are
generally not eligible.
3. Tips which are not obligatory are not eligible. By contrast, in some countries the invoice
includes a certain mandatory amount as payment for the ‘service’. In this case, the amount
may be considered eligible — if the other eligibility conditions are fulfilled.
Double funding risk — A cost item or element can NOT be declared more than once within
the same or another budget category or activity (e.g. cost for internally invoiced goods and
services cannot include cost elements already charged under equipment cost).
Specific cases (actual costs):
Costs related to preparing, submitting and negotiating the proposals — Can generally
NOT be declared as eligible for the action (they are incurred before the action starts), this
includes cost for the preparation of the consortium agreement which should be signed before
the action starts. However, costs related to updating the consortium agreement may be
eligible if incurred during the action duration and in line with the general and specific
eligibility conditions, in particular being necessary for the implementation of the action.
Travel costs for the kick-off/closing meeting — Even if the first leg of the journey takes
place before the action starting date (e.g. the day before the kick-off meeting), the costs may
be eligible, if the meeting is held during the action duration. The same applies for the last leg
of a journey after the end of the action duration for a closing meeting.
Costs for reporting at the end of the action — Costs related to drafting and submitting
the final report are eligible even if they are incurred after the action duration.
Those costs include the cost of certificates on the financial statements (CFS) required by the
Grant Agreement and the cost of participating in a project review carried out by the granting
authority before the submission of the final report. They may also include the cost of
personnel necessary for the project review or to prepare the final report. However, they can
NOT include any other action activities foreseen in the Annex 1 and undertaken after the end
date of the action. For the daily rate to use for such personnel costs, see Article 6.2.A.1.
43EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs to allow for the participation of disabled people (e.g. costs for sign language
interpreters required for dissemination events organised under the action) — Are eligible if
they fulfil the general and specific eligibility conditions listed under Articles 6.1 and 6.2. The
beneficiaries must keep records (see Article 20) to prove in case of an audit, check or review
the actual costs incurred and that they were necessary for the implementation of the action.
Examples:
1. When subcontracting the organisation of an event that is necessary for the implementation of the
action, a beneficiary may select an offer that ensures full accessibility for persons with disability
under the consideration of best value for money instead of the lowest price.
2. When purchasing goods that are necessary for the implementation of the action, a beneficiary
may purchase goods that ensure accessibility for disabled persons even if this entails a higher
expense than comparable goods that do not offer accessibility.
Cost for security measures — Where the implementation of an action requires additional
security measures, costs can be declared under the appropriate cost category (e.g. personnel
costs for security staff, equipment costs for secure rooms, etc) if in line with the general and
specific eligibility conditions, in particular these cost must be directly connected to the action
and necessary for its implementation. Conversely, costs for security not directly connected to
the action (i.e. normal security measures of the beneficiaries with or without the EU action)
are considered to be fully covered by the indirect costs.
3. General eligibility conditions for unit costs
In order to be eligible, unit costs or contributions must be:
− calculated by multiplying the number of actual units used to carry out the work (e.g.
number of hours worked on the action, number of tests performed, etc.) or produced
by the amount per unit
− the number of units must be necessary for the action
− the units must be used or produced during the action duration
and
− the beneficiaries must be able to show the link between the number of units declared
and the work on the action.
The records and supporting documents must show that the number of units declared was
actually used for the action (see Article 20). The actual costs of the work are not relevant.
Example: A beneficiary which is an SME declares for its owner who does not receive a salary 50
days worked for an action in 2022. If there is an audit, the SME beneficiary must be able to show
a record of the number of days worked by the owner for the action.
Specific cases (unit costs):
Costs declared on the basis of the usual cost accounting practices — If this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA: Average personnel
costs; HE, DEP, EDF: Internally invoiced goods and services), the beneficiaries must use unit
costs using their own usual cost accounting practices. In this case: neither the amount per
unit, nor the calculation method will be set out in Annex 2a of the Grant Agreement.
4. General eligibility conditions for flat-rate costs
In order to be eligible, flat-rate costs or contributions must be:
− calculated by applying a flat rate to certain costs (whether actual, unit or lump sum
costs).
Example (7 % flat rate for indirect costs — most programmes):
44EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
A beneficiary is working on an action and uses a daily rate of EUR 240 for personnel costs. The
beneficiary declares as eligible 40 day-equivalents of personnel costs + EUR 1 400 for other
goods, works and services + EUR 1 500 for subcontracting during the first reporting period.
Eligible direct costs: (40 x 240 = 9 600) + 1 400 + 1 500 = 12 500
Eligible indirect cost: 7 % flat-rate of 12 500= EUR 875
Total eligible costs: 12 500 + 875 = EUR 13 375.
Funding rate of 70 % = EUR 9 362,50.
Example (25 % flat rate for indirect costs — HE, EDF):
A beneficiary is working on an innovation action and uses a daily rate of EUR 240 for personnel
costs. The beneficiary declares as eligible 40 day-equivalents of personnel costs + EUR 1 400
for other goods and services + EUR 1 500 for subcontracting during the first reporting period.
Eligible direct costs: (40 x 240 = 9 600) + 1 400 + 1 500 = 12 500
Eligible indirect cost: 25 % flat-rate of 9 600 + 1 400 (not the 1 500 for subcontracting as the
flat-rate does not apply on this specific cost category) = EUR 2 750
Total eligible costs: 12 500 + 2 750 = EUR 15 250
Funding rate of 70 % = EUR 10 675.
The records and supporting documents must show that the costs to which the flat-rate is
applied are eligible (see Article 20). If a flat-rate is applied, the actual indirect costs are not
relevant for the granting authority and it is not necessary to calculate them precisely nor to
keep any supporting document related to these.
5. General eligibility conditions for lump sum costs
In order to be eligible:
− the lump sum costs or contributions must correspond to the amount of lump sum
costs set out in Annex 2
− the work must have been carried out in accordance to Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement
− the output or result triggering payment of the lump sum must have been achieved
during the action duration.
The records and supporting documents must show that the action tasks have been carried
out as described in Annex 1. The actual costs of the work are not relevant.
6. Financing not linked to costs
In order to be eligible:
− the results must be achieved or the conditions must be fulfilled as described in
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement during the action duration.
7. Direct and indirect costs
‘Direct costs’ are specific costs directly linked to the performance of the action and which can
therefore be directly booked to it.
They are:
− either costs that have been caused in full by the activities of the action
− or costs that have been caused in full by the activities of several actions (projects),
the attribution of which to a single action can, and has been, directly measured (i.e.
not attributed indirectly via an allocation key, a cost driver or a proxy).
The beneficiaries must be able to show (with records and supporting evidence) the link to the
action.
45EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Indirect costs’ are costs that cannot be identified as specific costs directly linked to the
performance of the action.
In practice, they are costs whose link to the action can NOT be (or has not been) measured
directly, but only by means of cost drivers or a proxy (i.e. parameters that apportion the total
indirect costs (overheads) among the different activities of the beneficiary).
Which kinds of cost fall under direct or indirect cost depends on the nature of the action
and may therefore vary between programmes and calls.
Where they are reimbursed as flat-rate (e.g. budget category E. Indirect costs in the EU
action grants), you do NOT need to calctulate the indirect costs incurred for the action. They are
covered by the flat-rate and automatically calculated by the IT system.
8. Conditions for eligible in-kind contributions for free (HE)
If eligible under the Grant Agreement (only for HE), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge costs for in-kind contributions made available for free.
What? These cover the costs, which a third party has for resources it contributes to the
action for free (i.e. made available for free for use by the project).
They must be declared under the budget category the beneficiary would use if they were
their own costs (e.g. ‘Personnel costs for seconded persons’, ‘Equipment costs’, ‘Costs for
other goods, works and services’, etc), as actual or unit cost, depending on the rules of the
budget category.
Example: Depreciation costs of equipment contributed free of charge must be declared under
cost category C.2 Equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2).
In addition to the general and specific eligibility conditions of the budget category used
(see Article 6.1 and 6.2), they must be limited to the direct costs incurred by the third party.
Example: A person not receiving a salary and who is the (co)owner of a SME is being seconded
by this SME (third party) to a beneficiary. The direct costs incurred by the SME can be declared
via the SME owner unit cost (daily rate) (see Article 6.2.A.4).
Moreover, the in-kind contribution and the contributing third party must be mentioned in
Annex 1 (simplified approval procedure; see below).
Specific cases (in-kind contributions eligible):
Simplified approval procedure (new in-kind contributions) — If the need for an in-kind
contribution was not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment
in order to introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk
that the granting authority might not approve the new contribution and reject the costs at
interim or final payment-stage later on.
Internal invoicing of goods and services (HE) — For Horizon Europe, the granting
authority can also accept costs that are internally invoiced in the third party providing in-kind
contributions. In this case, they should be declared under cost category D.2 Internally
invoiced goods and services (see Article 6.2.D.2). In that context, the rules on internal
invoicing apply (e.g. indirect (actual) costs of the third party can be included, depending on
the usual cost accounting practices of the third party when calculating its unit cost for
internally invoiced goods and services).

6.2 Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category
For each budget category, the specific eligibility conditions are as follows:
1. Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category.
All programmes follow in principle the basic set of common budget categories from the
General MGA (A. Personnel, B. Subcontracting, C. Purchases and D. Other). However not all
programmes use all the cost categories and some programmes may have special/additional
budget categories.
The eligibility conditions for all currently used budget categories are described in the following
sections.

General > Article 6.2.A.1 Employees
A.1 Employees (all programmes except SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
A.1 Costs for employees (or equivalent) are eligible as personnel costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility
conditions and are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an employment contract (or
equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the action.
They must be limited to salaries [additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: (including net
payments during parental leave)], social security contributions, taxes and other costs linked to the
remuneration, if they arise from national law or the employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and
be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred, in accordance with the following method:
{daily rate for the person
multiplied by
number of day-equivalents worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The daily rate must be calculated as:
{annual personnel costs for the person
divided by
215}
The number of day-equivalents declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 20).
[additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: The actual time spent on parental leave by a
person assigned to the action may be deducted from the 215 days indicated in the above formula.]
The total number of day-equivalents declared in EU grants, for a person for a year, cannot be higher than
215[additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: minus time spent on parental leave (if any)].
[OPTION A for programmes with standard rules for supplementary payments: The personnel costs may also
include supplementary payments for personnel assigned to the action (including payments on the basis of
supplementary contracts regardless of their nature), if:
- it is part of the beneficiary’s usual remuneration practices and is paid in a consistent manner
whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required
- the criteria used to calculate the supplementary payments are objective and generally applied by the
beneficiary, regardless of the source of funding used.]
[OPTION B for programmes with project-based supplementary payments:
For personnel which receives supplementary payments for work in projects (project-based remuneration), the
personnel costs must be calculated at a rate which:
- corresponds to the actual remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for the time worked by the
person in the action over the reporting period
- does not exceed the remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for work in similar projects funded
by national schemes (‘national projects reference’)
- is defined based on objective criteria allowing to determine the amount to which the person is
entitled
and
- reflects the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay consistently bonuses or supplementary payments
for work in projects funded by national schemes.
The national projects reference is the remuneration defined in national law, collective labour agreement
or written internal rules of the beneficiary applicable to work in projects funded by national schemes.
49EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If there is no such national law, collective labour agreement or written internal rules or if the project-
based remuneration is not based on objective criteria, the national project reference will be the average
remuneration of the person in the last full calendar year covered by the reporting period, excluding
remuneration paid for work in EU actions.]
[additional OPTION for programmes with average personnel costs: If the beneficiary uses average personnel
costs (unit cost according to usual cost accounting practices), the personnel costs must fulfil the general
eligibility conditions for such unit costs and the daily rate must be calculated:
- using the actual personnel costs recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts and excluding any costs
which are ineligible or already included in other budget categories; the actual personnel costs may be
adjusted on the basis of budgeted or estimated elements, if they are relevant for calculating the
personnel costs, reasonable and correspond to objective and verifiable information
and
- according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner, based on
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.]
1. Employees or equivalent (A.1): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS,
CUST/FISC or where declared ineligible in the call conditions), the beneficiaries/affiliated
entities may charge ‘Costs for employees or equivalent’.
This budget category covers the costs for employees or equivalent that worked in the action,
i.e. persons working for the beneficiary on the basis of an employment contract or equivalent
appointing act.
‘Equivalent appointing act’ means the appointing acts of civil servants (who do not sign
employment contracts, but receive official nominations for their posts).
ONLY costs for personnel assigned to the action (i.e. working for the project according to
internal written instructions, organisation chart or other documented management decision) can
be eligible.
Record-keeping — The monthly declaration of days worked in the project correctly signed
(see Article 20) OR reliable time records will normally be sufficient proof of the assignment to the
action — unless there is other contradicting evidence (e.g. the employment contract indicates that
the person was hired to work on another project).
What not? Cost of persons who work for the beneficiary, but NOT with an employment
contract or equivalent appointing act (e.g. staff provided by a temporary work agency,
seconded staff, self-employed persons with a direct contract with the beneficiary).
1.2 Costs for employees (or equivalent) must be declared as:
− actual personnel costs (standard case)
or
50EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− unit costs in accordance with the usual cost accounting practices (‘average personnel
costs’; if option applies in Grant Agreement; option in HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM,
HUMA).
1.3 The costs for employees (or equivalent) must comply with the eligibility conditions set
out in Article 6.2.A.1, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, etc.; see Article 6.1(a) and (b)) and
− be paid in accordance with national law, the collective labour agreement and the
employment contract/equivalent appointing act.
Generally, you may include, for each person concerned, the following:
− fixed salary
− fixed complements, if they are unconditional entitlements for the person (e.g. family
allowance and contributions to medical insurance schemes set out in national law,
complementary pension plan contributions set out in the collective labour agreement
or other binding documents such as staff regulations)
− variable complements, e.g. bonuses, if:
− they are paid based on objective conditions set out, at least, in the internal
rules of the beneficiary
− they are paid in a consistent manner, e.g. not just for actions supported by EU
grants, and
− where applicable, subject to the specific eligibility conditions for supplementary
payments (see specific cases below)
− social security contributions (mandatory employer and employee contributions)
− taxes linked to the remuneration (e.g. income tax withholding)
− other costs and payments linked to the remuneration if they are justified and
registered as personnel costs in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual remuneration
practices (e.g. benefits in kind like company car made available for the private use,
lunch vouchers, accrual for unconditional severance payments mandatory under
national law or other binding documents such as collective labour agreements or other
binding documents such as staff regulations).
You may NOT include:
− any part of the remuneration which has not been an actual cost for you (for example,
salaries reimbursed by a social security scheme or a private insurance in case of long
sick leave or maternity leave)
− payments of dividends to employees (profit distribution in the form of dividends)
− variable complements based on commercial targets or fund raising targets (because
neither incurred in connection with the work of the action, nor necessary for its
implementation)
− arbitrary bonuses (i.e. bonuses which are not paid based on objective conditions set
out, at least, in the internal rules of the beneficiary or bonuses that are not paid in a
consistent manner)
− bonuses that depend on budget availability on the specific project (e.g. paid only if
there are remaining funds in the budget of a project).
51EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Objective conditions’ means conditions which allow to identify who (e.g. what category of
employees) will receive how much (e.g. 5 € extra per hour, 10 % extra salary in each month
of full dedication) in what cases (e.g. time worked as lead researcher in cooperative projects;
an impartial and transparent assessment procedure on performance).
1.4 Calculation of the personnel costs. In most cases you have to calculate your personnel
costs for the action as follows:
Day- Daily rate
equivalents
{actual personnel
costs during the
Personnel Up to a declarable months within the
costs maximum of: reporting period}
{((215 / 12) divided by
multiplied by the
To be calculated
number of months {maximum
per person for
within the reporting declarable day-
each reporting
period
period) multiplied equivalents}
by the working
time factor}
You must do these calculations normally once per reporting period (RP)5 for each person
who worked in the action.
Adaptations may be needed for specific cases, such as project-based remuneration or
average personnel costs, depending on the applicable options in the Grant Agreement
(see specific cases below). Check the Data Sheet of your Grant Agreement, if specific
options apply.
Regarding the calculation of day-equivalents worked in the action:
It is the sum of the day-equivalents actually worked for the action, rounded to the nearest
half-day, and recorded in the monthly declarations or in your time-recording system (if you
have a reliable time-recording system where you record, at least, all the actual time worked
in the action).
For details on the declarations and on how to convert your working time on the action into
day-equivalents, see explanations in Article 20.
5 Alternatively, the calculation may be done separately for each calendar year within the reporting period, if this is
consistently applied. In that case, the ‘number of months within the reporting period’ referred to in the formulas
is to be understood as the number of months of the respective calendar year that are within the reporting
period.
52EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — In case of work on multiple actions per year, the total
number of day-equivalents declared across EU grants for the person can NOT be higher than 215
per calendar year (or the corresponding pro-rata by multiplying 215 with the working time factor),
to avoid double-funding of personnel cost.
Example: In the reporting period form 01/07/2022 to 31/12/2023 the horizontal ceiling per year for a 50%
part-time employee hired on 01/08/2022 would be:
− 2022: (215/12 x 5 [months employed in the RP]) x 0,5 [part-time] = 45 [rounded]
− 2023: (215/12 x 12) x 0,5 = 107,5
Regarding the maximum declarable day-equivalents:
To calculate the daily rate, you first need to determine the maximum declarable day-
equivalents. Since you may not declare more than 100% of your personnel cost, the number
of declarable day-equivalents in each reporting period is capped. The maximum declarable
day-equivalents for each reporting period are calculated as follows:
{((215 / 12) multiplied by the number of months [during which the person is employed] within the
reporting period) multiplied by the working time factor [e.g. 1 for full-time, 0.5 for 50% part time
etc.]}
You will round up or down to the nearest half day-equivalent.
Examples:
The reporting period runs from 01/01/2022 to 30/06/2022 (6 months):
Full-time case: The person is a full-time permanent employee hired in 2020. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 6 [months])
x 1 [full-time] = 107,5
Part-time case: The person is a 50% part-time permanent employee hired in 2020. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 6) x 0.5
[for 50% part-time] = 54
New hire case: The person is a 50% part-time employee hired on 1/06/2022. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 1 [only June
2022]) x 0.5 = 9
The number of months used for the calculation either equates the length of the reporting
period, or the length of employment of the person during this reporting period, if the latter is
shorter (e.g. the person is newly hired or no longer employed at any point during the
reporting period).
Example: In the reporting period from 01/01/2022 to 31/03/2023 (i.e. 15 months) you hire a new
person starting in full-time on 16/01/2023, with 2,5 months left in the reporting period. The
number of months for the calculation of the maximum declarable day-equivalents is accordingly 2,5,
not 15. The maximum number of declarable day-equivalents is ((215/12) x 2,5) x 1 = 45 [rounded
to the nearest half day-equivalent].
For the purpose of all personnel cost calculations a month is considered to have 30 days.
Example: In the reporting period form 01/05/2022 to 31/03/2023, you calculate the number of
months to be used when an employee is hired from 05/05/2022 until 20/10/2022:
- May: 26 days as of the day of being hired, i.e. 26 / 30 = 0,87 months
- June-September: 4 months
- October: 20 days until end of employment, i.e. 20 / 30 = 0,67 months
That is for the person in the reporting period: (26 / 30) + 4 + (20 / 30) = 5,54 months.
If the working time factor changes for the person during the reporting period (e.g. a change
from part-time to full-time, change of contract), you calculate the maximum declarable day-
equivalents separately for the months before and after this change of condition and add them
up afterwards to calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period.
Example:
53EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In the reporting period from 01/01/2022 to 31/03/2023, you work full-time in 2022 and 50% part-
time in 2023. You calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents separately for 2022 and 2023
(because conditions have changed).
12 months of full-time work: ((215 / 12) x 12) x 1 = 215
3 months of part-time work: ((215 / 12) x 3) x 0.5 = 26,88
Total: The maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period are therefore 215 + 26,88
= 242 (rounded to the nearest half day-equivalent).
Regarding the calculation of the daily rate:
You have to calculate a daily rate per person for the reporting period. For this, (irrespective
of the situation, i.e. full-time, part-time, partial hire, etc), you have to use the following
formula:
{actual personnel costs during the months within the reporting period}
divided by
{maximum declarable day-equivalents}
The actual personnel costs for the person are those eligible cost recorded in accordance with
your usual cost accounting practice in your (statutory) accounts until the end of the reporting
period for which you are calculating the daily rate.
Example: For a reporting period running from 01/01/2022 until 31/03/2023, to calculate the daily
rate (which you will apply to days worked by the person in the action from 01/01/2022 until
31/03/2023) you will take into account the total personnel costs of the person recorded in your
statutory accounts for the 12 months in 2022 and the 3 months in 2023 (January, February and
March).
If in line with the conditions described above, the personnel costs can include any component
that is legally obligatory by national law, the employment contract, or a similar act. Apart
from taxes and social security contributions, this may also include for example the thirteenth
salary, Christmas pay, etc. These personnel costs may also include supplementary payments
for personnel assigned to the action (including payments on the basis of supplementary
contracts regardless of their nature) if that is your usual remuneration practice for the kind of
work or expertise required and based on objective criteria used regardless of the source of
funding (i.e. not just for the individual EU grant).
Example:
In the reporting period from 01/12/2021 to 31/05/2023 (18 months), the person works 50% part-
time from 01/12/2021 to 31/05/2022 (6 months) and full-time afterwards (12 months). You
calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents and the daily rate for the reporting period as
follows:
Maximum declarable day-equivalents: Due to a change from part-time to full-time work, you need
to calculate the declarable day-equivalents separately for the period from 01/12/2021 to
31/05/2022 and afterwards. The 6 months of part-time work calculation would be ((215 / 12) x 6) x
0.5 = 53.75 for the part-time which you would have to add up with the result of the calculation for
the 12 months full-time period, which is 215 (i.e. ((215 / 12) x 12) x 1), the maximum number of
declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period would be 53.75 + 215 = 269 (rounded to
nearest half day-equivalent).
Daily rate: After taking into account all eligible elements (salary plus social contribution and taxes
etc.) you recorded in your accounts a total eligible cost of EUR 15 000 personnel costs for working 6
months part-time and EUR 60 000 for 12 months full-time for a total cost of EUR 75 000. The daily
rate for the person is calculated by dividing the personnel costs for the 18 months of work within
the reporting period with the maximum declarable day-equivalents, i.e. EUR 75 000 divided by 269
= EUR 278.81 daily rate.
For personnel costs related to drafting and submitting the final reports incurred after the
action duration (for example related to participation in a project review or to the preparation
of a final report; see Article 6.1),, the daily rate to be used is the one for the last reporting
period. The extra days should simply be added to the days declared in the final reporting
period; there is NO need to calculate a separate daily rate for them. The threshold of
54EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
maximum declarable day-equivalents (see Article 6.2.A.1) will however NOT apply to the
additional days.
Specific cases (costs for employees or equivalent (A.1)):
Teleworking — Teleworking days are accepted if:
− the beneficiary has in place clear rules allowing for teleworking, and
− the teleworked days were in line with those rules (for example: they did not exceed
the maximum days of teleworking allowed by the beneficiary’s rules).
End-of-contract indemnities during the action — If the employment of a person working
on the action ends during the action, the beneficiary may declare cost for end-of-contract
indemnities, if in line with the general and specific eligibility conditions, and in particular that
it is their usual remuneration practices (e.g. required by national law, not just applied for EU
actions, etc) and that these cost have not been included already in the calculation of the daily
rate (e.g. as accrual for unconditional severance payments mandatory under national law).
The eligible part of the indemnity can be charged in the reporting period in which the
employee’s contract ends. Since the entitlement to such indemnities is most often generated
over a period of time longer than the reporting period (or the action), only the part of the
indemnity that corresponds to the time worked by the person on the action can be charged
(i.e. a pro-rata of the indemnity amount in proportion to the time spent on the action). This
pro-rata amount should be added separately on top of the personnel costs calculated on the
basis of the daily rate.
Example:
6 month into the second reporting period (both RPs of 12 month) of an action, a full-time
employee, having worked a total of 154 day-equivalents on the action, stops being employed and
is entitled to an end-of-contract indemnity of EUR 10 750. The employee has accumulated this
indemnity over 5 years (60 months) of employment. You have determined that 3000€ of this are
attributable to the time of employment during the action (taking into account e.g. changes in
salary, indemnity conditions, working time, etc).
To determine the portion of the indemnity chargeable to the grant, you first divide EUR 3000
indemnity (corresponding to the time of employment during the action) by the maximum
declarable day-equivalents of the person during the action, i.e. {EUR 3000 divided by (215
[maximum declarable day-equivalents RP1] + 107,5 [maximum declarable day-equivalents RP2])
} = EUR 9,30 per declarable day-equivalent.
Then you multiply the indemnity amount per day-equivalent with the day-equivalents actually
worked on the action, i.e. EUR 9,30 x 154 [day-equivalents worked on the action in RP1+RP2] =
EUR 1432,20.
Parental leave (option in HE, HUMA) — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement,
days on parental leave during the reporting period may be deducted for the calculation of the
maximum declarable days and the calculation of the daily rate (i.e. by reducing the maximum
declarable day-equivalents in the formulas by the number of day-equivalents spent on
parental leave). Parental leave is any leave directly related to the birth or adoption of a child.
Other leaves or absences can NOT be deducted, including long-term sick leave, breastfeeding
leave and leave to take care of a sick child. The personnel costs used for the calculation of
the daily rate during the reporting period in which the parental leave takes place, may only
contain costs actually incurred by the beneficiary (e.g. exclude any costs already covered by
a national scheme paying the person on parental leave or reimbursing the beneficiary).
Example:
In a reporting period from 01/12/2021 to 31/01/2023 (14 months), an employee working full-time
on the action takes four months of parental leave after the birth of a child, that is 71,67 day-
equivalents (i.e. {((215/12) x 4 [months on parental leave]) x 1 [working time factor as per
contract]}).
The maximum number of declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period is calculated as
follows: {((215/12) x 14 [months]) x 1} minus 71,67 day-equivalents of parental leave = 179,16,
rounded to 179 maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period.
55EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
You will use this number (179) to calculate the daily rate, i.e. (actual personnel costs during the
reporting period) divided by 179.
Multiple parallel or consecutive contracts — If a person is employed with more than one
employment contract with the beneficiary during the reporting period (where allowed by
applicable law), the beneficiary should calculate a single daily rate. The actual personnel
costs are the sum of the costs of all these employment contracts during the months within
the reporting period. The maximum declarable day-equivalents are the sum of the maximum
declarable day-equivalents calculated individually for each of these employment contracts
during the months within the reporting period.
Contracts without fixed salary/hours — The maximum number of declarable day-
equivalents for employees that do not have a fixed amount of salary and working hours
defined in their contract but only an hourly rate (where allowed by applicable law and not
fitting under other cost categories, e.g. SME owners, subcontracting) can be calculated as
follows:
{((total salary paid to the employee in the reporting period) divided by (hourly rate fixed in the
employment contract)) divided by 8 [default day conversion factor]}
Example: A person does not have a fixed amount of working time and salary set out in the
contract but the contract specifies that the persons earns EUR 10/hour when called to perform a
certain task. Under the contract, you paid the persons EUR 7000 during the reporting period. The
maximum declarable day-equivalents are = EUR 7000 / 10 [hourly rate] / 8 = 87,5 for the
reporting period.
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — Such staff can NOT be charged under this
budget category because contracts with temporary work agencies qualify typically as
purchase of services (unless the temporary work agency carries out directly some task of the
action — in which case it would be considered as subcontracting). Although not eligible as
personnel costs, the costs can be charged under other budget categories (i.e. B.
Subcontracting or C.3 Other goods, works and services), if they comply with the eligibility
conditions (e.g. best value for money and no conflict of interest; see Articles 6.2.B and
6.2.C).
Project-based remuneration (option in HE) — If this option is activated in the Grant
Agreement, the beneficiaries may use this specific calculation method for the daily rate.
Note that for Horizon Europe, there are all in all three different ways how to calculate
the daily rate:
Case 1A: employee whose remuneration is fixed, i.e. same remuneration, regardless
whether they are involved in specific projects or not (actual costs; standard case, see 2.1.4
above)
Case 1B: employees whose remuneration increases through supplementary payments
depending on whether they work in specific projects (actual costs; specific case ‘project-
based remuneration’, this section)
Case 2: beneficiaries declaring personnel costs as unit costs in accordance with their usual
cost accounting practices (unit costs; specific case ‘average personnel costs’, see next
specific case below).
Project-based remuneration (Case 1B) should be used for employees (or equivalent) whose
level of remuneration (daily rate, hourly rate) increases when and because the employee
works in (EU, national or other) projects.
Example: An employee who gets a bonus or a new contract with a higher salary level for working
in a project.
56EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Employees whose salary does not increase when working in projects are covered by
Case 1A (not Case 1B); even when:
− the employment contract was signed explicitly to work in the action or
− the contract covering the work in the action is additional to the main contract with
the employee but has the same remuneration level as the main contract (i.e. same
hourly/daily rate) or
− part of the work in the action was done during overtime and the overtime hours are
paid at a higher rate resulting from national law, collective agreement or
employment contract, provided that such higher rate does not depend on projects.
For project-based remuneration (Case 1B), the daily rate must be calculated as follows:
Step 1 — Calculate the Case 1B action daily rate per person:
{actual personnel costs for work on the action [incl. project-based supplementary
payments, bonuses, increased salary, etc] during the months within the reporting
period}
divided by
{day-equivalents worked by the person on the action during the months within the
reporting period}
For the calculation of the action daily rate you may include the same elements in the
personnel costs as in Case 1A for the daily rate PLUS all bonuses you paid which were
triggered by the participation in the action (even if those bonuses were not based on
objective conditions). Bonuses triggered by the participation of the employee in other
projects must be excluded.
Step 2 — Compare the action daily rate with the national project daily rate, i.e. the
(theoretical) daily rate that you would pay to the person for work in national projects,
in accordance with your usual remuneration practices. The daily rate to be used for
the EU grant financial statement will be the lower of the two. In other words, if the
action daily rate is higher than the national project daily rate, then you will have to
use the national rate for that reporting period.
‘National projects’ are to be understood in the large sense, meaning all types of
projects funded under any type of national (public or private) funding scheme,
including projects co-financed by EU funds that are managed by EU Member States
(e.g. Regional Funds, Agricultural and Fisheries Funds). This must exclude EU grants
as defined in the Grant Agreement, i.e. actions funded by the EU Commission, EU
executive agencies or other funding bodies, which do not qualify as national projects.
The (theoretical) national project daily rate must be calculated the as follows:
{theoretical personnel costs for similar work in a national project over the same number
of months as the reporting period}
divided by
{maximum declarable day-equivalents}
The remuneration to which the person would be entitled to for work in national
projects must be defined:
− either in regulatory requirements (such as national law or collective labour
agreements)
− or in your written internal remuneration rules.
57EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the regulatory requirements or your written internal remuneration rules:
− provide for a bonus range (e.g. between 500 and 1000; between 10% and
50%) or a maximum ceiling (e.g. up to 50) rather than a precise amount per
day or per hour, the remuneration to which the person would be entitled to
(national project daily rate) is the average of the remuneration that the person
received for work in national projects in the complete year before the end of
the reporting period (e.g. calendar, financial or fiscal year depending on the
beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices) for which data is available (see
further below).
Example: If the beneficiary has calculated the action daily rate for a 18 month-
reporting period from 01/09/2021 to 28/02/2023, the average of the remuneration that
the person received for work in national projects could be calculated based on the data
of the complete calendar year 2022 (if available, otherwise of 2021 or the latest
available calendar, financial or fiscal year before 2021).
− provide for different levels of remuneration depending on the staff category,
the remuneration to which the person would be entitled to is the one of the
category to which the person belongs
− provide for different levels of remuneration depending on the type of
nationally-funded projects (and/or the type of work within these projects), the
remuneration to which the person would be entitled to is the one applicable to
the type of project (and/or work) that is closest to the action
− change over the reporting period, the remuneration to which the person would
be entitled to is the one that was applicable for the larger part of that reporting
period.
If there are no regulatory requirements and you do not have internal rules defining
objective conditions on which the national project daily rate can be determined, but
you can demonstrate that your usual practice is to pay bonuses for work in national
projects, the national project daily rate is the average of the remuneration that the
person received in the last complete year (calendar, financial or fiscal year, see
above) before the end of the reporting period for work in national projects calculated
as follows:
{(total personnel costs of the person in the last complete year) minus (remuneration paid
for EU actions during that complete year)}
divided by
{215 minus (days worked in EU actions during that complete year)}
‘EU actions’ are EU grants as defined in the Grant Agreement (i.e. awarded by EU
institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, including EU executive agencies, EU
regulatory agencies, EDA, joint undertakings).
‘Total personnel costs’ covers all types of contracts with the person that qualify
as personnel costs under Article 6.2.A.
If during the last reference period the person worked for the beneficiary only in EU
grants as defined in the Grant Agreement, you must calculate the national project
daily rate using the year before (or the last year in which the person worked in a
national project).
If the person is a new employee hired in the reporting period, their national project
daily rate, calculated according to the formula above, is the one applicable to the
employee whose base salary (salary without bonuses) is the most similar to that
person’s.
58EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Average personnel costs (option in HE, DEP, CEF, EDF, UCPM, HUMA,) — If this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement , beneficiaries who consistently calculate average rates for
their staff as part of their analytical cost accounting system, can use these average rates for
the daily rate.
You can use this method, provided that:
− the daily rate is calculated using the actual personnel costs recorded in your accounts,
excluding any ineligible cost or costs already included in other budget categories (no
double funding of the same costs)
Therefore, you may have to adjust your usual methodology in order to remove:
− costs that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement
Example: The daily rate in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices contains taxes not linked to the remuneration. Those taxes are ineligible and
must be removed when calculating the daily rates for the action.
− costs that are already included in other budget categories
Example: Beneficiaries whose cost accounting practices for personnel costs include
indirect costs. Indirect costs must be removed from the pool of costs used to calculate
the daily rate charged to the action because indirect costs must be declared using a flat
rate. Personnel costs cannot include any indirect costs.
If your usual methodology includes budgeted or estimated elements, we can only
accept those, if they:
− are relevant (i.e. clearly related to personnel costs)
− are used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not play a major role in the calculation)
− correspond to objective and verifiable information (i.e. their basis is clearly
defined and you can show how they were calculated)
Example: Calculating average 2021 daily rates by using 2020 payroll data and
increasing them by adding the CPI (consumer price index) on which the basic salaries
are indexed.
− you apply your cost accounting practices in a consistent manner, based on objective
criteria that must be verifiable if there is a check, review, audit or investigation. You
must do this no matter who is funding the action.
This does not mean that cost accounting practices must be the same for all your
employees, departments or cost centres. If, for example, your usual cost accounting
practices include different calculation methods for permanent personnel and
temporary personnel, this is acceptable. However, you cannot use different methods
for specific actions, projects or persons on an ad-hoc basis.
Example (acceptable): Individual (actual) personnel costs are used for researchers, average
personnel costs (unit costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices) are used for technical support staff.
Example (unacceptable): Average personnel costs are used to calculate costs in externally-
funded projects only.
If your usual cost accounting practice is to calculate hourly rates instead of daily rates, you
must convert the hourly rate into a daily rate as follows:
Daily rate = hourly rate x 8
Alternative: If you have a usual cost accounting practice determining the standard number of
annual productive hours of a full-time employee, you can alternatively multiply by the
number of hours resulting from the following formula (instead of by 8):
59EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
{The higher of: (the standard number of annual productive hours of a full-time employee
according to your practice) OR (90 % of the standard annual workable hours of a full-time
employee)}
divided by
215

General > Article 6.2.A.2, A3 Natural persons with direct contract and seconded persons
A.2 Natural persons with direct contract and seconded persons (all programmes except
SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
A.2 and A.3 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract other than an employment
contract and costs for seconded persons by a third party against payment are also eligible as personnel
costs, if they are assigned to the action, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and:
(a) work under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way the work is
organised, the tasks that are performed and the premises where they are performed) and
(b) the result of the work belongs to the beneficiary (unless agreed otherwise).
They must be calculated on the basis of a rate which corresponds to the costs actually incurred for the direct
contract or secondment and must not be significantly different from those for personnel performing similar
tasks under an employment contract with the beneficiary.
1. Natural persons with direct contract (A.2) and seconded persons (A.3): Types of
costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS,
CUST/FISC), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Costs for natural persons under
direct contract’ or ‘Costs for seconded persons’.
These budget categories cover the costs of two types of persons:
− self-employed natural persons (e.g. some types of in-house consultants) who work on
the action for the beneficiary under conditions similar to those of an employee, but
under a contract that is legally not an employment contract
− persons who are seconded by a third party against payment.
‘Seconded’ means the temporary transfer of an employee from a third party (the employer)
to the beneficiary. Seconded persons are still paid and employed by the third party, but work
for the beneficiary. They are at the disposal of the beneficiary and work under its control and
instructions. A secondment normally requires the seconded person to work at the
beneficiary’s premises, although in specific cases it may be agreed otherwise in the
secondment agreement.
Best practice: The secondment agreement should detail the conditions of secondment (tasks,
reimbursement from one entity to the other, duration of the secondment, location, etc).
What not? Cost of persons who are employees of the beneficiary, (co)owners of the
beneficiary (if the beneficiary is an SME) or staff provided by a temporary work agency.
1.2 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract and persons seconded against
payment must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs of natural persons with direct contract (A.2) and seconded persons (A.3) must
comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.2 and 6.2.A.3, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration by the beneficiary, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− the person must be hired under either:
− a direct contract signed between you and the natural person (not through
another legal entity; e.g. a temporary work agency) or
61EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− a contract signed between you and a legal entity fully owned by that natural
person, and which has no other staff than the natural person being hired or
− a secondment agreement with the employer of the natural person
− the person must work under conditions similar to those of an employee, in particular:
− the beneficiary must organise and supervise the work of the person in a way
similar to that of its employees
Example (acceptable): The beneficiary's project leader and the person discuss
regularly the work to be carried out for the action. The project leader decides the tasks
and timing of the work and instructs the person accordingly.
Example (not acceptable): The beneficiary's project leader and the person meet only
once a month or irregularly, for updates on the state of play of the entrusted work. If
changes are needed, they have to be agreed by the person and may lead to a change of
the amount charged to the beneficiary.
− the person is subject to similar presence requirements as the employees
Examples (acceptable):
1. The person works physically at the beneficiary's premises, following a time schedule
similar to that of the employees (e.g. the beneficiary authorises up to two days of
teleworking per week to its personnel and the person has chosen to benefit from this
regime, i.e. works 2 days in teleworking and 3 days physically at the beneficiary's
premises).
2. The beneficiary does not require any presence at its premises and allows all its
employees to telework full-time from anywhere in the world. The person choses to
telework from home, i.e. the country where the seconding organisation is established.
Examples (not acceptable):
1. The beneficiary applies a consistent policy of only authorising up to two days of
teleworking per week. However, the person works four days per week in teleworking
and only one day at the beneficiary's premises.
2. The beneficiary applies a consistent policy of requiring all staff to work at its
premises. However, the person works from a country other than the one where the
beneficiary is located.
− the remuneration must be based on working time, rather than on delivering
specific outputs/products.
Similar conditions does not mean equal conditions. The working conditions of the
person do NOT have to be exactly the same that those of an employee, but overall
similar.
− the result of the work carried out (including patents or copyright) must in principle
belong to the beneficiary; if (exceptionally) it belongs to the person, the beneficiary
must (just like for employees) obtain the necessary rights from the person (transfer,
licences or other), in order to be able to respect its obligations under the Grant
Agreement
− the cost of the person must not be significantly different from costs for employees of
the beneficiary performing similar tasks; if the beneficiary does not have employees
performing similar tasks, the comparison must be done with national salary references
of the country where the beneficiary is located, for the staff category to which the
person belongs in the sector of activity of the beneficiary and
− the cost must correspond exclusively to the remuneration of the person and related
eligible taxes.
62EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the costs do not fulfil all the conditions indicated here above, they may be eligible as
purchase of services (see Article 6.2.C.3) or subcontracting (see Article 6.2.B) but NOT as
personnel costs.
Thus, for seconded persons, if the resulting daily rate is higher than the daily rate actually
paid by the third party to the seconded person (applying the calculation rules of the Grant
Agreement) the costs can NOT be declared as personnel costs. They may be eligible instead as
purchase of services (see Article 6.2.C.3) or subcontracting (see Article 6.2.B). The reason is that
in this case the payment made by the beneficiary to the third party would be higher than the
actual remuneration of the person, and this implies that there is a commercial margin (or
other non-personnel cost) that is being charged by the third party to the beneficiary.
1.4 Costs of natural persons working under a direct contract and seconded persons against
payment must be calculated as follows:
{amount per unit [daily rate]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate must be calculated as follows:
− if the contract specifies a daily rate: this daily rate must be used; if the contract fixes
an hourly rate instead of a daily rate, you must convert the hourly rate into a daily
rate (daily rate = hourly rate x 8)
− if the contract states a fixed amount for the work and the number of days to be
worked (or hours; in that case 8 hours = 1 day-equivalent): the global amount for the
work must be divided by the number day-equivalents to be worked
− if the contract states a fixed amount for the work, but does not specify the number of
days (or hours) that must be worked: the global amount for the work must be divided
by the pro-rata of 215 annual day-equivalents which corresponds to the duration of
the contract over the reporting period
Example: The contract provides that the person will work at the beneficiary's premises for
assisting in action tasks. The contract is for 6 months starting on 01/01/2021 and ending on
30/06/2021. According to its time records, the person worked 60 day-equivalents in the action
over that period. The contract sets a monthly payment of EUR 3 000 but does not explicitly
establish the number of days/hours to be worked.
Personnel costs for the action = 60 (day-equivalents worked in the action) x daily rate
Daily rate = annual personnel costs / pro-rata of 215 = (3 000 € x 6 months) / (215 x (6
months/12 months)) = 18 000 € / (215 x 0,5) = 18 000 € / 107,5 days = 167,44 €/day
Personnel costs for the action = 60 x 167,44 = 10 046,4€.
Cost elements that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (even if they are part of the
amount stated in the contract) must be removed from the calculation of the personnel cost.
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — If a pro-rata number of 215 annual day-equivalents is used
in the calculation of the amount per unit (daily rate), you must respect the horizontal ceiling (see
Article 6.2.A.1).
Maximum declarable day-equivalents — If a number of day-equivalents (specified directly
in the contract or determined via a pro-rata of 215 day-equivalents) is used in the calculation of
the amount per unit (daily rate), you can NOT declare more day-equivalents worked on the action
than the number of day-equivalents used to calculate the daily rate.
63EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Specific cases (costs for natural persons with direct contract and seconded
personnel (A.2, A.3)):
Persons seconded against payment from a third party located in a different country
than the beneficiary — As salary levels are not homogeneous across different countries,
the remuneration of the person paid by the third party, and so the actual costs paid for the
secondment, might be higher than those paid by the beneficiary for employees performing
similar tasks. In that case, the actual costs paid for the secondment can still be considered
eligible, if the beneficiary can demonstrate that its usual practice is to pay for secondments at
the level of the actual remuneration of the seconded person.
Secondment of staff between beneficiaries/affiliated entities — Is allowed, but it is
the beneficiary/affiliated entity who employs the person who has to declare its costs (NOT the
beneficiary/affiliated to whom the person has been seconded).
Fellowships, scholarships, stipends, internship or similar agreements (not
employees) — Costs for persons (e.g. students, PhDs and other researchers) under
fellowships, scholarships, stipends, internship or similar agreements, through which they
work for the beneficiary on the action (without having an employment contract) can be
accepted, if the agreement is work-oriented (as opposed to training-oriented: i.e. not aimed
at helping the student to acquire professional skills).
Such cost can be charged to the action as personnel costs, if they fulfil the conditions set out
in Article 6.1 and 6.2.A.2, and in particular:
− the assignment of tasks and the remuneration complies with the applicable national
law (e.g. on taxes, labour and social security)
− the recipients of fellowships, scholarships and stipends have the necessary
qualifications to carry out the tasks allocated to them under the action.
PhD agreements are considered work-oriented. However, time for training, if any, may NOT
be charged to the action.
Fellowships, scholarships and stipends, etc. that are not work-oriented are cannot be charged
as personnel costs, but may be eligible as financial support to third parties (FSTP; cost
category D.1), if explicitly allowed by the call conditions and in line with Annex 1 (see Article
6.2.D.1).
Cost for exemptions from academic fees (HE) — The fees (or the fee exemption) are
eligible as personnel cost, if the student contract includes the amount of waived fees as part
of their remuneration. The other conditions set out in Article 6 have to be fulfilled as well
(e.g. the full remuneration, included the value of the waived fees, must be recorded in the
university’s accounts).

General > Article 6.2.A.4 SME owners and natural person beneficiaries
A.4 SME owners and natural person beneficiaries (all programmes except SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI)
[additional OPTION for programmes with SME owner unit cost: A.4 The work of SME owners for the
action (i.e. owners of beneficiaries that are small and medium-sized enterprises20 not receiving a salary) or
natural person beneficiaries (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary) may be
declared as personnel costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.]
20 For the definition, see Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC: micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) are enterprises
- engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of their legal form (including, in particular, self- employed persons and family
businesses engaged in craft or other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity) and
- employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Recommendation) and
which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43
million.
1. SME owners and natural person beneficiaries (A.4): Types of costs — Forms —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS, EUAF,
CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘SME owner/natural
person beneficiary costs’.
This budget category covers the costs of two types of persons:
− Persons who are directly owners or co-owners (regardless of their percentage of
ownership) of the beneficiary, if the beneficiary is an SME and the person is not an
employee of the beneficiary. It applies also to SME owners whose work in the action
for the beneficiary is remunerated via any type of non-employment contract (e.g. a
service contract), via profit distribution or by any remuneration method other than a
salary resulting from an employment contract.
− Beneficiaries who are natural persons; i.e. who signed the Grant Agreement on
her/his own name as individuals, not on behalf of another legal person (e.g. a
company).
‘Directly’ means not owners (or co-owners) through another company owned by them.
What not? SME owners who receive a salary (registered as such in the accounts of the SME)
cannot declare personnel costs under this budget category, unless they can show that this
salary corresponds exclusively to the management of the SME (and is therefore not linked to
the action).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit cost, using the unit cost (daily rate) fixed by the
authorising decision C(2020)71156 and set out in Annex 2a.
6 Commission Decision of 20 October 2020 authorising the use of unit costs for the personnel costs of the owners
of small and medium-sized enterprises and beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary for the
work carried out by themselves under an action or work programme (C(2020)7715).
65EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The amount per unit (daily rate) is prefixed in the authorising decision, adjusted depending
on the country where the beneficiary/affiliated entity is established:
Amount per unit [daily rate] = {EUR 5 080 /18 days [i.e. 282,22]}
multiplied by
{country-specific correction coefficient of the country where the
beneficiary is established}
The country-specific correction coefficient is the one for HE MSCA actions (see Horizon Europe
Work Programme > Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions in force at the time of the call).
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.4, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be declared for an SME owner/natural person beneficiary, who works on the action but
does not receive a salary.
The granting authority may verify that the beneficiary fulfils the conditions for using this unit
cost.
1.4 The costs must be calculated, for the SME owner/natural person, in accordance with the
methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the SME owner/natural person personnel costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed in the authorising decision (see above).
The calculation itself is automated by the IT system. The beneficiary/affiliated entity must
only indicate the number of days worked on the action and the system will then correctly
calculate the personnel costs (based on the parameters described above).
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — For SME owner/natural person beneficiaries unit costs, the
horizontal ceiling (see Article 6.2.A.1) applies not only in case of work on multiple actions, but also
where the person worked in only one EU grant during a given calendar year.

[additional OPTION for programmes with volunteers costs: A.5 The work of volunteers for the action (i.e.
persons who freely work for an organisation, on a non-compulsory basis and without being paid) may be
declared as personnel costs, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.
They:
- may not exceed the maximum amount for volunteers for the action (which corresponds to 50% of the
total (ineligible and eligible) project costs and contributions estimated in the proposal)
- may not exceed the maximum amount for volunteers for each beneficiary set out in Annex 2
- may not make the maximum EU contribution to costs higher than the total eligible costs without
volunteers.
If also indirect costs for volunteers are declared eligible in the call conditions, the amount of indirect costs
may be added to the volunteers costs category in Annex 2, at the flat-rate set out in Point E.]
1. Volunteers (A.5): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (ERDF-TA, LIFE, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV,
JUST, ESF/SOCPL, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM, RELEX), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Volunteers costs’.
This budget category allows to increase the grant amount in order to recognise the
contribution of volunteers in the project, i.e. when persons work for the beneficiary, on a
non-compulsory basis and without being paid.
What not? The unit costs for volunteers work do not cover any actual costs which might be
incurred and paid by the beneficiary, such as insurance, social security, travel or subsistence
costs. Any such costs can be declared and reimbursed separately (if provided for in the call
conditions).
1.2. The work carried out by volunteers can be declared as unit cost, using the unit cost
fixed by the authorising decision C(2019)26467 and set out in Annex 2a.
The amount per unit (daily rate) is prefixed in the authorising decision, depending on the
country where the volunteering activity takes place:

1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.5, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)).
In addition, a double cap must be applied to limit the amounts declared for volunteers' work
or the amount of the total EU contribution:
− the total EU contribution must be less than the total eligible costs excluding volunteer
work.
− the amounts declared for volunteers work must also not exceed the maximum amount
for volunteers for each beneficiary set out in Annex 2.
1.4. The costs must be calculated, for the volunteer working on the action, in accordance
with the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the volunteer personnel costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate depending on country]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed in the authorising decision (see above).
If a use per hour is necessary, you must convert the daily rate as follows: hourly rate = daily
rate / 8).
68EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If explicitly allowed by the call conditions, you can also add indirect costs to the volunteers
costs.
This calculation is however not automated in the system (i.e. the automatically calculated
indirect costs in cost category E will not include this extra amount). If you want to charge the
indirect costs, you must add them manually to the costs in cost category A.5 Volunteers
costs, on top of the direct volunteers costs (i.e. calculate the indirect volunteers costs:
{indirect cost flat rate x direct volunteers costs} and add this amount to the volunteers costs
in cost category A.5).

1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Other personnel costs’.
Such cost categories exist currently only in a limited number of EU programmes (HE, SMP
ESS, CUST/FISC):
− HE personnel unit cost (see Article 6.2.A.6 HE_Personnel unit costs)
− SMP ESS personnel costs based on time (see Article 6.2.A.6 SMP_ESS_Personnel unit

[additional OPTION for HE: A.6 For beneficiaries with personnel unit cost, the personnel costs under
categories A.1-A.4 must be declared as unit cost and are eligible, if they fulfil the general eligibility
conditions, are calculated as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a and comply with
the conditions set out in Points A.1-A.4 for the underlying types of costs (personnel).]
1. HE Personnel unit cost (A.6): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for all Horizon Europe types of action which are
mixed actual cost grants (e.g. RIA, CSA, PCP/PPI, COFUND, ERC, EIC, EIT).
This cost category is optional in the sense that it is granted only on request. However,
once the unit cost is approved, it must be used in all HE actions (i.e. new proposals
submitted after the approval date and not yet signed grants under preparation; and
including to calculate personnel costs for lump sum grants in the proposal’s detailed
budget table).
The approved unit cost is valid for at least two years. You may request an update to
the unit cost amount, every two years after the approval date, until 31 December 2027.
The updated unit cost will apply to all the beneficiary’s Horizon Europe and Euratom
proposals that are invited to grant preparation after the new approval date.
You may change your mind ONCE. After the approval you may, if needed, request to
revert back to actual personnel costs (i.e. charging costs under categories A1 to A4), for
all future grants signed after the unit cost is withdrawn (ongoing grants would not be
impacted). Please be aware that if you revert back to actual costs, you will not be able to
request again the use of the personnel unit cost for the rest of the MFF period 2021-2027.
For beneficiaries/affiliated entities that have selected this unit cost, they must (once
approved) charge all their personnel costs under ‘HE Personnel unit cost’.
This budget category replaces categories A1-A4 (A.1 Employees, A.2 Natural persons with
direct contract, A.3 Seconded persons against payment, or A.4 SME owners and natural
person beneficiaries) and covers the cost of all personnel that works on HE actions.
What not? Cost category A.6 can NOT be used to declare costs for personnel with other
kinds of working relationships (e.g. staff provided by a temporary work agency must still be
declared either as purchase of services or subcontracting).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs, using the unit cost (daily rate) approved by
the granting authority in accordance with the HE personnel unit cost authorising decision8 and
set out in Annex 2a.
8 Decision of 15 January 2024 authorising the use of unit costs for personnel costs for actions under the Horizon
Europe and Euratom Programmes.
71EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The precise unit cost (daily rate, i.e. EUR/day) is not prefixed by the authorising decision. It
must be calculated and approved for each beneficiary/affiliated entity organisation in the
Portal Participant Register.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (daily rate) is:
Amount per unit [daily rate] = {total staff costs of the beneficiary in the last closed full financial
year9}
divided by
{annual work units in the last closed full financial year²}
divided by
{215 days}
The result is subject to a maximum cap per country.
{EUR 9 618 multiplied by the corresponding country-specific correction coefficient
divided by
18 days}
The country-specific correction coefficient is the one for HE MSCA actions (see Horizon Europe
Work Programme > Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions in force at the time of the approval).
You can make a test calculation by using the wizard available on the Portal.
In order to formally request the use of the personnel unit cost, the request must be
submitted by the organisation’s legal entity authorised representative (LEAR) through the
Portal (by entering total staff costs in the last closed full financial year, number of annual
work units and country of establishment). It must be supported by an audit certificate
(template to be used) provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent
and complies with Directive 2006/43/EC (or for public bodies: by a competent independent
public officer. The amount approved will be accessible in the Portal Participant Register.
The granting authority may verify that the provided data in the audit certificate match those
in the statutory annual accounts and/or other official documents on which the audit certificate
was delivered (and correct it, if needed).
For more information concerning the unit cost validation procedure, see HE Personnel unit cost
validation procedure.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.6, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b))
− be calculated in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a
− be declared based on the number of day-equivalents for persons working on the action
and

72EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− comply with the specific conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.1-A.4 for the underlying
types of costs. This means that costs can be declared in category A.6 only for
personnel who have a working relationship with the beneficiary/affiliated entity falling
under the categories A.1 Employees, A.2 Natural persons with direct contract, A.3
Seconded persons against payment, or A.4 SME owners and natural person
beneficiaries. Since in HE in-kind contributions are eligible, cost category A.6 may also
be used for seconded persons free-of-charge who have such a working relationship
with a third party (e.g. an employee of a third party seconded free-of-charge to the
beneficiary).
1.4 The costs must be calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the
authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the HE personnel unit costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate approved in the Portal Participant Register]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed by the granting authority in the Participant Register, based on the rate
requested by the beneficiary/affiliated entity (see above).
The calculation itself is automated by the IT system. The beneficiary/affiliated entity must
only indicate the number of days worked on the action and the system will then correctly
calculate the personnel costs (based on the parameters described above)
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — For HE Personnel unit costs, the horizontal ceiling (see Article
6.2.A.1) applies not only in case of work on multiple actions, but also where the person worked in
only one EU grant during a given calendar year.

A.6 Customs/Fiscalis personnel costs
A.6 Customs/Fiscalis personnel costs are eligible, if (and in as far as) declared eligible in the call conditions
and if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit cost in accordance with the
method set out in Annex 2a and the following:
{daily rate
multiplied by
number of actual days worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The number of actual days declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 20).
The daily rate is the rate of the pay grade set out in Annex 2a (or — for personnel without an applicable pay
grade — the rate of the grade with the closest basic salary).

1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for all CUST/FISC actions.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge their personnel costs under
‘Customs/Fiscalis personnel costs’.
This budget category replaces categories A.1-A.5 and covers the cost of all personnel that
works on CUST/FISC actions.
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs, using the individual unit cost salary grid (daily
rates) agreed with the granting authority (see CUST/FISC authorising decision11 and Annex
2a and 2b).
The precise unit cost (daily rates, i.e. EUR/day) is not prefixed by the authorising decision. It
must be calculated for each grant and then entered into the unit cost table in Annex 2b of the
Grant Agreement.
For more information concerning the salary grid validation, see CUST/FISC Unit cost grid
validation procedure.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.6, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be declared for a person working on the action.

[OPTION 2 for programmes with subcontracting (standard):
Subcontracting costs for the action (including related duties, taxes and charges[OPTION for programmes
with VAT eligible:, such as non-deductible or non-refundable value added tax (VAT))]) are eligible, if they
are calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are
awarded using the beneficiary’s usual purchasing practices — provided these ensure subcontracts with best
value for money (or if appropriate the lowest price) and that there is no conflict of interests (see Article 12).
Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU Directives on public
procurement must also comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.
[additional OPTION for programmes with additional subcontracting rules: [OPTION if selected for the
call21: In addition, if the value of the subcontracts to be awarded exceeds EUR […], the beneficiaries must
comply with the following rules: […].]]
[additional OPTION for programmes with country restrictions for subcontracting costs: [OPTION if
selected for the call: The beneficiaries must ensure that the subcontracted work is performed in the eligible
countries or target countries set out in the call conditions — unless otherwise approved by the granting
authority.]]
[[OPTION if selected for the grant22: Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the action.]]
The tasks to be subcontracted and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1 and the
total estimated costs of subcontracting per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2 (or may be approved ex
post in the periodic report, if the use of subcontracting does not entail changes to the Agreement which would
call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants;
‘simplified approval procedure’).]
21 If the RAO decides to set specific rules, they must be set out in the call and take into account the value of the contracts and the relative
size of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk (proportionality). Specific rules may only be set for the
award of contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000.
22 This is a standard obligation for all EU grants. It may be unselected only for actions where subcontracting is a key/large part of the action
(e.g infrastructure projects; PCP/PPI; technical assistance, statistical programmes, etc).
1. Subcontracting costs (B.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes), beneficiaries/affiliated
entities may charge ‘Subcontracting costs’.
This budget category covers subcontracted action tasks, i.e. contracts for parts of the project
described in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1) that are not implemented by the
beneficiary itself, but by a subcontractor.
78EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Subcontracts are normally wide in scope (implementation of a part of the project, i.e.
action tasks). If a contract covers only individual equipment or consumables that do not
constitute an action task by itself, this will be considered as a purchase (see Article 6.2.C.2
and C.3).
Only limited parts of the action may be subcontracted — unless explicitly allowed in
the call conditions/Grant Agreement. Limited parts means that subcontracting remains
proportionate both in terms of share and type of subcontracted action tasks, as well as in
terms of share in the eligible cost. The acceptable limit is assessed by the granting
authority based on the nature of the action, which may vary between programmes and
calls. For some programmes with large infrastructure projects (e.g. CEF), it is
systematically disactivated.
1.2 Subcontracting costs must be declared as actual costs.
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.B, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− be based either on the best value for money (considering the quality of the service,
good or work proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest price
− not be subject to conflict of interest and
− for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ within the
meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24, 2014/25 and
2009/81)12: comply with the applicable national law on public procurement; these
rules normally provide for special procurement procedures for the types of contracts
they cover.
The beneficiaries can in principle freely choose between best value for money and lowest
price.
Best value for money applies the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial
management) to the subcontracting context.
A competitive selection of subcontractors should be the default approach since it is the safest
way to ensure no conflict of interest, best value for money or lowest price through direct
comparisons between offers. However, subcontracting does not necessarily require
competitive selection procedures to be eligible, provided that, in case of a check, review,
audit or investigation, the beneficiary can prove compliance with best value for money or
lowest price AND no conflict of interest, for instance by showing:
− data from a previous competitive tender on a similar subject that confirms the market
value
− a conducted market consultation, e.g. price quotations, supplier brochures, or
consultation with help of independent experts

79EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− that no suitable offers have been submitted in response to a prior competitive
selection procedure
− that a subcontractor is in a monopoly situation due to technical reasons; or exclusive
(intellectual property) rights; or acquisition of a unique work of art or artistic
performance; or that the task can only be performed by an international organisation
which cannot participate in competitive procedures according to its statutes
− that the subcontractor is the winner of a prior competitive design contest under the
action or a linked action
− a need for special security measures in order to protect the essential interests of the
EU or Member States in accordance with the call conditions.
The beneficiary must be able to demonstrate that the criteria defining quality were clear and
coherent with the purpose.
Best practice: It is recommended to entrust the decision of awarding a contract to an
evaluation committee rather than to a sole person. Members of the evaluation committee
should be aware that they need to disclose the existence of a conflict of interest. The
beneficiary should have clear rules and guidance on situations of conflict of interest. These
rules should provide information on who to contact for advice or disclose the conflict to and,
where necessary, the appropriate action. It is good practice that staff involved in the
procurement process formally signs a declaration of no conflict of interests before performing
their duties.
Subcontracts (tasks to be subcontracted and estimated costs; not necessarily the
subcontractor, especially if not yet known) must be justified in Annex 1 (simplified approval
procedure allowed; see below).
1.4 Regarding the calculation, the amount charged as eligible cost must correspond to the
amount invoiced by the subcontractor.
Specific cases (subcontracting costs (B.)):
Simplified approval procedure (new subcontracts) — If the need for a subcontract was
not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to
introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report (simplified approval
procedure). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting
authority might not approve the new subcontract and reject the costs at interim or final
payment-stage later on.
Subcontracting in actions affecting security or public order (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF) —
If provided for in the call conditions, the simplified approval procedure is NOT allowed and
specific participation conditions and cost eligibility criteria may apply to subcontracting in
actions that concern essential interest of the EU and its Member States.
Subcontracting of action tasks involving classified information — Action tasks
involving EU classified information may ONLY be subcontracted (cumulative conditions):
− to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission) and
− if the granting authority has explicitly approved such requests in writing (see Article
13.2 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
80EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Coordination tasks of the coordinator (e.g. distribution of funds, review of reports and
other tasks listed in Article 7) — Can NOT be subcontracted (they can only be delegated,
under certain circumstances, to an entity with ‘authorisation to administer’ or in the case of
‘sole beneficiaries’ within the meaning of Article 190(2) of the Financial Regulation
2024/250913; see Article 7).
Subcontracting to beneficiaries — Is NOT allowed in the same grant. All beneficiaries
contribute to and are interested in the action; if one beneficiary needs the services of another
in order to perform its part of the work it is the second beneficiary who should declare its
own costs for that work.
Subcontracting to affiliates — Is normally NOT allowed in the same grant. As for
subcontracting between beneficiaries (see above), affiliated entities participating in the action
should declare instead their own cost for that work. Subcontracting to affiliated entities not
participating in the action is possible only exceptionally e.g. in case of monopoly or where
they have a framework contract (affiliate is their usual provider). The subcontracting still
needs to comply with the general and specific cost eligibility conditions, in particular ensure
best value for money or lowest price and avoid any conflict of interest. As best practice, these
affiliates should rather be added to the action, be identified as affiliated entities under Article
8 and declare their own costs for that work.
Subcontracting to associated partners or third parties giving in-kind contributions
— Exceptionally possible, e.g. in case of monopoly or where they have a framework contract
(the associated partner or third party giving in-kind contributions is their usual provider) and
provided that the Annex 1 DoA explains clearly what tasks the participant will perform as
associated partner, or contribute to as third party giving in-kind contributions and what tasks
will be performed as subcontractor (the latter remaining the responsibility of the
subcontracting beneficiary). The subcontracting needs to comply with the general and specific
eligibility conditions, in particular ensure best value for money or lowest price and avoid any
conflict of interest.
Framework contracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if this is
the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of service). In order to be eligible, the
framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money or
lowest price and absence of conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily
have to be concluded before the start of the action.

1. Purchase costs (C.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Purchase costs’.
This budget category covers, depending on the options that apply, the following sub-
categories:
− Travel, accommodation and subsistence (see Article 6.2.C.1)
− Equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2)
− Other goods, works or services, if necessary to implement the action (see Article
6.2.C.3).
Purchase contracts are normally limited in scope. If a contract covers the
implementation of action tasks, this will be considered as a case of subcontracting (see
Article 6.2.B).
1.2 Depending on the provisions in the Grant Agreement, purchase costs must be declared
as actual costs or unit cost (unit cost is provided for travel and subsistence costs for instance
in EMFAF, IMCAP, SMP, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV, JUST, ESF/SOCPL, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, TSI, UCPM).
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred/units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a) and (b))
82EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− be based either on the best value for money (considering the quality of the service,
good or work proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest price
− not be subject to conflict of interest and
− for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ within the
meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24, 2014/25 and
2009/81)14: comply with the applicable national law on public procurement; these
rules normally provide for special procurement procedures for the types of contracts
they cover.
The beneficiaries can in principle freely choose between best value for money and lowest
price.
Best value for money applies the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial
management) to the purchasing context. It does NOT necessarily require competitive
selection procedures. However, if a beneficiary did not request several offers, it must — in
case of a check, review, audit or investigation — be able to show that the price was market-
value and that the criteria defining quality were clear and coherent with the purposes of the
purchase (for detailed guidance, see cost category 6.2.B above).
Selecting the lowest price may be appropriate for automatic award procedures where the
contract is awarded to the company that meets the conditions and quotes the lowest price
(e.g. electronic tendering for consumables).
1.4 The calculation method depends on the type of cost (depreciation, actual or unit cost;
see below).
Specific cases (purchase costs (C.)):
Purchases between participants — Are in principle not accepted. If a beneficiary needs
supplies from another beneficiary, it is the latter beneficiary that should charge them to the
action as cost. (Otherwise there is the risk that the grant is used to charge commercial profit
margins.) Purchases between participants will only be accepted in exceptional and properly
justified cases. For detailed explanations, see the specific cases in Article 6.2.B on
subcontracting between different types of participants.
Framework contracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if this is
the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of goods). In order to be eligible, the
framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money or
lowest price and absence of conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily
have to be concluded before the start of the action.
Providers of research infrastructures services for transnational and virtual access of
users (HE) — The reimbursement of their costs by the beneficiaries will be considered as a
specific purchase of services which will be specified in Annex 1. If (e.g. due to the applicable
national law) an entity providing research infrastructure services cannot issue an invoice to a
beneficiary, but is paid or reimbursed via any other form of transaction, this can be
assimilated to an invoice and accepted as eligible purchase costs.

83EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best value for money can be assured if the providers do not make a profit and their access
costs are calculated according to a well-defined methodology. To this extent, sufficient details
must be provided, such as name of the service providers, purchase costs and object, as well
as the explanation why these service providers are needed and why the purchase costs of the
services are appropriate.
Example: Beneficiaries can explain why these providers of scientific services are necessary for the
action, confirm that they will not include any profit margin when being reimbursed by the
beneficiaries; that they will bear part of the access costs to the research infrastructure (because
some of their costs will not be reimbursed like depreciation costs of their equipments).
Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the granting authority, if they intend to amend the
grant to change a specific purchase of service assessed during proposal evaluation or to
introduce a new specific purchase of service during the action implementation.

[OPTION 1 for programmes without travel and subsistence costs (ineligible):
Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with travel and subsistence costs:
Purchases for travel, accommodation and subsistence must be calculated as follows:
- travel: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line with the
beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as

- accommodation: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line
with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]
- subsistence: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line with
the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]. ]
1. Travel and subsistence costs (actual costs) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the actual cost option (HE, DEP, EDF,
CEF, LIFE, AGRIP, HUMA, RELEX), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Travel and
subsistence costs’ as actual costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘actual costs’ (NOT ‘unit or actual costs’;
see Data Sheet, Point 3).
This budget category covers travels and related accommodation and subsistence allowances
needed for the action. For some programmes, it is specifically broken down in the following
sub-categories:
− Travel
− Accommodation
− Subsistence.
1.2 If the actual costs option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the costs must be
declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.1, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a)) and
− be in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel.
85EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The travels for which costs are claimed must be necessary for the action (e.g. to present a
paper explaining the results at a conference). Travel costs related to an event at which the
beneficiary carried out work that was not specifically related to the action are NOT eligible.
All travel costs must be limited to the needs of the action; costs related to extensions (for
other professional or private reasons) are NOT eligible.
Moreover, they must be adequately recorded.
Costs for breakfast for an overnight stay (if not included in the cost of the hotel room) can be
charged (as subsistence costs) to the action if it is the beneficiary’s normal practice to
reimburse them.
Costs of a combined travel (i.e. where the end point of travel is different from the start) can
be charged to the action ONLY up to the cost that would have been incurred if the travel
would have been made exclusively for the action (i.e. up to the theoretical cost of travelling
directly back to the start point) AND if:
− it is the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay for such travels (e.g. travels combining
professional and personal reasons)
− it has been an actual cost for the beneficiary.
Record-keeping — In the case of combined travel, the beneficiary must keep records of
not only the actual cost of the subsequent travel leg(s), but also of the theoretical direct
return travel after the end of the work for the action in order to prove the cost that would
have been incurred.
If the beneficiary reimburses travel and/or subsistence allowances as a per diem payment, it
is the per diem amount that is considered an eligible cost, NOT the actual prices paid by the
person receiving the per diem. (For the purposes of the grant, these per diem costs remain
actual costs, NOT simplified forms such as unit costs). They must be recorded in the
beneficiary’s accounts and will be checked if there is an audit.
1.4 There is no specific calculation method; the costs must correspond to the eligible costs
actually incurred (amounts paid for the travel, accommodation and subsistence).
Best practice: Beneficiaries that have special/atypical/particularly expensive travel plans
should contact the granting authority for advice.
Record-keeping — In terms of record-keeping, the beneficiary must keep evidence of the
actual costs incurred as well as evidence that the instance of travel fulfils the general eligibility
conditions for actual costs (for example that the travel was linked to the action).
2. Travel and subsistence costs (unit costs) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
2.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the unit cost option (most
programmes, e.g. I3, ERDF-TA, IMREG, EMFAF, IMCAP, SMP, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV, JUST,
ESF/SOCPL, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, EUAF, CUST/FISC, PERI (partial), TSI, UCPM), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Travel and subsistence costs’ as unit costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘unit or actual costs’ (NOT ‘actual
costs’; see Data Sheet, Point 3).
86EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This budget category covers travels needed for the action, broken down in the following sub-
categories:
− Travel
− Accommodation
− Subsistence.
2.2 If the unit cost option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the costs must be declared
using the unit cost fixed by the authorising decision C(2021)3515 and set out in Annex 2a.
Which unit cost? Check the opening date of your call — the unit costs that you must use
for your grant will always depend on the date on which the call for proposals was opened.
Land travel’ means:
- for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: trips between 50 and 399 km by any
form of land-based travel (bus, rail or car) and trips above 400km by rail
- for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: trips between 50 and 399 km by any
form of land-based travel, and trips between 400 and 600 km by rail.
Travel below 50km will not be reimbursed using the travel unit costs. Such costs can be
reimbursed using actual costs, if it is the usual practice of the beneficiary to reimburse such
short-distance travel.
If a particular instance of travel, accommodation or subsistence in the action is not covered
by one of the unit costs mentioned in the authorising decision C(2021)35, actual costs may
be used (in same way as ‘Travel and subsistence as actual costs’ above).
In practice, this is usually the case for:
− travel between 50 and 399km in a non-EU country
− travel between 50 and 399km between a Member State and a non-EU country (except
for land-based travel between Member States and bordering countries for calls with
opening date as from 31 July 2024)
− land travel between 50 and 399km in LU, CY or MT
− ferry or boat travel from island to island or island to mainland
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: land travel above 400 km or above
600 km where specific unit costs for distances between 400 and 600 km are provided
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: journeys less than 400 km which
necessitate air travel because land travel is not possible or appropriate (see specific
case below).
The amounts per unit are prefixed by the authorising decision.
2.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.1, in
particular:
15 Commission Decision of 12 January 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for travel, accommodation and
subsistence costs under an action or work programme under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework
(C(2021)35) as amended by Commission Decision C(2023)4928 of 26.07.2023.
87EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be purchased for the action and in accordance with Article 6.2.C.
2.4 The costs must be calculated, for each travel and person travelling, in accordance with
the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
Regarding travel:
The formulas for calculating the travel are:
- for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024:
− by air above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x number of journeys}
− by rail above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x number of journeys}
− combined air and rail above 400 km: {amount depending on distance band x number of
journeys}
− land travel (50 – 399km) in 1 Member State: {amount for intra-Member State x number of
journeys}
− land travel (50-399km) between 2 Member States: {amount for inter-Member State travel
x number of journeys}
− travel between EU and one of EU’s outermost regions and overseas countries and territories
(OCTs)5: {specific unit cost for that OCT x number of journeys}
− journey of less than 400 km not covered by land transport (e.g. Helsinki/Tallinn): {unit
cost for air travel (400-600 km) x number of journeys}
− travel to/from places more than 400 km from a primary airport (e.g. certain regions in
Finland): {relevant unit cost for air travel x 150% number of journeys}
- for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024:
– by air or combined air and rail above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x
number of journeys}
– land travel in 1 Member State (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600k where relevant): {amount for
intra-Member State x number of journeys}
– land travel between 2 Member States (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600k where relevant):
{amount for inter-Member State travel x number of journeys}
– land travel between a Member State and a bordering country (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600
km where relevant): {amount for Member State and specific connection x number of
journeys}
All unit costs are an amount to cover a return trip. However, the calculation of the distance
should be done on the basis of the 1-way distance between the points.
For calculating the ‘distance’ between two points for land or air travel, beneficiaries must
use the distance calculators available on the Europa website.
88EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Enter start and end points of your travel. Do NOT enter intermediate stops, transfer
locations etc.
The distance calculators are mandatory. The distance produced by the calculators is the
only distance that can be used for the calculation of the unit costs — even if this does not
correspond to the actual distance of the travel.
Example: For example, the land travel calculator defines the distance between towns A and B as 380
km. However, because the train line deviates slightly to also serve town C, the actual distance travelled
is 410 km. For the purposes of the unit cost, only the distance of 380 km between towns A and B is
relevant (as calculated by the distance calculator).
The start and end-points entered will normally be the place of employment of the person and
the location of the meeting.
If, following the event, the person will travel to a place other than the start point, the amount
to be declared will be the theoretical cost of returning to the same starting point, unless the
different destination is necessary for the implementation of the action. In that case, the unit
cost can be calculated using the longer of the distances (e.g. if travel from Dublin – Brussels
– Athens is justified for the action, the unit cost to be applied can be calculated on basis of
the longer flight from Brussels – Athens).
Where the trip involves 3 journeys and is necessary for the implementation of the action (e.g.
Madrid – Brussels – Berlin – Madrid), the unit costs can be calculated on the basis of 2
separate return flights: Madrid – Brussels and Berlin – Madrid.
For checking the distance of travel to/from places more than 400km from a primary airport,
the following are the ‘primary airports’ to be used (— only relevant for calls with opening
date before 31 July 2024; for calls as from 31 July 2024, primary airports are no longer
relevant and instead the amount is determined solely by calculating the distance in the
normal way using the distance calculator):

Regarding accommodation:
The formula for calculating the accommodation is:
{amount per unit [depending on country]}
multiplied by
{nights spent on travel}
For the EU’s outermost regions or OCTs, the rate for the relevant Member State can be used
as a proxy amount (— only relevant for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024; for calls
with opening date as from 31 July 2024, specific unit costs for each OCT apply).
90EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, bear in mind that a new and extended list of
countries has been published in Annex 2a, and that this list contains a number of countries that
were not included in the list for previous calls.
Moreover, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is a specific unit cost for
’other countries’ that are not specifically mentioned in the list. Therefore, in practice there is now
a relevant unit cost to reimburse accommodation costs for any country in the world.
Regarding subsistence:
The formula for calculating the subsistence is:
{amount per unit [depending on country]}
multiplied by
{days spent on travel}
Subsistence unit costs are for a 24-hour period. The amount of unit costs to be declared
should be calculated by rounding up or down to the nearest full number of days, except for
the first day where any amount of hours will be rounded up to 1 full day.
For the EU’s outermost regions or OCTs, the rate for the relevant Member State can be used
as a proxy amount (— only relevant for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024; for calls
with opening date as from 31 July 2024, specific unit costs for each OCT apply).
The subsistence unit costs is intended to cover meals and other incidental expenses.
However, it is not necessary to verify whether the person already received a meal free of cost
(for example, a meal provided by the meeting/conference organiser or breakfast included in
the associated hotel amount; this does not impact the amount paid for the subsistence unit
cost).
For calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, bear in mind that a new and extended list of
countries has been published in Annex 2a, and that this list contains a number of countries that
were not included in the list for previous calls.
Moreover, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is a specific unit cost for
’other countries’ that are not specifically mentioned in the list. Therefore, in practice there is now
a relevant unit cost to reimburse subsistence costs for any country in the world.
Record-keeping — As regards record-keeping, the beneficiaries will have to be able to
prove (upon request) that an instance of travel took place and was linked to the action. The
beneficiaries do not need to keep specific records on the actual costs incurred, but must keep
adequate records and supporting documents to prove the number of units declared (see Article
20).
Example: Documents with a dated attendance list and description of the meeting can demonstrate that the
travel took place, was necessary for the action and occurred during the action duration. To be able to identify
the unit cost of each travel, the beneficiary could indicate on the attendance list the place of departure of the
persons for whom travel costs are claimed. In case of an event with no attendance list (a smaller/informal
meeting or event organised by a third party), the beneficiary must keep evidence to demonstrate that the
person travelled and that it was linked to the action: the agenda, email invitation, the minutes or report of
the event, the boarding pass, travel ticket, etc.
Specific cases (Travel and subsistence (C.1)):
Travel and subsistence for persons other than personnel (e.g. conference speakers,
visiting experts) (actual or unit cost) — Travel and subsistence costs may also be eligible
for persons that participate in the action on an ad-hoc basis (e.g. attending specific
91EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
meetings), if this complies with the general and specific eligibility conditions in Article 6.1 and
6.2.C, in particular being necessary for the implementation of the action, and:
− their participation is foreseen in Annex 1, or
− their participation is specifically justified in the periodic technical report and approved
by the granting authority (simplified approval procedure).
In line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel, the beneficiary may purchase itself or
reimburse these persons.
Carbon-offsetting (actual cost only) — Costs associated with carbon offsetting measures
can be eligible if they are in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel (not just for
the EU action) and fulfil the general and specific cost eligibility conditions (e.g. incurred
during the action duration, in connection with the action as described in Annex 1 and the
underlying travel is necessary for the action’s implementation).
Air travel below 400 km (unit cost only) — Air travel below 400km is in principle not
reimbursed (participants are expected to use land travel for such distances and can charge
such land travel costs).
However, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is some flexibility to
reimburse air travel below 400km on the basis of actual costs incurred where land travel
would be not possible or appropriate. This may, for instance, be the case:
- where land travel is not available for a particular route (for example, travel from an
island to another island or from an island to the mainland)
- where land travel would involve an unusually long length of time (for example, an
anticipated journey time of seven hours or more (‘door to door’) for a one-way trip of
less than 399 km if there is a direct route by air travel as an alternative)
- where land travel is normally available but, due to unforeseen events, not available at
the time (for example, works on a train line meaning the train connection is cancelled;
proof of such circumstances should be kept on file).
Best practice: Beneficiaries who have queries in specific cases should contact the granting
authority (ideally before the travel is undertaken, but at the very latest before the costs are
submitted at the end of a reporting period). Costs for air travel for distances below 400 km
which have not been agreed with the granting authority may be rejected or adjusted to the
equivalent costs for land travel.
Travel by car (unit cost only) — Car travel below 50 km is NEVER eligible for
reimbursement using unit costs. However, it could be reimbursed using costs actually
incurred, where this is in line with the usual practices of the beneficiary.
For distances between 50 and 399 km, travel by car can be reimbursed as a form of land
travel (i.e. using the applicable ‘land travel’ unit costs).
For travel above 400 km, the situation depends on the call opening date:
− for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: car travel can NOT be reimbursed
using unit costs, but could be reimbursed on the basis of costs actually incurred,
where this is in line with the usual practices of the beneficiary
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: reimbursement of car travel above
400km using unit costs is possible where the travel took place in one of the land travel
connections for land travel between 50 and 399 km covered by authorising decision
C(2021)35; if there is no such land travel connection, then costs can be reimbursed
using costs actually incurred, where in line with and allowed by the beneficiaries usual
practices.
92EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
No matter the actual distance travelled, the reimbursement is limited to the unit cost for
land travel between 50 and 399 km.
Example: For example, a person drives from Frankfurt in Germany to Bern in Switzerland – a distance
of 420 km. Since there are unit costs for distances of 50 – 399 km for land travel between Germany and
Switzerland, this travel can be reimbursed with a unit cost amount of EUR 66. If the connection by car is
not covered by authorising decision C(2021)35, then costs can be reimbursed using costs actually
incurred, where in line with and allowed by the beneficiaries usual practices.
Destinations with different distances in the flight- and land travel calculators (e.g.
the flight calculator shows a distance below 400 km but the land travel calculator shows a
distance of more than 400km) (unit cost only) — In the unit cost system, reimbursement of
air travel is only possible where the travel is more than 400km, as calculated by the flight
calculator. Therefore, if the flight calculator shows a distance of 390 km, the travel costs can
NOT be reimbursed using the air travel unit costs.
Instead, the amounts to be claimed for this travel should be calculated according to the rules
for land travel. Thus, if for instance the land travel calculator shows a distance of 440 km, the
travel must be reimbursed using the relevant rules for land-based travel, i.e.:
− for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: using the unit costs set out in Annex
2a for air, rail or combined air/rail (see table ’for travel of 400 km or more (air or rail
or combined air/rail)’)
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: using unit costs if there is a
corresponding unit cost for that travel (for example, land travel of 400 – 600 km
within France, or between Belgium and France, or between Germany and
Switzerland); if there is no applicable unit cost for that travel, then it can be
reimbursed on the basis of costs actually incurred.

1. Equipment costs (depreciation costs) (C.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility
conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the depreciation option (default option
for most programmes), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Equipment costs’ as
depreciation costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘depreciation only’ (NOT ‘depreciation
and full cost for listed equipment’ or ‘full cost and depreciation for listed equipment’; see
Data Sheet, Point 3). For those other options, see specific cases below.
In this case, this budget category covers the depreciation costs of equipment, infrastructure
or other assets used for the action. In addition, in some cases (e.g. infrastructure), it may
also include the costs necessary to ensure that the asset is ready for its intended use (e.g.
site preparation, delivery and handling, installation, etc).
What not? If the beneficiary’s usual practice is to consider durable equipment costs (or
some of them) as indirect costs, these can NOT be declared as direct costs, but are covered
by the flat rate for indirect costs (see Article 6.2.E). Any depreciation declared as a direct
cost under the action must be a direct cost under the beneficiary’s cost accounting practices
(see Article 6.2).
1.2 The costs must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.2, in
particular:
97EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts,
etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C and
− be written off in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual accounting practices and with
international accounting standards.
‘International accounting standards’ are an internationally recognised set of rules for
maintaining books and reporting company accounts, designed to be compared and
understood across countries.
Example: The IAS 16 (International Accounting Standards) or the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), originally created by the EU and now in common international use.
1.4 They must be calculated according to the following principles:
− the depreciable amount (purchase price) of the equipment must be allocated on a
systematic basis over its useful life (i.e. the period during which the equipment is
expected to be usable). If the equipment’s useful life is more than a year, the
beneficiary can NOT charge the total cost of the item in a single year
‘Useful life’ means the time during which the equipment is useful for the beneficiary. If
the beneficiary does not normally calculate depreciation, it may refer to its national
tax regulations to define the useful life of the equipment.
Declaring the full price in one single year would be considered either as not compliant
with the international accounting standards or as an excessive cost — and therefore in
both cases ineligible; see specific case ‘cash-based accounting’ below), except in case of
low-value assets (see below).
− depreciated equipment costs can NOT exceed the equipment’s purchase price
− if the beneficiary does not use the equipment exclusively for the action, only the
portion used on the action may be charged (the amount of use must be auditable)
Example:
A large 3D printer was bought before the action started and was not fully depreciated. For 6
months in reporting period 1 it was used for the action for 50 % of the time and for other
activities for the other 50 % of the time. Linear depreciation is applied according to the
beneficiary’s usual practices (depreciation over the expected period of use of the 3D printer):
EUR 100 000 per year (EUR 50 000 for 6 months).
Costs declared for the project: EUR 50 000 (6 months of use) multiplied by 50 % of use for the
action during those 6 months = EUR 25 000.
− the beneficiary can charge depreciation in line with applicable audit standards and its
usual accounting practices, i.e. normally at the earliest for periods as of the reception
of the equipment and its availability for use (i.e. when it is in the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management).
Example: A robot-supported equipment was bought on 15 November and received and set up
for use as of 01 December. The reporting period ends on 31 December and the financial year
also ends on 31 December. The maximum depreciation that the beneficiary may charge is 1
month (from 1 to 31 December); i.e. 1/12 of the annual depreciation. This applies even if the
beneficiary recorded in its accounts at 31 December a full year of depreciation for the item.
The depreciation costs must be calculated for each reporting period.
2. Equipment costs (full cost) (C.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
98EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the full cost option (sometimes in HE,
RFCS, DEP, EDF, SMP, EU4H, EUAF, UCPM, RELEX; always in CEF, CCEI, HUMA), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Equipment costs’ as full costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘full cost only’ (NOT ‘depreciation and
full cost for listed equipment’ or ‘full cost and depreciation for listed equipment’; see Data
Sheet, Point 3). For those other options, see specific cases below.
Equipment that does not comply with the specific conditions for full cost (e.g. equipment
purchased prior to the action but used for the action) must be declared using the normal
depreciation cost.
In this case, the equipment costs cover the full capitalised costs for the equipment,
infrastructure or other assets to the grant.
‘Capitalised’ costs means recorded as assets in the beneficiary’s balance sheet. They may
relate to:
− the full purchase costs and/or
− the full development costs
and must be recorded under a fixed asset account in the beneficiary’s accounting records in
compliance with international accounting standards and the beneficiary’s usual cost
accounting practices.
2.2 The costs must be declared as actual costs.
2.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.2, in
particular:
− for full purchase costs:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts,
etc; see Article 6.1(a)) and
− have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C
Example: A beneficiary needs to buy an off-the-shelf equipment to perform some of its action
tasks. The related purchase costs are eligible if they comply with Article 6.2.C (i.e. ‘best value
for money/or lowest price’ and ‘no conflict of interests’ principles).
− for full development costs:
− depending on the nature of the cost items included in the development cost, fulfil the
general and specific cost eligibility conditions that would apply to the individual cost
item (for example, have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C or fulfil the
specific conditions for personnel costs to be eligible Article 6.2.A).
Example:
A beneficiary is developing a prototype as part of its action tasks. For this purpose, it needs to
buy several components and rely on a service provider to assemble some specific parts of the
prototype. In that case, the related purchase costs are eligible if they comply with Article 6.2.C
(i.e. notably with the ‘best value for money/ or lowest price’ and ‘no conflict of interests’
principles).
The beneficiary has also its own employees involved in the assembling of the other parts of the
prototype. In that case, the related personnel costs are eligible if they comply with Article
6.2.A.1 (personnel costs for employees or equivalent appointing act).
2.4 They must be calculated according to the following principles:
99EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− correspond to the actual costs incurred in the purchase or for the development and
− ensure that there is no double charging of costs (in particular, no charging of
depreciation costs for the prototype or pilot plant to the grant or another EU grant).
They cover the full purchase/development costs (not only the depreciation costs for the
reporting period).
Specific cases (equipment costs (C.2)):
Depreciation and full costs for listed items (option in HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, SMP,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI, PERI, UCPM, RELEX) — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement,
the beneficiaries can use depreciation for all items, except certain items listed in the Grant
Agreement for which you can charge full cost. For details, see above.
Full costs and depreciation for listed items (option in HE, RFCS, EDF, LIFE, SMP, UCPM)
— If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries may charge all items at
full cost, except the ones listed in the Grant Agreement for which you need to use
depreciation. For details, see above.
Full price of a low-value asset in one single year (depreciation) — If the option for
depreciation is activated, full cost of a low-value asset may exceptionally be eligible in the
year when it is purchased if:
− the full cost is recorded in the accounts of the entity in accordance with its usual
accounting practices as expenditure of that year (i.e. NOT recorded as an asset
subject to depreciation)
− the cost of the asset is below the low-value ceiling as defined under national law (e.g.
national tax legislation) or other objective reference compatible with the materiality
principle
and
− the item is used exclusively for the action in the year of purchase.
If the item is not used exclusively for the action in the year of purchase, only the portion
used on the action may be charged.
Equipment bought before the action starting date (depreciation) — If the option for
depreciation is activated, depreciation costs for equipment used for the action, but bought
before the action starting date are eligible if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions of
Article 6.1(a). The remaining depreciation costs (the equipment has not been fully
depreciated before the action’s start) may be eligible for the portion corresponding to the
action duration and to the rate of actual use for the purposes of the action.
Example: According to the beneficiary’s accounting practices, a piece of equipment bought in
January 2020 has a depreciation period of 48 months. If the action starts in January 2022 (when
24 months of depreciation have already passed) and the equipment is used for this action, the
beneficiary can declare the depreciation costs incurred for the remaining 24 months, in proportion
to the equipment’s use for the action.
Cash-based accounting — There are NO exceptions for cash-based accounting. If the
option for depreciation is activated, also beneficiaries with cash-based accounting may only
charge the annual depreciation costs that correspond to the part of the equipment’s use for
the action.They can NOT charge the full price in one single year — even if their usual
accounting practice is to record the equipment’s total purchase costs as an expense in one
year.
Example:
A beneficiary that uses cash-based accounting buys a machine for EUR 100 000 in March 2021.
According to the logbook of the machine, it is used for the action 50 % of the time from 1 July 2021
100EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
until the end of the action. The action started in January 2021 and runs for three years with two
reporting periods. The machine’s useful life is six years.
In the reporting period ending in June 2022, the beneficiary must declare depreciation costs taking
into account the percentage of use, the time used for the action and the machine’s useful life:
EUR 100 000 x (12/72 months) x 50 % (used for the action) = amount declared for the machine
in the first reporting period
In the reporting period ending in December 2023, the beneficiary must declare:
EUR 100 000 x (18/72 months) x 50 % (used for the action) = amount declared for the machine
in the second reporting period
Costs of renting or leasing of equipment, infrastructure or other assets
(depreciation and full cost) — If the equipment was not purchased but rented or leased,
the beneficiaries can charge the renting or leasing costs (i.e. finance leasing, renting and
operational leasing) — both if the option for depreciation or the full cost option are activated,
The costs must comply with the general and specific eligibility conditions (see Article 6.1(a)
and Article 6.2.C). The costs must be calculated according to the following principles :
− they must correspond to the actual eligible costs incurred for the renting or leasing
− they must not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment, infrastructure or
assets
− they must not include any financing fees (e.g. finance charges included in the finance
lease payments or interests on loans taken to finance the purchase)
− there must be no double charging of costs (e.g. no charging of depreciation costs for
equipment previously funded at full cost by an EU grant)
− where the Grant Agreement provides for depreciation: if equipment is not used
exclusively for the action, only the portion used on the action may be charged (the
amount of use must be auditable)
− where the Grant Agreement provides for full cost: in principle the full rental or lease
cost can be charged, irrespective of the portion used on the action. However, the cost
still cannot exceed depreciation costs of similar equipment/infrastructure/assets that
need to be determined based on the duration of the action (i.e. if you enter into a 5-
year lease at the start of a 3-year action, you may only charge cost up to the amount
of depreciation for three years).

C.3 Other goods, works and services
[OPTION 1 for programmes without costs for other goods, works and services (ineligible):
Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with costs for other goods, works and services (standard):
Purchases of other goods, works and services must be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred.
Such goods, works and services include, for instance, consumables and supplies, promotion, dissemination,
protection of results, translations, publications, certificates and financial guarantees, if required under the
Agreement. ]
1. Costs of other goods, works and services (C.3): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge other purchases as ‘Other goods, works and
services’.
This budget category covers the costs for goods and services that were purchased for the
action, such as:
− costs for consumables and supplies (e.g. raw materials, office supplies)
− communication and dissemination costs (e.g. translation and printing costs or graphic
designer fees for printed products such as leaflets or other promotional items in
relation to communication activities; conference fees; costs for speakers and
interpreters)
− costs related to intellectual property rights (IPR) (e.g. costs related to protecting the
results such as consulting fees or fees paid to patent offices)
− costs for certificates on financial statements (CFS) and certificates on methodology
(CoMUC; where necessary)
− costs for financial guarantees (only if required by the granting authority; see Data
Sheet, Point 4.2).
Best practice: If there is any doubt about whether a cost is eligible, or whether a cost is to be
considered a purchase cost for other goods, works and services, the beneficiaries should
contact the granting authority.
What not? If it is the beneficiary’s usual accounting practice to consider some of these costs
(or all of them) as indirect costs, they cannot be declared as direct costs.
1.2 Costs of other goods, works and services must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.3, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a)) and
102EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− be purchased specifically for the action and in accordance with Article 6.2.C.
1.4. Regarding the calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible costs actually
incurred (i.e. the amount paid by the beneficiary for the supply of the goods, works or
services).
Specific cases (costs for other goods, works and services (D.3)):
Supplies in stock — Supplies and consumables which were already in the stock of the
beneficiary may be eligible as a direct cost, if they are used for the action and fit the
definition of direct costs under Article 6.2.
Self-produced consumables with an accounting value in the inventory of the
beneficiary (i.e. not internally invoiced costs for goods and services) — Consumables that
are manufactured (produced) by the beneficiary itself do not have a purchase price; the cost
of production for the beneficiary is however normally recorded in the accounts of the
beneficiary (as part of the inventory). Therefore, the eligible costs of self-produced
consumables must be determined on the basis of its accounting value under the following
conditions:
− only the direct costs within the accounting value of the consumable (cost of
production) may be charged
and
− the amount resulting from the indent above may not be significantly higher than the
market price of the consumable.
Beneficiaries can NOT charge the commercial price of their self-produced consumables,
since it is not allowed to include a profit.
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — Costs for staff provided by a temporary
work agency are eligible normally under category C.3 Other goods and services if they
comply with the eligibility conditions (and unless the temporary work agency carries out
directly some task of the action, in which case it can be considered as subcontracting and
should be declared under category B. Subcontracting).
Communication and dissemination plans — The eligibility of costs for communication and
dissemination plans (e.g. HE plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results) depends
on their timing. Costs for the drawing up of plans that must be submitted together with the
proposal are normally NOT eligible since they will have been incurred before the start of the
action, to prepare the proposal. Costs for plans that are required only later or that occur
when revising or implementing the plan may be eligible if the eligibility conditions are
fulfilled.
Protection of results — Costs related to the protection of the action’s results may be
eligible if the eligibility conditions are fulfilled. However, costs related to protection of other
intellectual property (e.g. background patents) are NOT eligible.
IPR access rights (HE) — Royalties paid for IPR access rights (and by extension any lump
sum payments) may be eligible costs provided that all the eligibility conditions are fulfilled
(e.g. necessary for the implementation of the action, incurred during the action, reasonable,
etc).
The following are however NOT eligible (or eligible only within certain limits):
− royalties for an exclusive licence: are eligible only if it can be shown that the
exclusivity (and thus the higher royalties) is absolutely necessary for the
implementation of the action
103EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− royalties for licensing agreements which were already in force before the start of the
action: only the part of the licence fee that can be linked to the action is eligible (since
the licence presumably goes beyond the action implementation)
− royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries for
implementing the action: since the default rule is that access rights are granted on a
royalty-free basis and beneficiaries may deviate only if agreed before grant signature,
royalties may be eligible only if explicitly agreed by all beneficiaries before grant
signature
Best practice: If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is
recommended that this is explained in detail in their proposal.
− royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries for exploiting
the results and by extension royalties paid to third parties for exploitation of the
results: are NOT eligible.
Costs related to research output management (HE) — Costs for research output
management (e.g. management of research data) are eligible if the eligibility conditions are
fulfilled, including open access to peer-reviewed publications (but see the additional eligibility
condition referenced immediately below), research data and other outputs.
Open access to scientific publications (HE) — In addition to fulfilling the other costs
eligibility criteria, publication fees are ONLY eligible when publishing in full open access
publishing venues (see Annex 5 > Communication, dissemination and visibility).

105EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 6.2.D.1 > Financial support to third parties
D.1 Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (all programmes except RFCS,SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM)
D.1 Financial support to third parties
Costs for providing financial support to third parties (in the form of grants, prizes or similar forms of
support; if any) are eligible, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions, are calculated [on the basis of the costs actually incurred][as unit costs in accordance
with the method set out in Annex 2a] and the support is implemented in accordance with the conditions set
out in Annex 1.
These conditions must ensure objective and transparent selection procedures and include at least the
following:
(a) for grants (or similar):
(i) the maximum amount of financial support for each third party (‘recipient’); this amount
may not exceed the amount set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 3)30 or otherwise agreed
with the granting authority
(ii) the criteria for calculating the exact amount of the financial support
(iii) the different types of activity that qualify for financial support, on the basis of a closed list
(iv) the persons or categories of persons that will be supported and
(v) the criteria and procedures for giving financial support
(b) for prizes (or similar):
(i) the eligibility and award criteria
(ii) the amount of the prize and
(iii) the payment arrangements.
[This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate.]]
30 The amount must be specified in the call. It may not be more than 60 000 EUR, unless the objective of the action would otherwise be
impossible or overly difficult or in the case of humanitarian aid, emergency support operations, civil protection operations, or crisis
management aid (Article 207 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
1. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except RFCS, SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM) AND provided for in the call conditions, the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs under ‘Financial support to third parties
(FSTP)’, where giving such support is part of the action activities.
This budget category covers ‘cascading’ grants, prizes or similar (meaning where the
beneficiaries of the EU grant cascade down (part of) the financial contribution to third parties,
so-called ‘recipients’).
For some programmes, the specific cost category in Article 6 is complemented by specific
rules in Annex 5 for carrying out the action within the meaning of Article 18 (see Annex 5 >
HE Co-funded Partnerships).
106EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Financial support to third parties may be given to natural persons (e.g. allowance,
scholarship, fellowship) or legal persons (e.g. non-repayable financial assistance to local
NGOs), seed money to start-ups or microcredit, or other forms. Also prizes can be given on
the basis of a contest organised by the beneficiary.
Examples:
1. An action in the area of sustainable agriculture and forestry includes financial support for
end-users (farmers) testing the technology developed within the action.
2. One of the work packages in Annex 1 includes funding for awarding three scholarships in the field
of the action.
3. A prize announced at the beginning of the action for identifying a (new) approach to dealing with
a technical implementation problem to be tackled at the end of the action.
4. A grant is given to a beneficiary foreseeing that the beneficiary should fund local NGOs which in
turn provide food vouchers and microcredits to natural persons in third countries.
The financial support scheme itself is NOT an EU action; the beneficiaries are providing the
financial support in their own name and under their own responsibility. When promoting the
EU action (see Article 17), the financial support must therefore NOT be presented as directly
provided by the EU.
What not? Support in kind (e.g. transfer of material for free) by the beneficiary to a third
party is NOT considered financial support.
This cost category can only cover financial support. By contrast, cost for non-financial
support or support given in-kind (e.g. vouchers) must be declared under other categories (e.g. as
cost for purchases of vouchers).
The recipients are NOT party to the Grant Agreement and therefore do NOT need to be listed
nor be registered in the Participant Register.
1.2 Costs of financial support to third parties must normally be declared as actual costs (or,
very exceptionally, as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a —
currently only for SMP COSME EYE and ERDF-TA IVY).
1.3 The actual costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.1,
in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− respect the maximum amount of financial support to third parties as set out in the
description of the action (DoA; Annex 1) — normally up to EUR 60 000 per recipient,
but higher amounts are possible if necessary for the objectives of the action and
agreed with the granting authority (in the call conditions/Grant Agreement)
Systematic exceptions are foreseen for specific types of funding, such as humanitarian
aid, emergency support operations, civil protection operations, or crisis management aid
(see Article 207 FR 2024/2509).
and
− comply with the other conditions for the support that are set out in Annex 1, and in
particular:
− for cascading grants (or similar):
− the maximum amount per third party
107EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the criteria for determining the exact amount of financial support (e.g. EUR
2 000 per hectare; EUR 30 000 per student for a two-year scholarship)
Unless otherwise specified in the Grant Agreement, the financial support
provided by the beneficiaries may take any form (e.g. a lump sum or the
reimbursement of the costs incurred by the recipients when implementing the
supported activities); for the purposes of the EU grant, these remain however
actual costs.
− a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial
support for third parties (e.g. financial support for third parties allowed for
technology-testing activities)
These activities should benefit, primarily, the recipients (NOT the
beneficiaries).
− the persons or category(ies) of persons that may receive it (e.g. farmers; PhD
students, SMEs)
The procedures for selecting the recipients should be described in Annex 1.
− the criteria for giving financial support (e.g. physical characteristics of the
agricultural plots which make them suitable for the purpose of the action).
These criteria should respond to the objectives set out in the call conditions.
− for prizes:
− the amount of the prize (e.g. EUR 10 000)
− a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial
support to third parties and the award criteria for assessing the quality of
entries in light of the objectives and expected results
− the conditions for participation and the conditions for cancellation of the
contest, if any (e.g. eligibility and exclusion criteria; deadline for submission of
entries; possibility of jury interview)
The criteria must be objective.
− the payment arrangements (usually one payment).
− for other forms of financial support to third parties, at least:
− the maximum amount per recipient
− the criteria for determining the exact amount
− the types of activities to be funded
− the types of recipients eligible.
These conditions must also already be part of the proposal.
108EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The FSTP conditions (type of activities, eligible countries, etc) may have to follow similar
principles as those that apply to the beneficiaries themselves under the EU grant, if this is
provided in the call conditions (of the EU grant). These conditions must then also be specified in
the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1). Unless otherwise provided for in the call conditions,
financial support to third parties needs to be given directly from the EU grant beneficiary to the
(final) recipients, without further intermediaries.
The specific cost category in Article 6 is, for some programmes (HE, DEP, HUMA etc),
complemented by specific rules in Annex 5 for carrying out the action within the meaning of
Article 18.
1.4. Regarding the actual cost calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible costs
actually incurred (i.e. the amounts paid by the beneficiary for the cascading grants, prizes or
similar to the third parties during the duration of the action).
Specific cases (FSTP (D.1)):
(Micro)Loans and other financial instruments — If a call allows financial support to third
parties, directly or via implementing partners, in repayable form such as (micro)loans or
other financial instruments with a long-term character that exceed by their nature the
duration of the action and the EU Grant Agreement, Annex 1 must provide for specific
conditions on cost eligibility and acceptance.
For general guidance on financial support to third parties, see Guidance on good practices for
implementing FSTP in EU grants.

General > Article 6.2.D.2 > Internally invoiced goods and services
D.2 Internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF)
D.2 Internally invoiced goods and services
Costs for internally invoiced goods and services directly used for the action may be declared as unit cost
according to usual cost accounting practices, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions for such unit costs and the amount per unit is calculated:
(a) using the actual costs for the good or service recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts, attributed either
by direct measurement or on the basis of cost drivers, and excluding any cost which are ineligible or
already included in other budget categories; the actual costs may be adjusted on the basis of
budgeted or estimated elements, if they are relevant for calculating the costs, reasonable and
correspond to objective and verifiable information
and
(b) according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner, based on
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
‘Internally invoiced goods and services’ means goods or services which are provided within the beneficiary’s
organisation directly for the action and which the beneficiary values on the basis of its usual cost accounting
practices.
[This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate.]
1. Internally invoiced goods and services (D.2): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (HE, DEP and EDF), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs under ‘Internally invoiced goods and
services’.
This budget category covers the costs for goods and services that the beneficiary itself
produced or provided for the action. They may include (non-exhaustive list):
− self-produced consumables (e.g. electronic wafers, chemicals)
− use of specific devices or facilities needed for the action (e.g. clean room, wind tunnel,
supercomputer facilities, electronic microscope, animal house, greenhouse, aquarium)
− standardised testing or research and development processes (e.g. genomic test, mass
spectrometry analysis)
− hosting services for visiting project team members participating in the action (e.g.
housing, canteen).
What not? Costs of goods or services purchased and costs of goods or services internally
invoiced which are not directly used for the action (e.g. supporting services like cleaning,
general accountancy, administrative support, etc).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs in accordance with usual cost accounting
practices. The usual cost accounting practices must define both the unit (e.g. hour of use of
wind tunnel, one genomic test, one electronic wafer fabricated internally, etc) and the
methodology to determine the cost of the unit.
It is NOT necessary to have a document called ‘internal invoice’ to support these costs, but
the beneficiary should have a documented methodology how to determine them (such a
110EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
methodology must be part of its usual costs accounting practices). The beneficiary must also
keep supporting evidence of the use of the good or service for the action and showing the
number of units used.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.2, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary for the action, identifiable and verifiable, etc; see Article
6.1(b))
− be in line with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices and
− the cost accounting practices must have been applied in a consistent manner, based
on objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
It must be the usual practice of the beneficiary to calculate a unit cost for that good or
service. The unit costs is the internal cost per unit that is charged between departments of
the same entity; it is not the price charged in the context of commercial sales or to grants
from other fund providers.
The beneficiary must consistently apply its usual cost accounting practices to calculate the
unit cost, based on objective criteria that must be verifiable if there is a check, audit, review
or investigation. You must do this no matter who is funding the action.
Example (ineligible): If you set up a new unit cost which applies only to EU actions, the
internally invoiced costs based on that new unit cost would be ineligible as they would not be your
usual cost accounting practice.
Example (eligible): If you make adjustments to comply with the Grant Agreement because the
usual methodology includes an ineligible cost item, the adjusted methodology will still be
considered as your usual cost accounting practice and not as a new unit cost.
1.4 The costs must be calculated using the actual costs recorded in the beneficiary’s
accounts, excluding any ineligible costs or costs already included in other budget categories:
− if necessary, the unit cost must be adjusted to remove:
− cost elements that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (even if they are
part of the beneficiary’s usual methodology for determining the unit cost for its
internal invoices)
Example: The beneficiary uses internal invoices for the use of an electronic microscope
based on a unit cost per hour of use. The methodology to calculate the unit cost
includes costs of capital (e.g. interest charged by the bank for a loan used to buy the
microscope). Those costs are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (see Article 6.3) and
must therefore be removed. The unit cost must be recalculated without them.
You can NOT simply apply an estimated percentage of deduction on the amount
of your internal invoices to remove ineligible costs. You have to ensure that the
internal invoice does not include any ineligible costs.
− costs of resources that do not belong to the beneficiary and which it uses free
of charge (e.g. personnel or equipment of a third party provided free of
charge), because those costs are not in its accounts (see Article 6.1(a)(v))
− costs that are already included in other budget categories (double funding of
the same costs, see Article 6.1(a)(i))
Example: The beneficiary uses internal invoices for water chemistry analyses, based on
a unit cost per water sample analysed. The methodology to calculate the unit cost
includes the cost of the staff carrying out the analysis. However, the costs for those
111EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
persons are already charged to the action under direct personnel costs (category A.1).
The cost of the staff must therefore be removed and the unit cost must be recalculated
without them.
− if budgeted or estimated elements were included in the calculation of the amount per
unit, those elements must:
− be relevant (i.e. clearly related to invoiced item)
− be used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not play major role in calculating the unit
cost)
− correspond to objective and verifiable information (i.e. their basis is clearly
defined and the beneficiary can show how they were calculated)
− only the share of the actual costs that are used for the production of the internally
invoiced good or service may be included in the pool of costs used to determine the
cost per unit; the share of these costs must be calculated by direct measurement
(‘direct costs’). The pool must not include any indirect costs (except for in HE, see
specific cases below), in particular not general administrative costs
Allocation keys resulting in a higher unit cost for the internally invoiced good or
service when used in EU grants compared with other projects will NOT be accepted.
Impact on horizontal 215-days ceiling — The share of the cost of a cost item
included in the internal invoice reduces the share of the cost item that can be charged as
direct costs to EU actions. For example, the share of the working time of a person that is
included in the calculation of the unit cost reduces the number of day-equivalents that the
person can charge over the year to EU grants (see Article 6.2.A).
Double funding risk — The same time of the person can NOT be charged twice to the
grant, i.e. it can NOT be once embedded in the unit cost and again as direct personnel
costs.
Example (costs for use of an animal housing facility):
Generally eligible as part of the unit cost:
– staff working for the facility (e.g. keepers, veterinarians and other persons directly
assigned to run the animal house)
– consumables used for the animal housing (e.g. animal food, bedding)
– depreciation of cages and other equipment directly used to the housing of the animals
– generic supplies like electricity or water used in the facility
– specific maintenance and cleaning of the animal house facility
– costs of shared infrastructures where the animal housing is located (e.g. central heating,
air-conditioning system) and their shared maintenance costs, allocated via usual key
driver
– shared services with allocation of the costs incurred for the animal house facility via usual
key driver (e.g. shared cleaning services of the building where the animal housing is
located)
– depreciation costs of shared buildings allocated via usual key driver (e.g. if the animal
housing is part of a main building of the beneficiary)
Generally ineligible as part of the unit cost:
– bank interests
– provisions for future expenses
– cost declared under other cost categories (e.g. personnel cost, equipment depreciation
cost) and indirect cost (e.g. facility management costs allocated on the basis of the
square meters the shelter occupies, general administrative costs such as those
stemming from the HR, legal or accounting departments)
– any other ineligible costs (see Article 6.3)
112EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example (costs for use of a wind tunnel facility):
Generally eligible as part of the unit cost:
– staff working for the facility (e.g. technicians, engineers and other persons directly
assigned to the functioning of the wind tunnel)
– depreciation of the equipment, including specific software and hardware necessary for the
functioning of the wind tunnel
– generic supplies like electricity used for the wind tunnel
– insurance of the wind tunnel (or the premises in which it is located)
– specific maintenance and cleaning of the wind tunnel equipment (e.g. air cooling system)
– calibration/metrology tests of the wind tunnel
– costs of shared infrastructures where the wind tunnel is located, allocated via usual key
driver (e.g. central heating, air-conditioning system) and their related shared
maintenance costs
– depreciation costs of shared buildings allocated via usual key driver (e.g. if the building
where the wind tunnel is located is part of a main building of the beneficiary)
Generally ineligible as part of the unit cost:
– bank interests
– provisions for future expenses
– cost declared under other cost categories (e.g. personnel cost, equipment depreciation
cost) and indirect cost (e.g. power supply costs allocated to a clean room on the basis of
the square meters it occupies, general administrative costs such as those stemming from
the HR, legal or accounting departments)
– any other ineligible costs (see Article 6.3)
Double funding risk — The same time of the person can NOT be charged twice to the grant,
i.e. it can NOT be once embedded in the unit cost and again as direct personnel costs.
Specific cases (costs of internally invoiced goods and services (D.2)):
Actual direct and indirect costs (HE) — If part of the usual cost accounting practices,
beneficiaries may calculate the share of the actual costs that are used for the production of
the internally invoiced good or service either by direct measurement (‘direct costs’; see
above) or by using the allocation keys defined in the costs accounting practices (‘indirect
costs’) (e.g. power supply costs allocated to a clean room on the basis of the square meters it
occupies, general administrative costs such as those stemming from the HR, legal or
accounting departments).
Co-owned resources— As an exception, if the resource for which the unit cost is calculated
is co-owned by the beneficiary and a third party, the costs registered in the accounts of the
third party for the co-owned resource do not need to be removed if:
− the third party is mentioned in the grant (e.g. as beneficiary, affiliated entity or, for
HE, third party providing in-kind contributions in Annex 1) and
− the costs fulfil the other eligibility conditions of this Article (e.g. directly linked to the
resource, exclude ineligible costs, etc).

1. HE Transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure unit costs (D.3 and
D.4): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 This cost category will be inserted for the Horizon Europe standard types of action (e.g.
RIA, CSA, COFUND, etc) that involve transnational and/or virtual access to research
infrastructure for scientific communities (‘provision of access activities’), in particular calls
under Part III of the HE Work Programme, ‘Research Infrastructures’.
This cost category is optional. Beneficiaries can declare their access costs either as unit
costs under this cost category OR simply as actual costs under another fitting cost category
(e.g. purchase cost), OR — where duly justified and subject to certain conditions — as a
combination of unit costs and actual costs.
The specific cost category in Article 6 is complemented by specific rules in Annex 5 for
carrying out the action within the meaning of Article 18 (see Annex 5 > HE access for
research infrastructure activities).
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘transnational or virtual
access to research infrastructure unit costs’.
The budget category covers direct and indirect access costs for providing transnational access
to research infrastructure (i.e. the installation’s operating costs and costs related to logistical,
technological and scientific support for users, including ad-hoc user training and the
preparatory and closing activities needed to use the installation).
114EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What not? Travel and subsistence costs for users to get transnational access are not
included in the access costs. These costs can be reimbursed separately, in category C.1
Travel and subsistence; see Article 6.2.C.1.
1.2 If declared under this budget category, the costs must be declared as unit costs, using
the unit cost table (rates per unit of access) agreed with the granting authority (see HE RI
authorising decision16 and Annex 2a and 2b).
The ‘unit of access’ must be identified for each installation (i.e. the unit used to measure the
quantity of access that the installation provides to its users).
The precise unit cost (amount per unit, i.e. EUR/unit of access) is not prefixed by the
authorising decision. It must be calculated for each access provider and installation (you can
use the calculators (calculator HE UN RI TA and calculator HE UN RI VA) provided on the call
page) and then summarised in the table ‘Summary of transnational/virtual access provision’
in the proposal and in the unit cost table in Annex 2b of the Grant Agreement:
Short name Short Installation Unit of Amount Estimated Total unit
access name access per unit No of units cost
provider infrastru No Short name (cost per unit
cture x estimated
no of units)
The summary table in the proposal is generic (must be filled in for all proposals giving access
to research infrastructure, even if they do not use the unit cost). Annex 2b is needed only for
actions that use the unit cost.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (unit of access rate) is:
− for transnational access:
{average annual total access costs to the installation (over past two years)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
average annual total quantity of access to the installation (over past two years)}
− for virtual access:
{total virtual access costs to the installation (over the last year)
_ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
total quantity of virtual access to the installation (over the last year)}
The averages must be based on:
− the beneficiary’s certified or auditable historical data
− costs allocated to the installation according to the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices (including where the installation has been in operation for less than two
years) and
16 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
115EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− a period excluding times when the installation was not usable (out of order, under repair
or undergoing long-term maintenance).
In exceptional and duly justified cases, the granting authority may agree with a beneficiary to
use a different reference period than the ones referred to above (two years for transnational
access and one year for virtual access).
The ‘total quantity of access’ means all the units of access annually provided by the installation,
included access financed under previous EU grants, if any.
The ‘annual total access costs to the installation’ is calculated on the basis of the following
categories of eligible costs:
− the direct costs incurred by the access provider for the ‘annual total quantity of access to
the installation’, as recorded in the certified or auditable profit-and-loss accounts of the
reference period for:
− personnel costs of administrative, technical and scientific staff directly assigned to
the functioning of the installation and to the support of the users
− costs of contracts for maintenance and repair (including specific cleaning, calibrating
and testing) specifically awarded for the functioning of the installation (if not
capitalised)
− costs of consumables specifically used for the installation and the user’s research
work
− costs of contracts for installation management, including security fees, insurance
costs, quality control and certification, upgrading to national and/or EU quality,
safety or security standards (if not capitalised) specifically incurred for the
functioning of the installation
− costs of energy power and water supplied for the installation where it can be verified
as being supplied exclusively for the installation and as being a major cost item for
the installation
− costs of general services when they are specifically included in the provided access
services (e.g. library costs, shipping costs, transport costs)
− costs of software licence, internet connection or other electronic services for data
management and computing when they are needed to provide access services
− costs of specific scientific services included in the access provided or needed for the
provision of access
− the indirect costs for providing access to the installation, equal to 25% of the eligible direct
costs
AND excluding:
− all contributions to the capital investments of the installation (including rental, lease
or depreciation costs of buildings as well as depreciation and lease of
instrumentation); those costs are not eligible unless otherwise specified in the work
programme/call conditions, in which case only the portion used to provide access
under the action can be eligible
− travel and subsistence costs for users
− ineligible costs as referred to in Article 6.3.
Example (amount per unit):
Assuming that a telescope provided 6 100 hours of access in year N-1 and 5 900 hours of
access in year N-2 and that the total access costs (for the provision of these total quantities of
access) in the two years calculated on the basis of the categories of costs indicated above (with
the exclusion of any contribution to capital investment and of travel and subsistence costs of
users) is respectively EUR 3 200 000 and EUR 2 800 000, then the unit cost is
Average costs = average (3 200 000, 2 800 000) = 3 000 000
Average hours = average (6 100, 5 900) = 6 000
Unit cost = average (3 200 000, 2 800 000) / average (6 100, 5 900) = 3 000 000 /6 000 =
500 €
116EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The detailed calculations used (one calculator sheet for each installation) must be kept by
beneficiaries as supporting documents in case of audits.
The granting authority may verify that the proposed unit costs comply with the prescribed
calculation method (and correct them, if needed).
The proposal and Annex 1 should describe the access services provided and the logistical,
technological and scientific support given to users (including ad-hoc training and preparatory
and closing activities necessary to use the installation).
As mentioned above, the use of unit costs for transnational and virtual access activities is
optional, i.e. each access provider can decide for each installation whether to be reimbursed
on the basis of unit costs, actual costs or a combination of the two. This decision must be
taken before grant signature and applied consistently throughout the action. In duly justified
cases, for example when there are significant variations in the costs for providing access, it
can be updated through an amendment with the agreement of the granting authority.
Double funding risk — Costs that are declared as a specific unit cost can NOT be declared a
second time under another budget category (for the costs that are covered, see below).
Example: A same cost item (e.g the salary of a member of the research infrastructure staff) cannot be used
for calculating the unit cost and then charged as actual cost under personnel costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.3 and
6.2.D.4, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1 (b))
− be incurred for providing transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure to
scientific communities.
1.4 They must be calculated, for each access provider and installation, , in accordance with
the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure unit
costs is:
{amount per unit [rate per unit of access set out in Annex 2b]}
multiplied by
{number of actual units of access provided}
The unit of access rate is fixed by the granting authority, based on the rates proposed by the
beneficiaries in Annex 2b (see above).

D.5 HE PCP/PPI procurement costs
[OPTION for HE PCP/PPI: D.5 PCP/PPI procurement costs
PCP/PPI procurement costs are eligible, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions, are calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred and:
- are incurred for a joint pre-commercial procurement or joint or coordinated public procurement of
innovative goods and services targeted by the action and described in Annex 1 and
- the procurement is carried out by a ‘contracting authority/entity’ as defined in the EU public
procurement Directives (in particular, Directives 2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU and 2009/81/EC).
The beneficiaries must award the procurement contracts to the tender(s) offering best value for money and
use objective and transparent procedures which — unless otherwise provided in the call conditions —
include:
- if a preliminary market consultation is carried out: the publication of a prior information notice about
the consultation in the Official Journal of the European Union
- the publication of a contract notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
- the publication of a contract award notice within 48 days after concluding the contract(s) in the
Official Journal of the European Union
in English and any additional language(s) chosen by the beneficiaries.
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security reasons, the beneficiaries must
ensure that the performance of the contract takes place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in
the call conditions — unless otherwise approved by the granting authority.
For PPI procurements, beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU
Directives on public procurement must also comply with these Directives and the applicable national law on
public procurement.
The beneficiaries which act as procurers (i.e. the buyers group and the lead procurer), the object and
estimated cost for each procurement and the estimated financial contribution per member of the buyers group
must be set out in Annex 1 and the estimated procurement costs per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2.
The costs for the cost categories other than procurement costs are eligible only up to 50% of the total
estimated eligible costs of the action set out in Annex 2.
This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate. ]

1. HE PCP/PPI procurement costs (D.5): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility
conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for Horizon Europe PCP/PPI actions (i.e. calls
with PCP/PPI ToA).
118EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This cost category is used ONLY for calls that run as PCP/PPI type of action (i.e. where
also the Annex 5 > HE PCP and PPI procurements provisions apply).
For these calls, the rules for subcontracts and subcontractors in Article 6.2.B and
Article 9.3 do NOT apply for the PCP or PPI procurement. Costs must be charged under
Article 6.2.D.5 (new for 2021-2027).
Other types of calls (RIA, IA, CSA, etc) are NOT subject to Article 6.2.D.5 (nor to
Annex 5) —even if projects should include PCP or PPI activities. For them, the PCP/PPI
activities must be handled as subcontracting in accordance with Article 6.2.B and Article
9.3.
However, for BOTH groups, the detailed provisions in General Annex H of the HE Work
Programme apply. If you plan to implement PCP or PPI activities in a Horizon Europe
action, you should therefore always first look at the General Annex.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘PCP/PPI procurement
costs’.
This budget category ‘covers only the costs of the PCP/PPI procurement (i.e. the price of the
PCP/PPI procurement paid to the PCP/PPI providers, including related duties, taxes and
charges, such as non-deductible, non-refundable value added tax (VAT)). Only costs of R&D
services (PCP) or innovative solutions (PPI) procured by the beneficiaries are eligible.
Be aware that different duties, taxes and charges (in particular also a different VAT rate)
may apply depending on the payment set-up for the procurement (centralised or
decentralised payments).
What not? It does not cover the costs for the additional activities related to the PCP/PPI
procurement.
‘Additional activities’ are the activities needed to prepare, manage and follow-up the PCP/PPI
procurement (including testing of solutions by the lead procurer, buyers group, or other end-
users) and further activities to embed the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side activities.
Some of those are a mandatory part of the EU action (e.g. the activities needed to coordinate
and implement the PCP/PPI procurement; see mandatory deliverables defined in General
Annex H of the HE Work Programme); others are optional (e.g. activities to embed the
PCP/PPI procurement into a wider set of demand side activities), unless otherwise specified in
the work programme/call conditions.
Examples (other additional activities): Activities that aim to remove barriers to introducing an
innovative solution on the market (including standardisation, certification and regulation); activities
that prepare the ground for cooperation on future PCP or PPI projects; awareness raising and
experience sharing/training.
Costs for additional activities must always be charged under the fitting standard cost
categories, even when they involve the procurement of (non PCP/PPI) goods or services.
Example (additional activities):
Personnel costs: Costs incurred by the lead procurer, buyers group and other consortium
participants for consulting the market, preparing the call for tender documents etc must be
charged under cost category A.
Subcontracting costs: For web design or publicity campaign to promote the PCP/PPI
procurement, for external experts that support the buyers group in evaluation of tenders must be
charged under cost category B.
Purchase costs: For travel tickets, consumables and equipment that needs to be bought by the
buyers group to test innovative solutions of the providers that win the PCP/PPI contracts must be
charged under cost category C.
119EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Financial support to third parties (FSTP): To award a prize to the solution provider(s) that
performed best in the PCP/PPI procurement must be charged under cost category D.
In-kind contributions (free of charge): Potential end-users of the solutions (e.g. fire brigade)
may make available personnel/equipment to the buyers group (e.g. Ministry of interior) to help test
innovative solutions. For HE PCP/PPI actions, the costs of the personnel/equipment may be
declared as eligible costs by the beneficiaries which use them under the standard cost categories A
and C.2, as if they were their own (see Article 6.1).
Indirect costs for the PCP/PPI procurement costs are also NOT reimbursed.
1.2 PCP/PPI procurement costs must be declared as actual costs (i.e. the price actually
paid).
1.3 The ‘PCP/PPI procurement costs’ must fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article
6.2.D.5, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a))
− be incurred for the PCP/PPI procurement described in Annex 1
− be based on the best value for money
− not be subject to conflict of interest
− awarded following objective and transparent procedures that comply with certain
minimum conditions and
− for PPI: for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’
within the meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24/EU,
2014/25/EU and 2009/81/EC): comply with these Directives and the applicable
national law on public procurement
For PCP/PPI procurements, the contracts may NOT be awarded based on the lowest
price as the only award criterion. In addition to the price, it is mandatory to take into
account also the quality of the proposed innovative solutions in the evaluation of the
tenders.
The minimum procedural conditions explicitly mentioned in Article 6 include obligations to
publish in the OJEU (TED portal) — at least in English (and in any additional languages
chosen by the beneficiaries) — prior information notices (PIN) to announce the open market
consultation and the upcoming PCP/PPI procurement, as well as contract notices and contract
award notices for the PCP/PPI call for tenders.
Regarding deadlines for publication of notices, we will consider as the ‘date of publication’
the date when you submitted the notice to the OJEU Publication Office.
Additional transparency requirements (including timing and exceptions) are set out in Annex
5 > PCP and PPI procurements and General Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
For general guidance on PCP/PPI types of action in HE, see How to set up and manage HE PCP
and PPI grants, HE Programme Guide > Innovation Procurement and General Annexes B and H of
the HE Work Programme.
120EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For PCP procurements, the EU Public Procurement Directives normally do not apply (because
exempted17). However, national laws on public procurement may apply if they have rules for
this type of R&D service contracts. For PPI procurements, both the EU Directives and the
national laws apply.
The beneficiaries which act as procurers (i.e. the buyers group and the lead procurer), the
object and estimated cost for each procurement and the estimated financial contribution per
member of the buyers group must be justified in Annex 1. There is NO simplified approval
procedure).
Finally, there is a cost eligibility ceiling: PCP/PPI procurement costs must amount to a
minimum of 50% of the total estimated costs of the action in the budget table, and all
additional costs can amount to maximum 50% of the costs. This is due to the fact that the
PCP/PPI procurement should be the main objective of PCP/PPI actions.
The maximum amount for additional activities is fixed at Grant Agreement signature, based
on all the estimated eligible costs of the action. The maximum amount of EU funding for
additional activities therefore does NOT change (i.e. will NOT be reduced by the granting
authority) when at the end of the action it turns out that the costs actually incurred for
PCP/PPI procurement are less than initially estimated (e.g. if the buyers group is able to
procure at a better price than it had initially budgeted).
1.4 Regarding the calculation, the amount charged as eligible cost must correspond to the
price invoiced for the PCP/PPI procurement(s).

− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred/units used during the
action duration, necessary for the action, identifiable and verifiable, etc; see Article
6.1(a) and (b))
− fulfil the eligibility conditions for the underlying types of costs in question (i.e.
subcontracting, financial support to third parties (FSTP) and internally invoiced goods
and services)
− be incurred for activities eligible for additional funding and for the objectives for which
it was awarded.
2.4. Regarding the calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible (unit or actual)
costs incurred and must be calculated according to the rules applicable to the type of cost in
question.
Specific cases (ERC additional costs (D.7 and D.8)):
Simplified approval procedure (ERC additional costs) — If you need to make some
changes in relation to the additional funding granted, the coordinator must request an
amendment in order to change the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure; for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the
beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting authority might not approve the change
and reject the costs at interim or final payment-stage later on. It is highly recommended to
contact the granting authority before deciding on any change.
Examples (change that could be accepted):
1. The additional funding was awarded to purchase a particular piece of major equipment. During
the implementation of the action, the PI proposes to use the additional funding to acquire a newly
developed equipment that would allow the research team to carry out the action tasks in a more
efficient manner. This change could be accepted.
2. The additional funding was awarded to carry out a sociological experiment in three European
countries. During the implementation of the action, the PI proposes to enlarge the scope of the
funded research and to include a fourth non-European country in the abovementioned
experiment. This change could be accepted.
Examples (change that would not be accepted):
123EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. The additional funding was awarded to finance a scientific expedition to Antarctica. After
successfully executing the expedition, the PI proposes to use remaining additional funding to
purchase equipment for the action. This change would not be accepted.
2. The additional funding was awarded to cover the internally invoiced access to large facilities of
the beneficiary. During the implementation of the action, the PI proposes to use the additional
funding to recruit new team members in order to explore and develop alternative lines of
research. This change would not be accepted.

The entity’s statutes must include a provision that, in case of dissolution,
the land will be transferred to another legal body primarily active in the field
of nature conservation (e.g. another conservation NGO or appropriate public
body).
− for purchases of partial rights: the entry into the land register must duly reflect
the long term nature conservation objectives and the requirements set out in
Article 6.2.D.2 of the Grant Agreement
− for land purchased to be exchanged at a later date for another parcel on which
the action will be undertaken: the exchange must be carried out before the end
of the action and the land exchanged must comply with the requirements set
out in Article 6.2.D.2 of the Grant Agreement.
For long-term leases:
− the lease must be of at least 20 years (unless provided otherwise in the call
conditions)
− the lease must include provisions and commitments that ensure the
achievement of its objectives in terms of habitat and species protection.
Land purchases must be done by one of the project participants who is either a well-
established private organisation (e.g. nature conservation NGO or other) or a public body
with nature conservation responsibility, and must remain in its ownership after the end of the
project.
The purchased land must be the subject, during the action, of specific restoration and/or
active management or restrictions of use that go beyond existing legal obligations or existing
restrictions that could be imposed without purchasing the land. The purchase of land that is
already in excellent conservation status (i.e. that requires no restoration or specific
management or restrictions of use) is eligible only very exceptionally, if indispensable for the
objectives of the project.
Evidence must be provided that the land (to be) purchased was not owned by a public
authority in the 24 months before the project application was submitted to the EU.
Compliance with all applicable conditions must be specifically demonstrated in the proposal.
In particular, proposals are expected to include:
131EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− evidence that the purchase price is consistent with the market price for the type of
land and the region concerned (e.g. letter from competent authority, registered
notary, real estate agent, etc)
− In case of land purchase, long term lease and one-off compensations, the
beneficiaries need to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness already at proposal stage.
During the project (and at the latest with the final report), we will require a copy of the sales
contract and/or entry in the land register, including the guarantee related to the long-term
conservation. For countries that do not allow to include such guarantee in land registers and
sales contract, you will be required to provide an equivalent guarantee, with the same legal
level of protection in the long term.

1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes; except CEF, CCEI and
some LIFE and EUAF calls), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge the ‘Indirect
costs’.
This budget category covers all costs for the action that are not directly linked to it (i.e.
overheads).
1.2 Indirect costs are declared as a fixed flat-rate (except EDF). For most programmes the
flat-rate is fixed at 7% of the eligible direct costs in accordance with Article 184(6) EU
Financial Regulation 2024/250920; for some programmes, a higher rate is foreseen in the
Programme Regulation (basic act; see specific cases below)).
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.E, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for flat-rate costs to be eligible (i.e. costs to which the flat-
rate is applied must be eligible, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1(c))
1.4 The costs must be calculated by applying the 7% flat-rate to the eligible costs
(categories A-D, except volunteers costs and exempted specific cost categories, if any).
The calculation itself is automated: The indirect cost amount is prefilled by the IT system.
Beneficiaries can change the amount, if they would like to request less indirect costs (for
instance, because they have a parallel EU operating grant and are not able to demonstrate
cost separation; see specific cases below).
Specific cases (indirect costs (E.))
25% indirect cost flat-rate (HE, SME COSME EEN, EDF) — If this option is activated in the

− EUR 100 000 personnel costs
− EUR 20 000 subcontracting costs
− EUR 10 000 other goods and services (consumables).
Eligible direct costs: 100 000 + 20 000 + 10 000 = EUR 130 000
Eligible indirect costs: 25 % of (100 000 + 10 000) = EUR 27 500
Total eligible costs: EUR 157 500
Other indirect cost flat-rates (RFCS, AGRIP, SMP ESS) — If other options are activated in
the Grant Agreement, the system will automatically calculate the indirect costs using those
flat-rates (e.g. RFCS 35%, AGRIP 4%, SMP ESS 30% all on category A. Personnel costs,
except volunteers costs).
Actual indirect costs (EDF) — If provided for in the call conditions, the beneficiaries may
charge actual indirect cost in accordance with the rules of the Grant Agreement (instead of a
flat-rate). Only beneficiaries whose usual cost accounting practices to calculate indirect costs
are accepted by national authorities for comparable activities in the defence domain can use
this option. This means that if your national authorities do not accept actual indirect costs for
national contracts (e.g. they accept only a simplification option like flat-rates) or you have
not carried out comparable activities in the defence domain under national contracts, you
cannot use this option. Different beneficiaries within the same action may choose different
options for their indirect costs.
Combining of EU action and operating grants — Beneficiaries that have parallel EU
action grants and operating grants may claim indirect costs in their action grants ONLY if they
are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that their operating grants do not cover any
costs which are covered by their action grants).
‘Operating grants’ are not always easy to identify. They exist under various labels (operating
grants; financial contributions/support to the functioning/operation of entities; etc). Check
your call conditions.
Example: Operating grants are grants awarded to support the running costs of certain institutions
pursuing an aim of European interest, such as: College of Europe, European standards bodies
(CEN, CENELEC, ETSI).
To demonstrate cost separation, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
− the operating grant may NOT cover 100% of the beneficiary’s annual budget (i.e. it
may not be a full operating grant)
− the beneficiary must use analytical accounting which allows for a cost accounting
management with cost allocation keys and cost accounting codes AND must apply
these keys and codes to identify and separate the costs (i.e. to allocate them to either
the action grant activities or the operating grant activities)
− the beneficiary must record:
− all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by their operating
grants (i.e. personnel, general running costs and other operating costs linked
to the operating grant work programme of activities) and
− all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by the action grant
(including the real indirect costs linked to the action)
137EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the allocation of the costs must be done in a way that leads to a fair, objective and
realistic result.
Beneficiaries that cannot fulfil these conditions must either:
− keep the operating grant, but sign the action grant without indirect costs or request
no indirect costs at reporting stage (i.e. lower the pre-filled amount in the indirect cost
column of the financial statement)
or
− renounce to the operating grant, in order to be able to claim the indirect costs in the
action grant.
Best practice: In case of overlapping EU action and operating grants, contact the granting
authority for advice.

1. Contributions (F.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (currently not in any programme), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Contributions’.
Contributions are simplified forms of output based funding. They are normally based on an
approximation of the costs, calculated ex-ante, and paid on the basis of pre-defined mile
stones/work packages. However, contrary to simplified costs (e.g. unit cost), they do not
work with funding rates (because the contribution already incorporates the funding rate in
the ex-ante calculation of the amount). This means that there is no need to apply any
funding rate to the amount claimed by the recipient in a request for payment.
139EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Currently no EU programme uses simplified contributions inside their actual cost grants (i.e.
all budget categories are calculated with a funding rate).
By contrast, full lump sum or unit grants (e.g. in HE, DEP, CEF, INNOVFUND, JTM, etc) are
usually contribution-based (meaning no funding rate needed in the budget table in Annex 2).

31 For the definition, see Article 183(2)(b) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: ‘operating grant’ means an EU grant to finance “the
functioning of a body which has an objective forming part of and supporting an EU policy”.
32 Condition must be specified in the call.
1.Types of ineligible costs and contributions
What? Costs and contributions are ineligible, if one of the following applies:
− they do not meet the general and specific eligibility conditions set out in Articles 6.1
and 6.2
Examples: Bonuses paid by participants that do not fulfil the conditions set out in Article 6.2;
subcontracting costs that do not comply with Article 6.2.
− they are listed in Article 6.3, in particular:
− costs related to return on capital or dividends paid by a beneficiary
Example: Dividends paid as remuneration for investing in the action; remuneration paid
as a share in the company’s equity.
− debt and debt service charges
‘Debt service’ is the amount paid on a loan in principal and interest, over a
period of time.
Example: A beneficiary takes a loan used to acquire equipment or consumables for the
project of EUR 100 000 at 9 percent interest for 10 years, the debt service for the first
year (principal and interest) is EUR 15 582 and cannot be declared as eligible cost.
− provisions for future losses or debts
‘Provision’ means an amount set aside in an organisation’s accounts, to cover for
a known liability of uncertain timing or amount. This includes allowances for
doubtful or bad debts.
− interest owed (e.g. negative interest charged to the beneficiary’s bank account )
− currency exchange losses (i.e. for beneficiaries using currencies other than euros
or being invoiced in a currency other than the currency they use: any loss due to
exchange rate fluctuations, e.g. between the date of invoicing and the date of
payment)
− bank costs charged by the beneficiary’s bank for transfers from the granting
authority
Conversely, bank charges for the distribution of the EU funding from the
coordinator to the beneficiaries may constitute an eligible cost for the
coordinator (if the eligibility conditions of Article 6.1 and Article 6.2.C.3 are
met).
− excessive or reckless expenditure
142EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Excessive’ means paying significantly more for products, services or personnel
than the prevailing market rates or the usual practices of the beneficiary (and
thus resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action).
‘Reckless’ means failing to exercise care in the selection of products, services or
personnel (and thus resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action).
− ineligible VAT (deductible or refundable VAT, including VAT paid by public bodies
acting as public authority)
The detailed provisions regarding the eligibility of VAT under the Financial
Regulation 2024/2509 are as follows:
VAT is eligible where it is not recoverable under the applicable national VAT
legislation AND is paid by a beneficiary other than a non-taxable person within
the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 13(1) of Directive 2006/11221
(see Article 189(4)(c) FR22).
VAT is considered ‘not recoverable’ within the meaning of Article 189(4) FR if it
is not deductible or refundable under the applicable national VAT legislation.
This is, in particular, the case if according to national law it is attributable to any
of the following activities:
− (i) exempt activities without right of deduction
− (ii) activities which fall outside the scope of VAT
− (iii) activities, as referred to in point (i) or (ii), in respect of which
VAT is not deductible but refunded by means of specific refund
schemes or compensation funds not referred to in Directive
2006/112, even if that scheme or fund is established by national VAT
legislation.
‘Non-taxable persons’ are inter alia public bodies (i.e. states, regional and local
government authorities and other bodies governed by public law) in respect of
activities or transactions in which they engage as public authorities (see Article
13(1) Directive 2006/112). However, Article 189(4) FR clarifies that, for the
purposes of eligibility of costs for EU funding, VAT relating to the activities listed
in Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112 must be regarded as paid by a ‘beneficiary
other than a non-taxable person’, regardless of whether those activities are
regarded by the Member State concerned as activities engaged in by bodies
governed by public law acting as public authorities. Thus, ‘VAT paid by public
bodies acting as public authority’ (meaning any VAT, whether
deductible/refundable or not) is ineligible for public bodies acting as public
authority. However, this does not include VAT relating to the activities listed in
Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112 which can be eligible provided they are not
deductible or refundable.
The general idea is therefore that in principle only VAT that is a genuine and
definitive cost should normally be charged to the EU actions (— however subject
to the boundaries and exceptions set out above).

11.12.2006, p. 1).
22 [old Financial Regulation: Article 186(4)(c) FR 2018/1046].
143EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best practice: Ideally, VAT amounts (both if eligible and not) should be clearly
identifiable in the accounting records.
Thus, the cost and revenue accounts should exclude deductible and refundable
VAT; such VAT should be recorded in separate payable or receivable accounts,
without effect on revenue or cost line items.
VAT paid is a claim against the tax authority. It should be recorded in the
‘assets’ part of the balance sheet. It should not be recorded as expenditure in
the profit and loss accounts (only the purchase price of goods and services
excluding VAT should be recorded). Similarly, for the value of purchased
equipment or assets, only the net purchase cost should be recorded in the
balance sheet’s fixed asset line, and the depreciation cost should be calculated
based on this value, excluding VAT.
VAT collected is a debt towards the tax authority and should therefore be
recorded in the ‘liabilities’ part of the balance sheet.
If applicable (most programmes; except CEF, EUAF, CCEI, UCPM), VAT that
does NOT fall under the above kinds of ineligible VAT can be eligible and
charged under the category of cost to which it relates.
− costs incurred during the suspension of the implementation of the action
Example: Action is suspended and one of the beneficiaries continues working on it after
the date of the suspension
− in-kind contributions for free (these are not a cost for the beneficiary; except in
HE where they can be charged as eligible costs; see Article 6.1)
− costs declared under another EU grant (i.e. double funding), except for
‘Synergies actions’ or operating grants
This includes:
− costs funded directly by other EU programmes managed by the European
Commission or EU executive agencies
− costs managed/funded/awarded by Member States but co-funded from
the EU budget (e.g. Structural Funds, RRF, etc)
− costs for grants awarded/funded/managed by other EU, international or
national bodies and co-funded with EU funds (e.g. joint undertakings,
Article 185 TFEU bodies)
− costs or contributions for staff of a national (or regional/local) administration, for
activities that are part of the administration’s normal activities (i.e. not
undertaken only because of the grant) cannot be charged to the project.
However, if additional otherwise normal activities are implemented directly and
specifically for the project, such cost can be declared, even if they are the same
kind of activities as the administration’s normal tasks. These must be activities
that are implemented due to the action and either additional in quality (different
in nature or conditions) or quantity (more than usual), to the normal operations
of the national (or regional/local) administration.
Example: Giving a fine for speed excess may be considered as a normal activity of
the police, but if this is done in a specific place for a specific time due to the
implementation of a LIFE project testing new speed limits to improve air quality, they
are different in quality and/or quantity to what the police would have done otherwise
and therefore directly and specifically implemented for the action.
144EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− costs or contributions (especially travel and subsistence) for staff or
representatives of EU institutions, bodies or agencies
− for restricted calls due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security
reasons (HE, DEP, EDF and CEF-DIG): costs or contributions for activities that do
not take place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions — unless approved by the granting authority
− cost declared specifically ineligible in the call conditions.
2. Declaration of ineligible costs or contributions
If a participant declares ineligible costs or contributions in a financial statement, they will be
rejected by the granting authority (see Article 27).
Specific cases (ineligible costs):
Partially deductible VAT — Some entities have a mixed VAT regime, meaning that they
carry out VAT exempt or out-of-the-scope activities AND VAT taxed activities. When VAT paid
on goods or services by these entities cannot be directly allocated to one or the other
category of activities, it will be partially deductible. Therefore it will also be partially eligible.
The eligible part corresponds to the pro-rata of the VAT which is not deductible for that
entity.
In these cases, the beneficiary uses a provisional (estimated) deduction ratio during the year.
The final ratio is only determined at the end of the financial year. The beneficiary must
regularise VAT when closing its accounts. Therefore, the beneficiary must also regularize the
VAT costs declared for the grant (by declaring, in the next reporting period, an adjustment
for the difference between the provisional deduction ratio and the final ratio).
VAT incurred in non-EU countries — VAT which cannot be refunded in third countries may
be considered eligible under certain conditions. The beneficiaries must be able to show that
their request for exemption has been rejected by the competent authorities or the applicable
legislation which stipulate that VAT cannot be refunded.
If a beneficiary receives a VAT refund after the receipt of the final payment, it needs to
inform the granting authority which may recover amounts unduly paid.
Non-identifiable VAT in foreign invoices — In exceptional cases where the beneficiary
cannot identify the VAT charged by the supplier (e.g. small non-EU invoices), the full
purchase price can be recorded in the accounts if it is not possible to deduct/refund the VAT.
That VAT would therefore be eligible.
Duties — The eligibility of duties depends on the eligibility of the cost item to which they are
linked (i.e. in whose price they are included). If the item is eligible, the duty is also eligible.
Combining EU Synergy actions — Different EU grants can be combined if the combined
actual funding rate over all eligible costs of the project does not go above 100% AND the
grant is flagged as ‘Synergy action’ (see Data Sheet, Point 1). If the synergy is not already
coordinated by the granting authorities from the outset (as a ‘Synergy call’, i.e. coordinated
call by both granting authorities with combined fixed funding rates that do not go above
100%; see also Article 3), the beneficiaries need to inform the granting authorities if they
apply for and receive more than one source of EU funding for the action. To prevent double
funding and subsequent cost rejections and recoveries, the granting authorities will assess
adaptations of the action(s) on a case-by-case basis (this may include partitioning of the
action, rejection/reduction of eligible cost, etc).
Best practice: If you notice that your grant is not flagged as ‘Synergy action’ although it
should be, contact the granting authority to see if it is possible to make an amendment.
145EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Combining EU actions with the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) actions —
Except in very exceptional circumstances (see below) EU grants can NOT be combined with
RRF actions because the funding model of the RRF (which finances milestones and targets
without direct connection to individual project costs) makes it normally not possible to
combine RRF funding with other EU funding for the same set of activities (and costs). If the
same project should nonetheless receive funding from an EU programme and the RRF, the
project must be designed as separate actions, clearly delineated and separated for each part
(without overlaps of activities (and costs)).
In exceptional cases where it is established that an ex-ante cost delineation is not feasible or
excessively burdensome, the granting authority may agree to allow combining support from
the RRF and other directly managed programmes on a pro-rata basis (i.e. combined support
for the same project) as a last resort under certain strict conditions.23 One of these conditions
is that the combined support (i.e. grant from the directly managed programme + RRF Grant)
does not exceed the eligible costs under the directly managed programme.
This implies that the EU granting authority will need to check and verify at the level of the
beneficiary how much RRF funding the project received and lower the amount of the EU grant
(by either lowering the requested grant amount or rejecting costs) where the combined RRF
support and directly managed EU grant exceed 100% of the eligible costs under the EU
managed grant. Where the support from the directly managed programme takes the form of
a lump sum, the eligible costs will be assumed to be those that were accepted during grant
preparation and which were used as the basis for defining the lump sum amount in the EU
grant agreement.
Combining of EU action and operating grants — EU action grants can be combined with
EU operating grants if the beneficiaries are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that the
operating grant does not cover any costs which are already covered by the action grants, in
particular indirect costs already covered by the action grant). If cost separation cannot be
demonstrated, beneficiaries can still keep both grants, but must renounce to the flat-rate on
indirect cost in the action grant (since the indirect cost are already considered to be covered
by the operating grant). For detailed conditions, see Article 6.2.E.
Example: Operating grants are grants awarded to support the running costs of certain institutions
pursuing an aim of European interest, such as: College of Europe, European standards bodies
(CEN, CENELEC, ETSI).

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES
AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS
General > Article 7 — Beneficiaries
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting authority for
implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance with all the
obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action under their own
responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated entities or other participants (see
Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the beneficiaries fails to
implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure that this part is implemented by
someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the maximum grant amount and subject to an
amendment; see Article 39). The financial responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed
by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding the grant for the
entire duration of the action. Costs and contributions will be eligible only as long as the beneficiary and the
action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any events or
circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the implementation of the action (see
Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the pre-financing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if
required; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article 21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority under the
Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their affiliated
entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and the granting
authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies otherwise, and in
particular:
147EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- submit the pre-financing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify their quality
and completeness before passing them on to the granting authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other beneficiaries
(report on the distribution of payments; if required, see Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other beneficiaries
without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary or third
party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii) last indent and
(iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have created or which are controlled by or
affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance
with the obligations under the Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’33 (or similar, such as European research infrastructure
consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to one of their members. The
coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-ordination, to ensure that
the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written
consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of recoveries (if
any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article 16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION for programmes with linked actions: [OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked actions, the
beneficiaries must have arrangements with the participants of the other action, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written
collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the consortium is the same, as part of
their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
33 For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy the criteria for being awarded a
grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the
purpose of implementing the action financed by the grant.”
148EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of outputs,
common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy activities, common
communication and dissemination activities, sharing of information, access to background and
results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in both actions.
The arrangements with the participants of the other action must not contain any provision contrary to this
Agreement.] ]
1. Division of roles and responsibilities — Responsibilities towards the granting
authority — Technical and financial responsibility for the action
The beneficiaries are formal parties to the Grant Agreement (they sign the Grant Agreement
or Accession Forms). They have direct contractual obligations under the Grant Agreement
and are fully responsible for implementing the action properly (see Article 11).
This means that:
− each beneficiary must ensure that it complies with its obligations under the Grant
Agreement
− each beneficiary must ensure swift and proper implementation of the action (i.e. that
there are no delays and that the work is done properly)
− each beneficiary is responsible (towards the granting authority) for the tasks
performed by its subcontractors, affiliated entities and associated partners
− the granting authority is NOT responsible for the implementation of the action and has
NO responsibility for the way in which the action is conducted (or any adverse
consequences).
The beneficiaries are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. This
means that they (and any new beneficiaries added later on during the project through an
amendment) accept that they are together responsible for fully implementing the whole
project.
If one of the beneficiaries leaves the action (irrespective of the reason), the remaining
partners must carry out the action as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1)
— including the part of the defaulting beneficiary. They will have to do this without any
additional funding. The Grant Agreement will have to be amended, in order to redistribute the
tasks, terminate the beneficiary’s participation, and/or add a new beneficiary (see Article 39).
Example: Beneficiaries A, B and C have signed a Grant Agreement with a duration of three years
with the Commission in order to carry out an action. One year later, beneficiary C goes bankrupt.
Beneficiaries A and B remain fully responsible to implement the whole action, including the tasks
of C. A and B must agree that one (or both) take over the part of beneficiary C (or ensure
replacement by adding a new beneficiary), to make sure that the entire action is implemented as
described in Annex 1.
From a financial point of view, each participant is in principle responsible for the proper and
sound financial management of their part of the grant. In case of recoveries, there may
however, depending on the programme and Grant Agreement, be certain situations where
beneficiaries may be held responsible for their partners (financial liability):
149EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): the financial liability is as
follows:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation, but not intervene to recover this money (no debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole
amount that needs to be recovered (i.e. paid back to the granting authority)—
even if it has not been the final recipient of the concerned amount (debit note);
if the coordinator does not pay (irrespective of the reason), the granting
authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, drawing on the pre-
financing guarantee, joint and several liability of other beneficiaries or affiliated
entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see Article 22.4)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): each beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle
limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by their affiliated
entities. It is only for the contribution to the MIM that financial responsibility is
shared:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation and, if the beneficiary doesn’t pay, the granting authority may call
on the MIM to intervene and then start a recovery procedure against the
beneficiary for the account of the MIM (debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the contribution to the MIM will be used to
cover recoveries (if any); if the contribution is not sufficient, the coordinator
will be asked to pay back the amount owed (as representative of the
consortium); if the debt is not paid but the report on the distribution of
payments was provided, the granting authority will calculate the share of the
debt per beneficiary and confirm the amount to be recovered from each of
them separately (debit note); if they do not pay (irrespective of the reason),
the granting authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, joint and
several liability of affiliated entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see
Article 22.4); if the report on the distribution of payments was NOT provided,
the granting authority will enforce recovery against the coordinator (debit
note); if needed, the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and
will then continue recovery for the account of the MIM (second debit note
replacing the first)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note); no MIM intervention (new for 2021-
2027).
Beneficiaries are always liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities (see Article
22.2).
2. Division of roles and responsibilities — Roles and responsibilities within the
consortium
The general division of roles and responsibilities within the consortium is as follows:
− the coordinator must coordinate and manage the grant and is the central contact point
for the granting authority
150EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the beneficiaries and other participants must all together contribute to a smooth and
successful implementation of the grant (i.e. contribute to the proper implementation
of the action, comply with their own obligations under the Grant Agreement and
support the coordinator in his obligations).
All communication with the granting authority should in principle go through the coordinator.
Documents/information should be submitted via the coordinator — unless, for specific cases,
the granting authority requests individual partners to provide such information directly (e.g.
in case of an audit, the beneficiaries must submit the documents requested directly to the
auditors, see Article 25).
Other participants (i.e. affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors, etc) may be
part of the consortium, if this is considered useful by the beneficiaries. It is generally
recommended to involve all entities that are important for the successful implementation of
the project, independently of their formal role in the grant.
3. The coordinator’s roles and responsibilities
The coordinator is the central contact point for the granting authority and represents the
consortium (towards the granting authority).
For this purpose, the Grant Agreement imposes a number of specific coordination tasks.
Coordination tasks:
▪ Monitor that the action is implemented properly
▪ Act as the intermediary for all communications — unless the Grant Agreement
specifies otherwise
▪ Request and review documents or information required by the granting authority
and verify their completeness and correctness
▪ Submit the deliverables and reports in the system
▪ Submit the pre-financing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
▪ Distribute payments to the other beneficiaries, without unjustified delay
▪ Inform the granting authority of the amounts paid to each beneficiary, if requested
to do so (see Articles 22 and 32)
The coordination tasks include quality-checking of documents/information submitted by the
beneficiaries, in particular:
− reviewing the individual financial statements from each beneficiary to verify
consistency with the action tasks, as well as completeness and correctness
− verifying that all the requested documents/information have been provided by the
beneficiary (e.g. the use of resources, etc)
− verifying that the beneficiary submits the documents/information in the requested
format
− verifying that the technical information submitted by a beneficiary concerns its action
tasks as described in Annex 1 (and not something unrelated to the action).
The coordinator is not, however, obliged to verify the eligibility of the costs declared, nor to
request justifications. Each beneficiary/affiliated entity remains responsible for the cost it
declares (both as regards eligibility and as regards sufficient records and supporting
documents to substantiate them).
151EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The coordination tasks listed above can NOT be subcontracted or outsourced to another
entity including other beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, or associated partners.
They can only be delegated, under certain circumstances, to entities with ‘authorisation to
administer’ or in the case of ‘sole beneficiaries’ within the meaning of Article 190(2) of the
Financial Regulation 2024/250924 (see below).
By contrast, the coordinator remains free — like any other beneficiary — to use affiliated
entities or subcontractors for other tasks; see Articles 8 and 9.3).
Specific cases (coordinator responsibilities):
‘Entities with authorisation to administer’ — Coordinators that are public bodies may
exceptionally delegate coordination tasks (e.g. the administration of the payments) to
another entity, if this is their usual practice (e.g. a foundation).
For the handling of such coordinator tasks, this other entity must fulfil the following
conditions:
− it must participate as an affiliated entity of the coordinator
and
− it must have been granted an ‘authorisation to administer’ in order to handle the
coordinator’s administrative affairs (and those must include receiving and
administering EU funds).
In this case, the bank account number to be provided by the coordinator during grant
preparation must be that of the entity with the authorisation to administer. The payments will
then be transferred directly to it and it will have to distribute them for the coordinator.
Since they participate as affiliated entity, the entity must be registered in the Participant
Register (have a PIC) and be validated by the Central Validation Service.
The coordinator will remain fully responsible for the entity under the Grant Agreement. For
detailed guidance, see the specific cases in Article 8.
‘Sole beneficiaries’ (or similar, e.g. ERICs25) — Entities which form one joint entity for the
purpose of implementing the action and all comply with the eligibility criteria can participate
as ‘sole beneficiaries’ in EU actions (see Article 190(2) FR 2024/250926). Coordinators which
are sole beneficiaries (or similar, e.g. European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERICs))
and do not have their own resources may exceptionally delegate the coordination tasks to
one of their members. Coordinators using one of their members remain fully responsible for
them under the Grant Agreement.
Technical/scientific coordination (or similar) — The coordinator within the meaning of
the Grant Agreement is the beneficiary in charge of the (administrative) coordination tasks
set out in this Article. Other kinds of coordination activities, i.e. tasks not listed in this Article
(e.g. of technical or scientific nature) can be carried out by any other participant.
These participants may internally (i.e. within the consortium) be called, for example,
‘technical’ or ‘scientific coordinator’, but they will NOT be considered coordinator in the
meaning of the Grant Agreement and are not subject to the rules in Article 7.
24 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(2) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
25 Council Regulation (EC) No 723/2009 of 25 June 2009 on the Community legal framework for a European
Research Infrastructure Consortium (OJ L 206, 08.08.2009, p.1).
26 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(2) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
152EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs for this type of technical/scientific coordination are eligible, if they comply with the
eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.
4. Internal arrangements between beneficiaries — Consortium agreement
The participants should (mandatory for multi-beneficiary grants, if required in the Data
Sheet) conclude a consortium agreement to ensure a smooth and successful action
implementation.
The ‘consortium agreement’ is an agreement between members of the consortium, to set out
their internal arrangements for implementing the project and the administration of the EU
grant. It is purely internal; it should NOT be submitted to the granting authority for
information or review; the granting authority is NOT party and has NO responsibility for it
(nor for any adverse consequences).
Best practice: In view of their importance for avoiding disputes and ensuring a smooth
implementation of the grant, we strongly recommend that every consortium sets up a
consortium agreement, even if not mandatory in the Data Sheet. In any case, the
beneficiaries need to put in place all necessary arrangements regarding their operation and
co-ordination to ensure the proper implementation of the action.
The consortium agreement should complement the Grant Agreement and must NOT contain
any provision contrary to it (or the applicable EU, international or national law).
It should in principle be negotiated and concluded before grant signature (i.e. each
beneficiary should sign the consortium agreement before signing the Accession Form to
accede to the Grant Agreement). Otherwise, there is usually a serious risk that prolonged
disagreement jeopardises the action. Of course, the consortium agreement does not have to
remain the same during the lifetime of the action, it can be modified by the consortium at
any moment.
The duration should at least cover the time until the final payment, however, a longer or
open-ended duration, where relevant, should be considered in order to fully cover any issues
that may emerge after the final payment, such as exploitation of the results (e.g. licensing),
issues arising from audits, etc.
The agreement must be in writing. It may be a simple written agreement or take some other
form (e.g. a notarial deed or part of the statutes of a separate legal entity, such as a
European Economic Interest Grouping, association or joint venture).
For guidance on consortium agreements, see How to draw up your consortium agreement. This
document has been developed for H2020 actions (MFF 2014-2020), but it can also serve for
inspiration in other EU programmes and for the new MFF 2021-2027. In case of questions, please
contact the granting authority.
5. Relationship with beneficiaries of linked actions — Collaboration agreement
The participants of linked actions must make arrangements to determine and coordinate
implementation in the areas where close collaboration is needed and should conclude a
collaboration agreement (mandatory if required in the Data Sheet), to ensure that linked
actions are implemented and coordinated properly.
‘Collaboration agreement’ are agreements between the participants of linked actions to
coordinate their work. The granting authority is not party and has NO responsibility for them
(nor for any adverse consequences). If the consortium in the linked actions is the same, the
collaboration agreement may be included as part of the consortium agreement.
The collaboration agreement should complement the Grant Agreement and must NOT contain
any provision contrary to it (or the applicable EU, international or national law).
153EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
It should set out the details on the collaboration and synchronisation of the activities as well
as on the internal organisation and decision processes of the linked actions. If considered
useful, it can also foresee common boards and advisory structures. These will complement
the governance of each of the linked actions; they can NOT replace the consortium and other
project governance mechanisms that are required for the EU action (if applicable).
For guidance on collaboration agreements, see How to draw up your collaboration agreement.
This document has been developed for H2020 actions (MFF 2014-2020), but it can also serve for
inspiration in other EU programmes and for the new MFF 2021-2027. In case of questions, please
contact the granting authority.

General > Article 8 — Affiliated entities
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
[OPTION 1 for programmes without affiliated entities: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with affiliated entities (standard): [OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The
following entities which are linked to a beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘affiliated entities’:
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short name)]
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short name)]
[same for more AE]
Affiliated entities can charge costs and contributions to the action under the same conditions as the
beneficiaries and must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in accordance with Article
11.
Their costs and contributions will be included in Annex 2 and will be taken into account for the calculation of
the grant.
The beneficiaries must ensure that all their obligations under this Agreement also apply to their affiliated
entities.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the affiliated entities.
Breaches by affiliated entities will be handled in the same manner as breaches by beneficiaries. Recovery of
undue amounts will be handled through the beneficiaries.
If the granting authority requires joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4),
they must sign the declaration set out in Annex 3a and may be held liable in case of enforced recoveries
against their beneficiaries (see Article 22.2 and 22.4).]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable] ]
1. Affiliated entities
Affiliated entities (in some programmes formerly called ‘linked third parties’; new for 2021-
2027) are entities with a (usually legal or capital) link to a beneficiary and which implement
parts of the action and are allowed to charge costs directly to the grant.
They do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA) but can be part of
the consortium and often play an important role in implementing the action. Therefore, the
Grant Agreement mentions them by name and defines their role (rights and obligations).
In practice, they are treated in many ways like beneficiaries (have their own financial
statement, must provide their own CFS, must contribute to the technical report, must submit
deliverables, etc).
Annotations in this AGA which refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to
affiliated entities (just like the provisions of the MGA themselves; see also MGA
Preamble).
For technical and security reasons, affiliated entities do NOT however have direct
access to the Portal My Area section (see Article 36). They therefore always need to go
through their beneficiaries (to sign the declaration of honour, submit financial statements,
contribute to the technical report, etc).
155EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Characteristics of implementation by affiliated entities:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1 (including the
handling of subcontracting, financial support to third parties (FSTP), etc).
▪ They do not charge a ‘price’, but declare their own costs.
▪ The work is and is usually carried out on their premises, under their full and direct
control, instructions and management, with their own employees.
▪ The beneficiary remains responsible towards the granting authority for the work
carried out by its affiliated entities and for the recovery of undue payments from
its affiliated entities (if any).
‘Link to the beneficiaries’ means in particular a legal or capital link, which is neither limited to
the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation (see Article 190(1)(b)
FR 2024/250927). This covers:
− permanent legal structures (e.g. the relationship between an association and its
members)
− contractual cooperation not limited to the action (e.g. an existing collaboration
agreement for activities in a field relevant to the action;)
− capital link, i.e.
− direct or indirect control of the beneficiary
− under the same direct or indirect control as the beneficiary
or
− directly or indirectly controlling the beneficiary.
Moreover, it covers not only the case of parent companies or holdings and their daughter
companies or subsidiaries and vice-versa, but also the case of affiliates between themselves
(e.g. entities controlled by the same entity).
Examples:
1. Company A established in France holding 20% of the shares in Company B established in Italy.
However, with 20% of the shares, it has 60% of the voting rights in company B. Therefore,
company A controls company B and both companies may be affiliated entities.
2. Company X and company Y do not control each other, but they are both owned by company Z.
They are both considered affiliated entities.
3. The Ministry A is in accordance with national law the supervisory authority of a national agency.
They can be considered as affiliated entities. Conversely, if the national agency is by statute set up
as independent from the central government, the agency and the Ministry should instead
participate as separate beneficiaries (or other fitting roles).
4. Associations, foundations or other legal entities composed of members — That entity is generally
the beneficiary and the members are the affiliated entities.
5. Joint Research Units (JRU) (i.e. research laboratories/infrastructures created and owned by two
or more different legal entities in order to carry out research) — They do not have a separate legal
personality, but form a single research unit where staff and resources from the different members
are put together to the benefit of all. Though lacking legal personality, they exist physically, with
27 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(1)(b) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
156EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
premises, equipment, and resources that belong to them. A member of the JRU can be the
beneficiary and other members can participate as affiliated entities. The JRU has to meet all the
following conditions:
− scientific and economic unity
− last a certain length of time
− recognised by a public authority.
It is necessary that the JRU itself is recognised by a public authority, i.e. an entity identified as
such under the applicable national law. The beneficiary must provide to the granting authority, a
copy of the resolution, law, decree, decision, attesting the relationship between the beneficiary and
the affiliated entity(ies), or a copy of the document establishing the joint research unit, or any
other document that proves that research facilities are put in a common structure and correspond
to the concept of scientific and economic unit.
Just like beneficiaries, affiliated entities must normally fulfil the conditions for participation
and funding.
Example: Company A established in Germany is a beneficiary in a grant. A owns B, a French
company and also owns C, a company established in a non-EU country not associated to the
programme. B and C may be considered affiliates to A, however only B may participate as
affiliated entity to A, because company C is established in a non-associated third country and is
therefore not eligible. C can instead participate as an associated partner.
Affiliated entities must be listed in Article 8, their tasks must be mentioned in Annex 1 and
their budget in Annex 2.There is NO simplified approval procedure.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the action tasks done by
affiliated entities (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that the affiliated entities comply with the same obligations as
they themselves (mutatis mutandis).
Obligations that must be extended to affiliated entities:
▪ all obligations (mutatis mutandis)
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
affiliated entities.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the affiliated
entities, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the affiliated
entities, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (affiliated entities):
Joint and several liability of affiliated entities — The granting authority may (during
grant preparation) require joint and several liability of an affiliated entity, if:
− the financial capacity of a beneficiary is ‘weak’ and
− the beneficiary mainly coordinates the work of its affiliated entity.
Examples:
1. The financially weak beneficiary is an association and most of the work is carried out by several
of its members as affiliated entities.
2. The financially weak beneficiary is a small company with a substantial part of its work
implemented by a bigger affiliated entity.
3. The proposal submitted by four independent entities established in four Member States is
positively evaluated. The four successful applicants decide to form a legal entity to simplify the
management of the project. The newly established entity will be the beneficiary, i.e. a new legal
entity. The successful applicants will carry out the work as affiliated entities of the new legal entity.
157EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If requested, the affiliated entity must accept joint and several liability with their beneficiary.
In this case, it must sign a declaration (on paper and in blue-ink, using the Annex 3a
generated by the system) to be submitted by the beneficiary at the moment of its accession
to the grant (or amendment adding the affiliated entity). The affiliated entity must send the
original to the beneficiary (by registered post with proof of delivery), who must upload it (as
a scanned PDF copy) in the system.
The liability is for any amount owned by the beneficiary under the Grant Agreement, and up
to the affiliated entity’s maximum EU contribution in Annex 2.
More details on the financial capacity check are available in the Online Manual > Participant
Register > Financial capacity assessment on the Portal.
Entities created in order to manage administrative/financial tasks (including
‘entities with authorisation to administer’) — These are typically legal entities
(foundations, spin-off companies, etc), created or controlled by a beneficiary (usually a public
body like a university/ministry) to handle the financial and administrative aspects of the
beneficiaries’ involvement e.g. in EU actions.
If they handle coordinator tasks (see Article 7) or implement action tasks themselves, they
have to participate as affiliated entity of the beneficiary/coordinator and have to declare their
own costs.
Resources they put at the disposal of their beneficiary for the action implementation should in
principle also be charged by them as affiliated entity.
However, for HE, in case different funding rates are applied for the beneficiary versus the
affiliated entity, the costs can also be declared by the beneficiary:
− if the resources are provided against payment: in accordance with rules of the
appropriate cost category (e.g. Article 6.2.A.3 for personnel put at the disposal of the
beneficiary; Article 6.2.C.2 for equipment or Article 6.2.C.3 for other goods, works and
services)
− if the resources are provided for free: in accordance with the rules on eligibility of in-
kind contributions (see Article 6.1).
Best practice: It is recommended to describe in the DoA Annex 1 the relation between the
beneficiary and the foundation/spin-off and its impact on the Grant Agreement.

ARTICLE 9 — OTHER PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN THE ACTION
9.1 Associated partners
[OPTION 1 for programmes without associated partners: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with associated partners (standard): [OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The
following entities which cooperate with a beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘associated partners’:
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number] [associated partner of [BEN legal name (short
name)]]
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number] [associated partner of [BEN legal name (short
name)]]
[same for more AP]
Associated partners must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in accordance with Article
11. They may not charge costs or contributions to the action and the costs for their tasks are not eligible.
The tasks must be set out in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their contractual obligations under Articles 11 (proper implementation),
12 (conflict of interests), 13 (confidentiality and security), 14 (ethics), 17.2 (visibility), 18 (specific rules for
carrying out action), 19 (information) and 20 (record-keeping) also apply to the associated partners.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the associated partners.]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable] ]
1. Associated partners
Associated partners are entities that implement action tasks, but without receiving EU
funding.
They do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign an accession form), but they
implement parts of the action and are thus often involved actively in the consortium.
Therefore, the Grant Agreement mentions them by name and defines their role (rights and
obligations).
Characteristics of implementation by associated partners:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ They participate at own costs (do not receive EU funding).
▪ The consortium (or, in case the associated partner cooperates with a specific
beneficiary as named in Article 9.1, that beneficiary) remains responsible towards
the granting authority for the work performed by the associated partners.
Associated partners do NOT need to have a (capital or legal) link to any beneficiary (but they
may have one).
159EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Since they do not receive EU funding, associated partners do NOT have to comply with the
eligibility conditions (but they may)).
Associated partners must be listed in Article 9.1, their tasks must be mentioned in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the tasks implemented by
associated partners (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations:
Obligations that must be extended to associated partners:
▪ Proper implementation (see Article 11), including compliance with call conditions
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific9 rules for the action implementation (see Article 18), including
compliance with specific rules set out in Annex 5
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
associated partners (e.g. via contractual arrangements, consortium agreement, etc).
The beneficiaries must also ensure that the associated partners respect the call conditions
and Annex 5.
Example: In Horizon Europe, the Grant Agreement provides for additional obligations in Annex 5
regarding results, e.g. open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications which applies to all such
publications under the Grant Agreement, including publications where associated partners are
involved.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
associated partners, particular concerning the action implementation.

General > Article 9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions
9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions
9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions
[OPTION 1 for programmes with in-kind contributions allowed but not eligible (standard):
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods,
works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge), if necessary for the implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not charge costs or
contributions to the action and the costs for the in-kind contributions are not eligible.
The third parties and their in-kind contributions should be set out in Annex 1.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with in-kind contributions eligible:
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods,
works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge) if necessary for the implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not charge costs or
contributions to the action, but the costs for the in-kind contributions are eligible and may be charged by the
beneficiaries which use them, under the conditions set out in Article 6. The costs will be included in Annex 2
as part of the beneficiaries’ costs.
The third parties and their in-kind contributions should be set out in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the third parties giving in-kind contributions. ]
[OPTION 3 for programmes with in-kind contributions not allowed:
In-kind contributions (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods and services, etc. given by third parties free-of-
charge) are not allowed for the implementation of the action.]
1. Third parties providing in-kind contributions: In-kind contributions allowed but
not eligible
This is the standard rule for most EU programmes. Beneficiaries may use in-kind
contributions provided by third parties, if necessary to implement the action, but they are not
counted towards the project budget (not eligible costs).
Examples (in-kind contributions allowed but not eligible):
1. Civil servant working as a professor in a public university is also working on the action. His salary
is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but by the government (the ministry). It can therefore
not be charged to the EU grant.
2. A entity providing learning spaces for free to the beneficiaries, for example a municipality for an
NGO part of the project.
3. A graphic company providing for free the design of booklets.
In-kind contributions refers only to the case where a third party makes available some
of its resources to a beneficiary for free (i.e. without any payment; new for 2021-2027). In
this case, the beneficiary itself makes no payment and there is therefore NO cost incurred by
the beneficiary. There are therefore normally NO costs that can be charged to the action (—
unless specifically provided for in the Programme Regulation, e.g. for HE).
By contrast, if there is any payment by the beneficiary to the third party for the in-kind
contribution provided, the beneficiary can declare the costs in the appropriate cost category:
− personnel costs for seconded persons (see Article 6.2.A.3)
− renting costs for equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2) or
− purchase costs for other goods, works and services (see Article 6.2.C.3).
161EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Third parties providing in-kind contributions: In-kind contributions eligible
For some EU programmes (only HE), the Programme Regulation (basic act) allows in-kind
contribution costs to be charged to the action.
Examples (in-kind contributions eligible): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university is also working on the action. His salary is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but
by the government (the ministry). In Horizon Europe, the beneficiary may charge these costs to the
grant, even if they are incurred by a third party (the ministry/government).
The eligibility conditions for such costs are set out in Article 6.1. However, in kind
contributions against payment ARE NOT a budget category: Depending on the type of cost,
they must be declared in, and comply with, the fitting budget category (e.g. personnel costs,
equipment).
In-kind contributions and the third parties contributing them must be mentioned in Annex 1
(simplified approval procedure; see below).
Moreover, if in-kind contributions are charged to the action, the beneficiaries must also
ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, the European Court
of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks,
reviews, audits and investigations on the third parties, and in particular to audit their costs. If
access is denied by the third party, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (in-kind contributions eligible):
Simplified approval procedure (new in-kind contributions) — For programmes where
in-kind contributions are eligible (only HE), if the need for an in-kind contribution was not
known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to introduce
the new contribution into the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure; for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the
beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting authority might not approve the new
contribution and reject the costs at interim or final payment-stage later on.

carrying out action), 19 (information) and 20 (record-keeping) also apply to the subcontractors.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the subcontractors. ]
1. Subcontractors
Subcontractors do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA), but they
often implement important parts of the action (i.e. action tasks specified in Annex 1) and
thus may need to be involved actively in the consortium. Therefore, the Grant Agreement
mentions them and defines their role (rights and obligations).
Characteristics of subcontractors:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ charges a price, which usually includes a profit (— this distinguishes it from
affiliated entities; see Article 8), to be declared as subcontracting costs by a
beneficiary.
▪ The work is carried out without the direct supervision of the beneficiary and is not
hierarchically subordinate to the beneficiary (— this distinguishes it from action
tasks implemented by in-house consultants; see Article 6.2.A.2).
▪ The motivation is pecuniary, not the work on the project itself. The subcontractor
is paid by the beneficiary in exchange for its work.
▪ The beneficiary remains fully responsible towards the granting authority for action
tasks performed by its subcontractors.
Example (subcontract): A Grant Agreement for an action on nature reserves describes in
Annex 1 two action tasks. The first task concerns a comparative study of water quality in the
reserve, which the beneficiary’s employee will compile after taking and sending water samples
to laboratories. The lab work is necessary for the implementation of the action but only a
subactivity of compiling the study (the action task), therefore it will fall under purchase costs
(see Article 6.2.C). The second task concerns an aerial survey of the water bodies for which the
beneficiary does not have the necessary know-how and assets and therefore subcontracts to a
service provider who will implement the survey (the action task) through activities like aerial
photography and analysis.
163EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The action tasks to be subcontracted and the estimated costs (not necessarily the
subcontractor, especially if not known yet) must be identified and justified in Annex 1 (Article
6.2.B; simplified approval procedure; see below).
Normally you are NOT obliged to give information about the names of the subcontractors
selected (in DoA Annex 1 or periodic report), but many programmes require this information
indirectly through the detailed budget/cost reporting table.
Best practice: If you think that there is an issue with a subcontractor that might impact the
eligibility of subcontracting costs (e.g. potential conflict of interest; subcontractor not in
compliance with the call conditions or subject to sanctions, etc), inform the granting
authority and ask for specific guidance.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the subcontracted action
tasks by the subcontractors (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations:
Obligations that must be extended to subcontractors:
▪ Proper implementation (see Article 11), including compliance with call conditions
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18), including
compliance with specific rules set out in Annex 5
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
subcontractors (e.g. via contractual arrangements, consortium agreement, etc).
The beneficiaries must also ensure that the subcontractors respect the the call conditions and
Annex 5.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
subcontractors, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
subcontractor, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (subcontractors):
Simplified approval procedure (new subcontracts) — If the need for a subcontract was
not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to
introduce the subcontracting of one or more tasks in Annex 1 (see Article 39) or, if allowed,
flag it in the periodic report (simplified approval procedure; allowed for most programmes;
for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk that the
granting authority might not approve the new subcontracting of the task(s) and reject the
costs at interim or final payment-stage later on.

The beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF,
Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the recipients.]
1. Recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)
Recipients of financial support to third parties (grants, prizes or other) do not become party
to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA) and are not part of the consortium. They do not
implement action tasks, but they benefit from them and receive (indirectly) a part of the EU
funding. Therefore, the Grant Agreement defines their role (rights and obligations).
Characteristics of FSTP recipients:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They do not perform action tasks, but the financial support given to them is part of
an action task specified in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ They receive financial support from the grant (e.g. sub-grant or prize money), to
be declared as financial support to third parties cost by a beneficiary.
The beneficiaries remain responsible towards the granting authority for the proper use of the
funding by the recipients.
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations, where
relevant/applicable based on the nature of the action:
Obligations that must be extended to FSTP recipients:
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding, as appropriate (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18)
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
165EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
recipients (e.g. via cascading call conditions or contractual arrangements, scholarship
agreement, rules of contest, etc).
Moreover, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
recipients, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
recipient, the costs will be rejected.

consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. Non-EU participants
Non-EU participants are not a separate category of participants, but simply participants (e.g.
beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner, subcontractor) that are not legally
established in one of the EU Member States. They can usually participate in EU funding
programmes, if:
− their country is associated to the programme (so-called ‘associated country’) —
standard case
OR
− if the programme is open to participation and funding of entities from third countries
— rare (e.g. HE, RELEX).
Since non-EU participants are normally not subject to EU law, the Grant Agreement recalls
the most important principles and makes them contractually binding. Thus, participants
undertake to comply with all their obligations under the Grant Agreement and commit to:
− respect key principles, such as fundamental rights, EU values and ethical principles,
environmental and labour standards, security of information rules, respect for IPR
protection and privacy
− use appropriate audit standards as well as qualified and independent external auditors
− allow for checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the bodies mentioned in Article
25 (e.g. granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-
Fraud Office (OLAF))
167EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Moreover, since non-EU participants are regularly located outside the jurisdiction of the EU
courts (General Court, Court of Justice), disputes will be settled by the courts of Brussels,
Belgium (— unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU court
judgments).
Specific cases (non-EU participants):
International organisations (IOs) — International organisations do NOT fall under Article
10.1 (nor under the option for non-EU participants in the declaration of honour (DoH) to be
signed before grant signature), since they do NOT count as participants from non-EU
countries.
Formally speaking, place of establishment of international organisations is irrelevant and for
the purposes of the Grant Agreement they are considered as neither EU nor non-EU entities.
They have a special status (supra-national)and are covered specifically by the provisions of
Article 10.2.
If an international organisation is pillar-assessed, the provisions of Article 10.3 apply in
addition.

[OPTION 1 for programmes without international organisations: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with international organisations (standard): Participants which are international
organisations (IOs; if any) undertake to comply with their obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical principles,
environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information, intellectual property rights,
visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use either independent public officers or
external auditors which comply with comparable standards as those set out in EU Directive
2006/43/EC35
- for the controls under Article 25: to allow for the checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the
bodies mentioned in that Article, taking into account the specific agreements concluded by them
and the EU (if any).
For such participants, nothing in the Agreement will be interpreted as a waiver of their privileges or
immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or international law.
Special rules on applicable law and dispute settlement apply (see Article 43 and Data Sheet, Point 5).]
35 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and
consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. International organisations (IOs)
International organisations are not a separate category of participants, but simply
participants (e.g. beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner, subcontractor) with a
specific legal form and status under international public law and validated as such in the
Participant Register.
Examples: International organisations are for example UN organisations and specialised
agencies (e.g. WHO, UNHCR, UNEP, UNESCO), ESA, ECMWF, OCCAR.
They can usually participate in EU funding programmes, unless the programme explicitly
provides otherwise (e.g. in HE, international European research organisations (IEROs) can
always participate with funding, while other international organisations can participate with
funding only under certain circumstances set out in the work programme/call conditions).
Since international organisations are normally not subject to EU law, the Grant Agreement
recalls the most important principles and obligations regarding audits and controls and makes
them contractually binding.
In addition, Article 10.2 acknowledges that nothing in the Grant Agreement will be
interpreted as a waiver of the privileges and immunities set out in their constituent
documents and recognized under international law.
Thus, for instance,:
− enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU or decisions on administrative sanctions
(i.e. exclusion or financial penalties; see Articles 22 and 34) will normally not be
directed at international organisations
169EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− international organisations agree with the granting authority on the applicable law that
should apply to the Grant Agreement (including no applicable law; see Article 43.1).
− dispute settlement is normally not brought before national or EU courts but referred to
the Permanent Court of Arbitration (see Article 43.2).
Additional specific rules apply moreover if the international organisation is also pillar-
assessed (see Article 10.3).

General > Article 10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
[OPTION 1 for programmes without pillar-assessed entities: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with pillar-assessed entities: Pillar-assessed participants (if any) may rely on
their own systems, rules and procedures, in so far as they have been positively assessed and do not call into
question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and procedures which
participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control system, accounting system, external
audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and exclusion, information on recipients and protection of
personal data; see Article 157 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in
particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards, rules and
procedures
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in accordance with usual
accounting practices
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, pre-financing guarantees are not needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their regular internal
or external auditors and in accordance with their internal financial regulations and
procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if those practices
are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no recovery if
the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue amounts from the third party
receiving the support (including legal proceedings) and non-recovery is not due to an error or
negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be conducted taking into
account the rules and procedures specifically agreed between them and the framework
agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the participant’s internal
rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment will be
calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for execution only after
termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into before the pre-information letter was
received and could not reasonably be terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated for damage it
sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not
implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the damage is due to an
infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures or due to a violation of third
parties’ rights by the participant or one of its employees or individual for whom the employees
are responsible.
171EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do purchases,
subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance with their internal rules and
procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal standards, rules
and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of equal treatment of
applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use), communication,
dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- specific rules for carrying out the action (Article 18)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems, rules and
procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules and procedures
that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU, may moreover —
under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach
the principle of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries) — rely on provisions set out in that framework
agreement. ]
1. Pillar-assessed entities
Pillar-assessed entities are not a separate category of participants not a separate category of
participants, but simply participants (e.g. beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner)
that are also ‘pillar-assessed’.
Article 10.3 applies only to entities with a positive pillar-assessment. Entities with
ongoing pillar-assessment procedures must apply the standard rules under the Grant
Agreement until they fulfil the requirements to benefit from the special status provided for
in Article 10.3 (i.e. having a positive pillar assessment).
The special provisions in Article 10 may apply cumulatively for entities with multiple
statuses. Thus if an international organisation participates in a consortium and is also pillar-
assessed, both Article 10.2 and 10.3 will apply.
172EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The ‘pillar assessment’ is a special ex-ante assessment of the rules, systems and procedures
used for managing funds in accordance with Article 157 of the EU Financial Regulation
2024/250928. It provides the granting authority with assurance that the entity can offer a
similar level of protection of the budget as the Commission when it manages EU funds.
Since the pillar assessment ensures that the granting authority can rely on the systems, rules
and procedures of such entities, they can rely on those systems, rules and procedures also
for the grant, provided that:
− the systems, rules and procedures used have actually been positively assessed
Example: An entity has been pillar-assessed but the auditors had material findings regarding
the internal audit capacity leading to a negative internal control pillar result. In this case, the
granting authority cannot rely on the entity’s own rules in this respect and the entity cannot use
its own internal auditors to draw up the CFS for the activities under the Grant Agreement.
− the application of own systems, rules and procedures does not call into question the
decision awarding the grant and does not lead to a breach of the principle of equal
treatment.
Thus, if pillar-assessed entities apply in a call for proposals they must comply with all the call
conditions (IPR protection, security, ethics, etc) and the provisions of the Grant Agreement
(rules on electronic management and communication, reporting and monitoring, payment
arrangements, etc), even if these might not be in line with their internal practice (pillar-
assessed or not). The rules of the pillar-assessed entity can therefore only be used, if they do
not contradict the conditions set out in the call or the Grant Agreement.
Examples:
1. Financial support to third parties (FSTP): A beneficiary has been positively assessed for the
grants pillar. Normally, it could therefore rely on its own rules and procedures when giving FSTP in
the form of grants. However, if the call conditions stipulate specific criteria for the provision of
FSTP (e.g. because these are necessary to achieve the objectives of the call) then the pillar-
assessed entity has to follow the criteria provided for in the call, irrespective of its own positively-
assessed practices. The application of other rules would call into question the award decision since
the FSTP would not comply with the conditions of the call.
2. Subcontracting: A beneficiary has been positively assessed for the procurement pillar.
Normally, it could therefore rely on its own rules and procedures for e.g. subcontracting. However,
if the call conditions stipulate specific security provisions for subcontracting to protect the EU
security interests (e.g. the exclusion of contractors not established in EU Member States) then the
pillar-assessed entity has to follow the criteria provided for in the call irrespective of its own
positively-assessed practices, its own membership etc. The application of other rules would put the
EU security interests at risk and would thus call into question the award decision.
If the pillar assessment resulted in findings that require remedial measures (i.e. ‘supervisory
measures’ in the meaning of Article 157(3) EU Financial Regulation 2024/250929) for certain
pillars, the pillar-assessed entity must apply these remedial measures, mutatis mutandis,
also for the grant (if it would like to rely on its own systems, rules and procedures).
Example: A pillar-assessed entity is a beneficiary in a Grant Agreement that requires the provision
of financial support to third parties (FSTP) in the form of grants and the subsequent publication of
recipient information. The entity has been positively assessed in the grants pillar; however, the
auditors had findings in the publication pillar. If the Commission therefore imposes supervisory
measures requiring the pillar-assessed entity to publish regularly all grant recipients that profit
from EU funds on the entity’s website, the pillar-assessed entity will have to follow this measure
also for the financial support to third parties given under the Grant Agreement, if it intends to rely
on its own systems, rules and procedures.
28 [old Financial Regulation: Article 154 Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
29 [old Financial Regulation: Article 154(3) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
173EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The application of remedial/supervisory measures for failed pillars should not lead to a
situation where the pillar-assessed entity is subject to stricter rules than other participants,
i.e. obligations that go beyond the requirements set out in the Grant Agreement. In this case
the pillar-assessed entity can choose to apply the grant rules instead of the agreed
remedial/supervisory measures.
The granting authority must be immediately informed of any change to the systems, rules
and procedures. If the pillar-assessed entity relies on systems, rules and procedures that
have not been positively assessed, the costs and contributions may be rejected and the grant
reduced.
Specific rules apply in particular with respect to cases of recovery, liability, suspension and
termination owing to the specific nature of pillar-assessed entities (usually public law bodies,
international organisations etc.) and their frame of cooperation with the granting authority.
List of specific rules for pillar-assessed entities:
▪ Recovery: If a pillar-assessed entity provides financial support to third parties
(FSTP) and eventually it turns out (e.g. following a check by the pillar-assessed
entity) that the recipients have received undue amounts, the pillar-assessed entity
should try to recover the undue amounts from the recipients and can do so,
following its own positively assessed rules and procedures. These amounts would
normally be considered as ineligible costs under the Grant Agreement. However, if
despite best efforts by the pillar-assessed entity the undue amounts cannot be
recovered from the recipients, the granting authority will also not recover the
corresponding amount from the pillar-assessed entity (unless the non-recovery is
due to error or negligence on part of the pillar-assessed entity).
▪ Liability: Normally, participants have to compensate the granting authority for
damages they caused in connection to the implementation of action (see Article
33.2). However, pillar-assessed entities will not have to compensate the granting
authority for such damages if the pillar-assessed entity was in compliance with its
own positively-assessed rules and procedures and did not violate the rights of any
third parties.
▪ Suspension: Normally, if the Grant Agreement is suspended, cost incurred during
the suspension period will not be eligible. However, for pillar assessed entities
costs may be eligible even during grant suspension to ensure the resumption of
the action after the suspension and to serve payments under legal commitments
such as purchase and subcontracts which were concluded by the pillar-assessed
entity for the implementation of the action before the pillar-assessed entity was
informed of a possible suspension, provided the payment obligations under these
commitments can themselves not be temporarily stopped (e.g. suspended for the
period of the Grant Agreement suspension).
▪ Termination: Similarly, in case of Grant Agreement termination, pillar-assessed
entities may be reimbursed for (unavoidable) cost for legal commitments such as
purchase- and subcontracts which were concluded by the pillar-assessed entity for
the implementation of the action before information on a possible termination was
received, even if execution of the contracts would only take place after the
payment of the balance. As in the case of suspension, the pillar-assessed entity
has to take all reasonable effort to reduce such cost e.g. by terminating the
contracts at the earliest opportunity.
174EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If there is an applicable framework agreement within the meaning of Article 131 EU Financial
Regulation 2024/2509 (i.e. Financial Framework Partnership Agreement (FFPA))30 concluded
between the European Commission and the pillar-assessed entity, the grant-relevant
provisions in the financial framework partnership agreement may be applied, provided they
do not fall under the list of provisions that would breach the principle of equal treatment or
call into question the decision awarding the grant , e.g. regarding audits.
Record-keeping — If a pillar-assessed entity relies on its own positively-assessed rules for
record-keeping, it must still ensure that these record-keeping rules are in line with obligations
under the Grant Agreement, e.g. record-keeping must be done in a way that allows checks,
reviews and audits (under the rules of a financial framework partnership agreement, if applicable)
and follow the rules for recording of time worked on the action for the calculation of personnel
costs.

SECTION 2 RULES FOR CARRYING OUT THE ACTION
General > Article 11 — Proper implementation of the action
ARTICLE 11 — PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION
ARTICLE 11 — PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION
11.1 Obligation to properly implement the action
The beneficiaries must implement the action as described in Annex 1 and in compliance with the provisions
of the Agreement, the call conditions and all legal obligations under applicable EU, international and national
law.
11.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Proper implementation of the action
The action must be properly implemented, i.e. implemented in accordance with the
beneficiaries’ obligations. These obligations include the obligations stemming explicitly from
the Grant Agreement but also include any other rules applicable to the activities of the
project. The obligations to properly implement the action requires:
− that the action (i.e. the work) must be carried out as described in the description of
the action (DoA; Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement)
− compliance with the provisions of the Agreement (other than those set out in the DoA;
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement)
− compliance with the call conditions as set out in all the documents accompanying the
call for proposals
AND
− compliance with all the applicable provisions of EU, international and national law.
The requirement to properly implement the action is a general obligation to implement the
grant in good faith in compliance with any applicable rules (whether specifically listed in the Grant
Agreement or not) at any step of implementation. It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to be aware
of this and apply it to their project.
The work must be done properly (good quality) and on time. Participants must prevent
delays (or reduce them as much as possible). In addition, important delays should be
immediately signalled to the granting authority (see Article 19).
When implementing the action as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of
the Grant Agreement), all work on the project must comply with the obligations set out in
other parts of the Grant Agreement, in particular the rules for carrying out the action (e.g.
data protection, confidentiality; see also Annex 5).
Example: As part of the activities set out in your description of the action, you are
subcontracting the conduct of a survey. Even though you have to ensure the proper technical
conduct of the survey as described in the action and ensure submission of the deliverable within
the time limits of the action under the terms of the grant, you also have to comply with the rules
176EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
on subcontracting, any applicable data protection rules etc. Otherwise, the granting authority
may reject cost or reduce your grant even if you provided your deliverable in good quality and on
time.
This means in practice that full compliance with all obligations at all time is expected.
Apart from obligations explicitly specified in the Grant Agreement and its Annexes, the
beneficiaries must also comply with the call conditions (e.g. conditions on geographic
eligibility, eligible participants, financial support to third parties (FSTP), specific cost eligibility
rules, etc). These conditions must be fulfilled throughout the implementation of the project.
Example: The call conditions provide that entities subject to EU restrictive measures (also called
‘sanctions’) cannot participate in the grant in any capacity, including as associated partners or
subcontractors.
The granting authorities cannot know in advance and therefore cannot specify all possible
obligations that a beneficiary may have in connection with the activities under the Grant
Agreement. Accordingly the Grant Agreement includes the general obligations to comply with
all the applicable provisions of EU, international and national law (including general
principles, such as fundamental rights, values and ethical principles).
If activities take place in several countries, the participants must comply with the national
law of the country in which they are established AND that of the country (or countries) where
the action is implemented.
Example: Each beneficiary must comply in particular with the labour law applicable to the
personnel working on the action and must fulfil the tax and social obligations related to the
activities it carries out under the applicable national law. If a part of the activities is done in
another country, the applicable rules must be respected.
This obligation also requires compliance with other legal acts and other binding or non-
binding rules and guidance in the area concerned (see definition of ‘Applicable EU,
international and national law’ in Article 2). This includes applicable professional code of
conducts, sectoral guidance, but also covers relevant legal acts such as work programmes
adopted by the granting authority or guidance provided by the granting authority.
Example: Activities in the course of the project may require the involvement of certain
professions whose work is governed by sector- or profession-specific guidelines or codes of
conducts, e.g. in healthcare. The proper implementation of the action would normally oblige the
beneficiary to comply with all such guidelines or codes of conduct in concerned areas of work
(unless the description of the action explicitly requires otherwise, e.g. to test innovative new
methods, within the boundaries of binding rules).
It also includes compliance with relevant legal acts such as the conditions set out in work
programmes adopted by the granting authority and applicable to the action, or any guidance
provided by the granting authority.
Specific cases (proper implementation):
Conflicts between applicable rules — The beneficiaries remain fully responsible to plan
and implement their action in a way that ensures the exercise of the rights by the granting
authority/other EU bodies, including for checks, reviews, audits and investigations. If conflicts
with applicable (e.g. national/third country) rules prevent the exercise of these rights (e.g.
access to records or results) the granting authority may reject costs, reduce the grant or
terminate the participation of the beneficiary (or the Grant Agreement).
Conflicts with security rules — Be aware that national/third country security requirements
(national/third country security classification, national export restrictions, etc) may affect the
project implementation (and even put it at risk). It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to avoid
this and to keep your project free of such restrictions, either by adapting the action or by
obtaining all necessary authorisations to be able to comply with your obligations under the
Grant Agreement (see also specific case above). Any potential security issues should
immediately be notified to the granting authority.
177EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: According to national rules a personnel security clearance (PSC) may be required for
accessing information even below CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL level. If this prevents the
granting authority, ECA, OLAF or EPPO from exercising their rights, the reference to conflicting
national rules will not release the beneficiary from contractual obligations and the granting
authority will take the necessary measures (e.g. rejection of cost due to lack of supporting
documents).

General > Article 12 — Conflict of interests
ARTICLE 12 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
ARTICLE 12 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
12.1 Conflict of interests
The beneficiaries must take all measures to prevent any situation where the impartial and objective
implementation of the Agreement could be compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life,
political or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect interest (‘conflict of interests’).
They must formally notify the granting authority without delay of any situation constituting or likely to lead
to a conflict of interests and immediately take all the necessary steps to rectify this situation.
The granting authority may verify that the measures taken are appropriate and may require additional
measures to be taken by a specified deadline.
12.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28)
and the grant or the beneficiary may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Conflict of interests
The beneficiaries must ensure that the action is implemented impartially and objectively, as
described in the Grant Agreement. They must do their best to take all measures to avoid
conflicts of interest. Persons working on the action should in particular:
− refrain from taking any action which may bring them into a situation of conflict of
interests
− take appropriate measures to prevent conflicts of interest from arising in the tasks
under their responsibility
− take appropriate measures to address any situations which may objectively be
perceived as a conflict of interests
AND
− report any conflict of interests, or situations that could be perceived as a conflict of
interests.
Best Practice: It is recommended that the beneficiaries have a system in place that allows (at
least) persons working on the action to declare conflicts of interests and clear rules how to
address such situations. Awareness-raising activities should be carried out regularly.
‘Conflicts of interests’ can negatively affect the action and may lead to a rejection of cost or
grant reduction, in particular if a conflict of interests affects the action’s implementation in
terms of:
− quality, e.g. if a conflict of interest leads to persons/contractors not best qualified for
the work
OR
− cost, e.g. if a conflict of interest leads to award of (sub)contract’s or purchases not
offering best value for money or lowest price.
179EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Conflicts of interests must be avoided irrespective of whether they actually affect quality or
cost, or whether the persons involved actually gain any benefit (or not).
Conflicts may be resulting from direct or indirect interests in relation to:
− family or emotional ties, while often connected, avoidance of conflict of interests
due to ‘family’ or ‘emotional life’ are separate obligations. An emotional bond between
family members is therefore not required for a person’s impartiality to be
compromised by reasons involving family, e.g. subcontracts with business owned by
family members, even if no close emotional ties exist
Examples:
Direct interest: A person works for a beneficiary who plans to subcontract a task. A company
owned by the person’s spouse may submit an offer. In this case the person working for the
beneficiary could have a direct interest in awarding the spouse’s company (and therefore would
need to declare a conflict of interest and abstain from being involved in the preparation and
award of the subcontract).
Indirect interest: A person works for a beneficiary who plans to subcontract a task. A
company may submit an offer. The person’s spouse my work for a usual supplier of that
company, or my own facilities or land that would be used by that company in case it
implements the subcontract. In this case the person working for the beneficiary could have an
indirect interest in awarding the company (and therefore would need to declare a conflict of
interest and abstain from being involved in the preparation and award of the subcontract).
− political or national affinity, this concerns situations where beneficiaries or third
parties may be chosen, or activities carried out, based on political or national
considerations (although a mere link with beliefs, views, opinions or preferences of the
person does not automatically constitute a personal interest)
Example: The CEO of a beneficiaries selects a contractor, or a site for a demonstration, not
based on objective and verifiable criteria on the merits, but instead selects a compatriot as
contractor or a demonstration site due to the political party membership of the local mayor.
− economic interests which include, but are not limited to, direct financial benefits
Examples:
1. A beneficiary or a person working for a beneficiary subcontracts work to another legal entity
because it is a shareholder in this other legal entity.
2. A professor working for a beneficiary (a university) subcontracts work to a consultancy firm
in which the professor is a partner.
3. A beneficiary agrees to award a subcontract to a company in exchange for preferential
treatment in that company’s own future contracting.
4. A person working for a beneficiary receives an offer for a subcontract from a company for
which the person has applied for a position.
− other direct and indirect interests, which can include reception of gifts or
hospitality, non-economic interests, or result from involvement with e.g. non-
governmental organisations (even if non-remunerated), resulting in competing duties
of loyalty between one entity the person owes a duty to and another person or entity
the person owes a duty.
Examples:
1. To discuss its proposed offer, a potential subcontractor has invited staff of the beneficiary to
its premises, including hotel accommodation, dinner and gifts.
2. A person involved in subcontracting of a beneficiary is also holding an office in a local NGO.
The President of the NGO owns a company that may become the subcontractor.
If there is a (risk of) a conflict of interests, the coordinator must inform the granting
authority so that steps can be agreed to resolve the situation and avoid cost rejection or
reduction of the grant.
180EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This may result in the requirement by the granting authority to put in place certain
measures, in particular for persons with a perceivable risk of conflict of interest to withdraw
from any decision-making that could affect their direct or indirect interest.

General > Article 13 — Confidentiality and security
ARTICLE 13 — CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
ARTICLE 13 — CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
13.1 Sensitive information
The parties must keep confidential any data, documents or other material (in any form) that is identified as
sensitive in writing (‘sensitive information’) — during the implementation of the action and for at least until
the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6).
If a beneficiary requests, the granting authority may agree to keep such information confidential for a longer
period.
Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, they may use sensitive information only to implement the
Agreement.
The beneficiaries may disclose sensitive information to their personnel or other participants involved in the
action only if they:
(a) need to know it in order to implement the Agreement and
(b) are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
The granting authority may disclose sensitive information to its staff and to other EU institutions and bodies.
It may moreover disclose sensitive information to third parties, if:
(a) this is necessary to implement the Agreement or safeguard the EU financial interests and
(b) the recipients of the information are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
The confidentiality obligations no longer apply if:
(a) the disclosing party agrees to release the other party
(b) the information becomes publicly available, without breaching any confidentiality obligation
(c) the disclosure of the sensitive information is required by EU, international or national law.
Specific confidentiality rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
13.2 Classified information
The parties must handle classified information in accordance with the applicable EU, international or national
law on classified information (in particular, Decision 2015/444 and its implementing rules).
Deliverables which contain classified information must be submitted according to special procedures agreed
with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted only after explicit approval (in writing)
from the granting authority.
Classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants involved in the action
implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the granting authority.
Specific security rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
13.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
182EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Sensitive information — Confidentiality
If the project involves, uses or generates information that should not be made public (e.g.
commercially sensitive information, business or trade secrets, confidential market data,
valuable results not yet protected by intellectual property rights, security-sensitive
information, etc), it should be identified and handled as ‘sensitive’ in accordance with the
provisions in Article 13.1 (and Annex 5, if the Grant Agreement sets out specific rules for the
programme, e.g. HE).
For actions raising specific concerns, such as security or public order (e.g. involving
strategic assets), beneficiaries may have to comply with additional obligations before and
after the grant award. For example, in some programmes (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF), actions
linked to security concerns may have to undergo a security review before selection and may
be made subject to specific security recommendations in Annex 1.
Sensitive information (former ‘confidential’; new for 2021-2027) must be kept confidential —
during the action and for at least five years afterwards (see Data Sheet, Point 6) — meaning
that they may be disclosed only within the strict limits of what is allowed under Article 13, in
particular to implement the Grant Agreement or protect the EU financial interests.
The confidentiality obligation is a minimum obligation: Beneficiaries may extend the period
and agree to additional confidentiality-related obligations among themselves (for example,
for access for other participants). Moreover, they may ask the granting authority to extend
the period. This request must explain why and clearly identify the sensitive information
concerned.
Best practice: In order to avoid issues, it is recommended that beneficiaries inform each
other and the granting authority in case they know about laws that would require disclosing
sensitive information. This can allow to work together to minimise any negative effects.
2. EU-classified information
If the project uses or generates information that is (or must be) classified, additional rules
and procedures will apply in line with Article 13.2 (and Annex 5, if the Grant Agreement sets
out specific rules for the programme).
These are in particular:
− security rules for protecting EU classified information set out in Decision No
2015/44431 and its implementing rules on classified grants32 and programme security
instruction (PSI), if any (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF,) and
− national rules on the protection of classified information.
31 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p.53).
32 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2021/259 of 10 February 2021 laying down implementing rules on
industrial security with regard to classified grants (OJ L 58, 19.2.2021, p. 55).
183EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In addition, security of information agreements concluded by the EU with third countries or
international organisations may also be indirectly relevant (for instance, may be a pre-
condition for awarding (or not) the grant by the granting authority), but they do not impose
any direct obligations for on the consortium (do not directly apply to them).
Projects expected to involve EU classified information (EUCI) will have to undergo a security
review procedure before selection, to set EU classification levels and other security
recommendations (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF).
Example: Some of the information produced by a project could potentially be used to plan
terrorist attacks or avoid detection of criminal activities.
For more guidance on classification of information and security obligations, see How to handle
security-sensitive projects, Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe
projects and Guidelines on the classification of information in Digital Europe projects.
3. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional rules may be set out in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF
CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM, EDF).

General > Article 14 — Ethics and values
ARTICLE 14 — ETHICS AND VALUES
ARTICLE 14 — ETHICS AND VALUES
14.1 Ethics
The action must be carried out in line with the highest ethical standards and the applicable EU, international
and national law on ethical principles.
Specific ethics rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
14.2 Values
The beneficiaries must commit to and ensure the respect of basic EU values (such as respect for human
dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities).
Specific rules on values (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
14.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Ethics
The action must ensure ethics compliance, this obligation is twofold:
− the action is in line with the highest ethical standards and
− the action ensures compliance with applicable international, EU and national law.
Main ethical principles:
▪ Respecting human dignity and integrity
▪ Ensuring honesty and transparency and notably getting free and informed consent
(as well as assent whenever relevant)
▪ Protecting vulnerable persons
▪ Ensuring privacy and confidentiality
▪ Promoting justice and inclusiveness
▪ Minimising harm and maximising benefit
▪ Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially in developing
countries
▪ Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction and
refinement in animal research
▪ Respecting and protecting the environment and present/future generations
The key sources of EU and international law are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols (for
other texts). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (UN CRPD).
Activities exposed to ethics risks usually run an ethics review as part of their grant selection
procedures (HE, DEP and EDF). Other programmes may perform manual checks.
185EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For more guidance, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment (can be used for all
programmes and especially for HE, DEP and EDF).
2. Values
All EU policies and programmes must respect the values on which the EU is founded and
which are set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Furthermore, the EU
institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the Member States, when implementing
EU law, must respect the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights
of the European Union.
Based on Article 14.2, during the implementation of the action, the beneficiaries must commit
to and ensure the respect of EU values.
EU values:
▪ respect for human dignity
▪ freedom
▪ democracy
▪ equality, including equality between women and men, non-discrimination
▪ rule of law
▪ respect for human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities
▪ pluralism, tolerance, justice, solidarity.
Accordingly, there can be no discrimination based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin,
genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a
national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation during the
implementation of the action or work programme.
3. Breaches of ethics or EU values
Breaches of ethics or EU values under this Article may lead to grant reductions (see Article
28) or other measures described in Chapter 5, such as rejection of costs or contributions,
payment deadline suspension, payment suspension, GA suspension, beneficiary or GA
termination, damages and administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures
and/or financial penalties).
Be aware that these measures may be taken not only when the beneficiary itself
breached the EU values, also when other persons and entities, such as its affiliated entities,
associated partners, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)
(see Articles 8, 9.1, 9.3 and 9.4) OR persons having powers of representation, decision-
making or control, or persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant breach
them (see Article 32).
Examples: Termination of a beneficiary because a person having powers of representation for the
beneficiary makes a public statement which discriminates against religion or belief.
4. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional rules may be set out in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF
EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, EDF, EU4H, Euratom, RELEX).

ARTICLE 15 — DATA PROTECTION
15.1 Data processing by the granting authority
Any personal data under the Agreement will be processed under the responsibility of the data controller of
the granting authority in accordance with and for the purposes set out in the Portal Privacy Statement.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission, an EU regulatory or executive agency,
joint undertaking or other EU body, the processing will be subject to Regulation 2018/172538.
38 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data,
and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).
1. Processing of personal data (by the EU)
The granting authority will process personal data in compliance with Regulation 2018/172533
and as set out in the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy Statement.
When the granting authority collects and processes personal data under the Grant
Agreement, national data protection law is NOT applicable and will NOT be accepted as a
justification for not complying with obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Personal data will be processed only for the purpose of implementing, managing and
monitoring the grant implementation/compliance with the provisions under the Grant
Agreement or protecting EU financial interests (including controls on eligibility of costs,
proper implementation of the action and compliance with other obligations).
The level of detail of the data requested will depend on the process and situation and will be
limited to what is necessary (data minimisation).
The processing of personal data under the Grant Agreement (manual or electronic) is notified
(by the data controller) to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) of the European Commission. In
addition, for processing that implies specific risks to the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects (e.g. processing of data relating to health), the European Data Protection Supervisor
(EDPS) will be consulted.
The notifications are available via the Register of the DPO1 (and describe the processing
operations, legal basis, security safeguards, retention period, possible data transfer, etc).

2. Right to access and correct personal data
Persons whose data is being processed (data subjects) can contact the data controller or the
DPO (via the contact information in the Privacy Statement), to:
− correct errors in the data, block access or delete their data
− complain about the data collection and use, and claim compensation for any damage.
3. Complaints to the EDPS
Persons whose data is being processed (data subjects) can also lodge a complaint with the
European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) (i.e. the independent supervisory authority for
data processing by EU institutions).
Best practice: Please contact first contact the data controller (see above) to clarify concerns
or solve problems regarding your data.

15.2 Data processing by the beneficiaries
15.2 Data processing by the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must process personal data under the Agreement in compliance with the applicable EU,
international and national law on data protection (in particular, Regulation 2016/67939).
They must ensure that personal data is:
- processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subjects
- collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is
incompatible with those purposes
- adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed
- accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
- kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
purposes for which the data is processed and
- processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the data.
The beneficiaries may grant their personnel access to personal data only if it is strictly necessary for
implementing, managing and monitoring the Agreement. The beneficiaries must ensure that the personnel is
under a confidentiality obligation.
The beneficiaries must inform the persons whose data are transferred to the granting authority and provide
them with the Portal Privacy Statement.
15.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
39 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (‘GDPR’) (OJ L 119,
4.5.2016, p. 1).
1. Processing of personal data (by the Consortium)
During the implementation of the action, the beneficiaries will collect and process personal
data, e.g. of their own staff, staff of other participants, and may also share such data with
the granting authority. In all such instances, the personal data must be processed in line with
the provisions under the Grant Agreement, in particular in compliance with applicable EU and
national law on data protection (in particular, with the General Data Protection Regulation
2016/67934 (GDPR)).

189EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The data protection obligations (e.g. to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully,
fairly and in a transparent manner) are a contractual obligation under the Grant Agreement
and apply to all beneficiaries, irrespective of whether the GDPR is directly applicable to them
or whether applicable national law provides for such requirements (or not).
According to those rules, personal data must be processed according to certain principles and
conditions (see EDPB data protection guide for small business).
‘Personal data’ means any information, private or professional, which relates to an identified
or identifiable natural person (for the full definition, see Article 4(1) GDPR).
− name, surname, phone numbers (e.g. staff)
− identification numbers, such as an individual’s client number, an individual’s employee
number
− a booking reference
− email addresses, location data
− photos, videos and audio recordings containing images or sounds of individuals.
Processing of special categories of data is in principle prohibited, except in the specific
circumstances set out in Article 9(2) GDPR.
Data that reveals information about health, sex life or sexual orientation, racial or ethnic
origin political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, biometric and genetic data or trade
union membership (so-called ‘sensitive data’) is subject to specific rules for the processing, in
order to protect it more.
‘Processing’ means any operation (or set of operations) which is performed on personal data,
either manually or by automatic means. This includes:
− − collection
− − recording
− − organisation
− - structuring
− - storage
− - adaptation or alteration
− − retrieval and consultation
− − use
− − disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available
− − alignment or combination
− − restriction, erasure or destruction.
190EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Examples (processing of personal data): creating a mailing list or a list of participants;
managing a database; accounting records on personnel costs; time-sheets; project planning with
names
Personal data must be processed according to certain principles and conditions that aim to
ensure both data quality and confidentiality35.
The beneficiaries must give their staff access to personal data on a need to know basis, for
carrying out their tasks/functions under the Grant Agreement. This means that the
beneficiaries must put in place adequate access controls and retention policies for the various
categories of data they hold.
The beneficiaries must inform persons (including their staff whose personal data are collected
and processed) about the disclosure of their data to the granting authority by providing them
with the Privacy Statement.
Examples:
1. Before encoding staff data in the Participant Register or into a proposal, the beneficiary must
provide the staff concerned with the privacy statement.
2. If in an ex-post audit, the Granting Authority requests the names, CVs, time-sheets and salaries
of the beneficiary’s staff (to check the eligibility of personnel costs), the beneficiary must inform
the staff concerned and provide them with the privacy statement.
The beneficiaries must ensure for all their data collection and processing a valid legal basis
(see EDPB data protection guide for small business > Process personal data lawfully). Special
attention is required were personal data is transferred to third countries (see EDPB data
protection guide for small business > International data transfers).
Specific cases (data protection):
International organisations (IOs) — The application of the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) is without prejudice to the provisions of international law, such as the
ones governing the privileges and immunities of international organisations (see Articles
10.2). The international organisations are subject to their own data protection internal rules /
regulatory frameworks. At the same time, any controller or processor that falls within the
scope of the GDPR for a given processing activity, and that exchanges personal data with
international organisations, has to comply with the GDPR rules on transfers to international
organisations. Agreements can build on elements already existing in the data protection
internal rules / regulatory framework of the international organisation.

RESULTS — ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE
ARTICLE 16 — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) — BACKGROUND AND
RESULTS —ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE
16.1 Background and access rights to background
The beneficiaries must give each other and the other participants access to the background identified as
needed for implementing the action, subject to any specific rules in Annex 5.
‘Background’ means any data, know-how or information — whatever its form or nature (tangible or
intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that is:
(a) held by the beneficiaries before they acceded to the Agreement and
(b) needed to implement the action or exploit the results.
If background is subject to rights of a third party, the beneficiary concerned must ensure that it is able to
comply with its obligations under the Agreement.
16.2 Ownership of results
The granting authority does not obtain ownership of the results produced under the action.
‘Results’ means any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as data, know-how or information,
whatever its form or nature, whether or not it can be protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including
intellectual property rights.
16.3 Rights of use of the granting authority on materials, documents and information received for
policy, information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes
The granting authority has the right to use non-sensitive information relating to the action and materials and
documents received from the beneficiaries (notably summaries for publication, deliverables, as well as any
other material, such as pictures or audio-visual material, in paper or electronic form) for policy information,
communication, dissemination and publicity purposes — during the action or afterwards.
The right to use the beneficiaries’ materials, documents and information is granted in the form of a royalty-
free, non-exclusive and irrevocable licence, which includes the following rights:
(a) use for its own purposes (in particular, making them available to persons working for the granting
authority or any other EU service (including institutions, bodies, offices, agencies, etc.) or EU
Member State institution or body; copying or reproducing them in whole or in part, in unlimited
numbers; and communication through press information services)
(b) distribution to the public (in particular, publication as hard copies and in electronic or digital
format, publication on the internet, as a downloadable or non-downloadable file, broadcasting by any
channel, public display or presentation, communicating through press information services, or
inclusion in widely accessible databases or indexes)
(c) editing or redrafting (including shortening, summarising, inserting other elements (e.g. meta-data,
legends, other graphic, visual, audio or text elements), extracting parts (e.g. audio or video files),
dividing into parts, use in a compilation)
(d) translation
(e) storage in paper, electronic or other form
(f) archiving, in line with applicable document-management rules
192EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(g) the right to authorise third parties to act on its behalf or sub-license to third parties the modes of use
set out in Points (b), (c), (d) and (f), if needed for the information, communication and publicity
activity of the granting authority and
(h) processing, analysing, aggregating the materials, documents and information received and
producing derivative works.
The rights of use are granted for the whole duration of the industrial or intellectual property rights concerned.
If materials or documents are subject to moral rights or third party rights (including intellectual property
rights or rights of natural persons on their image and voice), the beneficiaries must ensure that they comply
with their obligations under this Agreement (in particular, by obtaining the necessary licences and
authorisations from the rights holders concerned).
Where applicable, the granting authority will insert the following information:
“© – [year] – [name of the copyright owner]. All rights reserved. Licensed to the [name of granting authority] under conditions.”
16.4 Specific rules on IPR, results and background
Specific rules regarding intellectual property rights, results and background (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
16.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such a breach may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Background and access rights to background
In order to ensure a successful project, the participants must give each other mutual access
to background that is necessary for the project implementation (and thus get an overview of
the relevant background and identify if it is needed for the action).
Specific (or different) conditions and additional rules on access to background are
provided for some programmes in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF).
‘Background’ means any tangible or intangible input — from data to know-how, information
or rights — that exists before the grant is signed and that is needed to implement the action
or to exploit its results (e.g. database rights, patents, prototypes, cell lines, etc).
Background is not limited to input owned, but potentially extends to anything the
beneficiaries lawfully hold (e.g. through a licence with the right to sub-licence). If a
beneficiary is a legal person, it also extends to input held by other parts of the beneficiary’s
organisation.
For registered intellectual property rights (‘Intellectual property’ being understood in the
meaning defined in Article 2 of the Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property
Organisation36), it suffices that the application was filed before the grant is signed.
36 Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organisation, signed in Stockholm on 14 July 1967.
Available at http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/convention/trtdocs_wo029.html.
193EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If access to background is subject to restrictions due to the rights of third parties, the
beneficiary should inform the other beneficiaries — before signing the grant — to ensure that
the beneficiaries are still able to comply with their grant obligations.
Example: A beneficiary holding background is by a pre-existing agreement (e.g. licence
agreement) restricted in the access it can grant to such background. The beneficiaries may agree to
exclude the background. Such an exclusion may be temporary (e.g. to permit the adequate
protection of the background before providing access) or limited (e.g. to exclude only one or more
specific beneficiaries). But since background is by definition considered to be needed for the
implementation or exploitation, the impact of such an exclusion on the (especially if not temporary)
should be carefully examined by the beneficiaries.
Best practice: Although not obligatory, beneficiaries are advised to agree in writing on
background before the grant is signed, to ensure that they have access rights to what is
needed for implementing the action, including exploiting its results. The agreement may take
any form (e.g. positive list, negative list). It may be a separate agreement or may be part of
the consortium agreement. If after grant signature beneficiaries come to hold useful inputs
relevant to implement the action, they should endeavour to come to an agreement how such
inputs can be used in the action.
2. Ownership of results
Results belong to the beneficiary(ies) that generated them. The granting authority does not
obtain ownership of the results produced under the action.
‘Results’ include the action’s tangible effects (e.g. data, prototypes, microorganisms),
intangible effects (e.g. know-how, formulas), as well as any attached rights (e.g. patent
rights and database rights). Results do not include the effects generated/produced by
activities outside of the project — be it before the action starts, during its course or after it
ends.
Best practice: To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, beneficiaries should keep documents
such as laboratory notebooks to show how and when they produced the results.
3. Rights of use of the granting authority for communication, dissemination and
publicity purposes
The granting authority may use (free of charge) any non-sensitive information relating to the
action and materials and documents received from the beneficiaries for policy, information,
communication, dissemination and publicity purposes — during the action or afterwards.
Examples (materials): Summaries for publication (submitted as part of the reports), public
deliverables and any other material provided by beneficiaries, such as pictures or audio-visual
material.
Examples (communication activities): Using a picture or the publishable summary included in
the final report submitted by the action to write a story about successful actions for a Commission
publication, or for speeches, etc.
Examples (publicising activities): Providing on a granting authority website information about
the action such as its name, a project summary, the participating partners, the EU funding, etc.
The right to use the beneficiaries’ materials, documents and information is granted in the
form of a royalty-free, non-exclusive and irrevocable licence, for the whole duration of the
industrial or intellectual property rights concerned
Beneficiaries may ask the granting authority to include a copyright notice (e.g. by including
such a notice in the material).
The beneficiaries must ensure that granting authority the can use the documents or materials
by making arrangements with any third parties that could claim rights to them.
If the granting authority needs to edit or redraft the material, it will be careful not to distort
any content.

General > Article 17 — Communication and visibility
ARTICLE 17 — COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY
ARTICLE 17 — COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY
17.1 Communication — Dissemination — Promoting the action
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, the beneficiaries must promote the action and its results
by providing targeted information to multiple audiences (including the media and the public), in accordance
with Annex 1 and in a strategic, coherent and effective manner.
Before engaging in a communication or dissemination activity expected to have a major media impact, the
beneficiaries must inform the granting authority.
17.2 Visibility — European flag and funding statement
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, communication activities of the beneficiaries related to
the action (including media relations, conferences, seminars, information material, such as brochures,
leaflets, posters, presentations, etc., in electronic form, via traditional or social media, etc.), dissemination
activities and any infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, supplies or major result funded by the grant must
acknowledge the EU support and display the European flag (emblem) and funding statement (translated into
local languages, where appropriate):
The emblem must remain distinct and separate and cannot be modified by adding other visual marks, brands
or text.
Apart from the emblem, no other visual identity or logo may be used to highlight the EU support.
When displayed in association with other logos (e.g. of beneficiaries or sponsors), the emblem must be
displayed at least as prominently and visibly as the other logos.
For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the emblem without first
obtaining approval from the granting authority. This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.
Moreover, they may not appropriate the emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration or by
any other means.
196EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
17.3 Quality of information — Disclaimer
Any communication or dissemination activity related to the action must use factually accurate information.
Moreover, it must indicate the following disclaimer (translated into local languages where appropriate):
“Funded by the European Union. Views and opinions expressed are however those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily
reflect those of the European Union or [name of the granting authority]. Neither the European Union nor the granting authority can
be held responsible for them.”
17.4 Specific communication, dissemination and visibility rules
Specific communication, dissemination and visibility rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
17.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Communication, dissemination and promoting the action
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, the beneficiaries must promote the
action through communication and dissemination activities, by providing targeted information
to multiple audiences (including the media and the public), in a strategic and effective
manner and possibly engaging in a two-way exchange.
Security obligations — Respect of other obligations under the Grant Agreement may
limit in some cases the possibility to communicate about the action or disseminate (all of) its
results (e.g. security related obligations such as in case of grants involving classified
information; see Article 13).
The same may also be the case only temporarily, i.e. no communication until other
obligations under the Grant Agreement are fulfilled (e.g. until certain results are protected).
The beneficiaries are in principle free to choose the type of activities, but they should comply
with the principles below and in line with Annex 1.
Examples: A press release at the start of the action; an interview in the local radio station after
a major achievement of the action; organising workshops about the action; an event in a
shopping mall that shows how the outcomes of the action are relevant to our everyday lives;
producing a brochure to explain the action’s work to schools or university students.
The activities must be:
− effective (suited to achieving the action’s communication and dissemination goals) and
be proportionate to the scale of the action (activities carried out by a large-scale
action with beneficiaries coming from several different countries and a large budget
must be more ambitious than smaller actions)
− strategic (ad hoc efforts are NOT sufficient)
− coherent (avoid contradictory messages).
Moreover, the activities must address multiple audiences (beyond the action’s own
community), including the media and the public, in a way that can be understood by non-
specialists. They should highlight the action’s goals, results and include the public policy
perspective sought, e.g. by addressing aspects such as:
197EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− contribution to competitiveness and to solving societal challenges
− impact on everyday lives (e.g. creation of jobs, development of new technologies,
better quality products, more convenience, improved life-style, etc)
− actual or likely exploitation of the results by policy-makers, industry and other
communities
− transnational cooperation in a European consortium (i.e. how working together has
allowed to achieve more than otherwise possible).
The granting authority must be informed beforehand about any activity that is expected to
have a major media impact (media coverage in online and printed press, broadcast media,
social media, etc) that will go beyond having a local impact and which has the potential for
national and international outreach).
For more guidance and communication best practices, see Communicating about your EU-
funded project, EU communication network indicators, and the HE Social Media Guide.
For detailed instructions regarding the use of the European flag (emblem) and funding
statements (including downloadable pictures), see Guidelines on the use of the EU emblem in the
context of EU programmes 2021-2027.
2. Quality of information
Any communication or dissemination activity related to the action must use factually accurate
information. Should it later appear that certain information was not factually accurate (e.g.
new results obtained in a project disprove earlier information given about preliminary
results), the beneficiaries must take any appropriate and immediate steps to correct the
wrong information.
3. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional (or different) rules may be set out in Annex 5.

1. Specific rules for carrying out the action
For all EU programmes, specific rules for carrying out the action are set out in Annex 5.
These rules set out additional obligations that must be respected by the participants when
implementing the action activities. They are usually programme-specific and address
particular policy aspects and situations.
Like all other Annex 5 provisions, they are an integral part of the Grant Agreement and an
essential part of the obligations that must be complied with, in order to properly implement
the action.

ARTICLE 19 — GENERAL INFORMATION OBLIGATIONS
General > Article 19.1 Information requests
19.1 Information requests
ARTICLE 19 — GENERAL INFORMATION OBLIGATIONS
19.1 Information requests
The beneficiaries must provide — during the action or afterwards and in accordance with Article 7 — any
information requested in order to verify eligibility of the costs or contributions declared, proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the other obligations under the Agreement.
The information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
1. Requests for information
In addition to the specific information obligations set out in other parts of the Grant
Agreement (e.g. Articles 20.1, 25.1.2, 25.1.3 and 26.1), the granting authority may request
information from the beneficiaries, to verify that they:
− properly implemented the tasks described in Annex 1
− complied with their obligations under the Grant Agreement.
The granting authority may request any type of information it needs (including personal data
in order to verify that costs declared for specific people are eligible; see Article 15). The level
of detail will depend on the purpose of the request.
It may request the information for any purpose (e.g. checks for monitoring the action or
assessing reports and requests for payment; reviews; audits; investigations; evaluation of
the action’s impact).
The granting authority may request this information at any time, either during the action or
afterwards.
Examples:
1. In an ex-post audit that starts 18 months after the balance is paid, the granting authority may
request any information it needs during the audit procedure (see Article 25).
2. The granting authority may request information from the beneficiaries in order to evaluate the
action’s impact within the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement (see Article
26).
The beneficiary concerned must provide accurate, precise and complete information, in the
format and within the deadline requested.
Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep records and other supporting documents
to prove the proper implementation of the action until the time-limit set out in the Data
Sheet (normally 5 years after final payment; see Article 20.1).
200EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Unless the Grant Agreement specifies direct communication with the other beneficiaries (e.g.
see Articles 7, 21, 25, 26, 39), the granting authority will (usually) contact the coordinator to
provide the information requested. All beneficiaries have to keep their contact information
updated in the Portal also after the end of the action, see Article 19.2.
Example: For audits after the end of the action, the granting authority will normally communicate
directly with the concerned beneficiary/affiliated entity.
All information exchanges should in principle take place through the the Portal, unless the
granting authority explicitly instructs or authorises otherwise (see Article 36).

General > Article 19.2 Participant Register update
19.2 Participant Register data updates
19.2 Participant Register data updates
The beneficiaries must keep — at all times, during the action or afterwards — their information stored in the
Portal Participant Register up to date, in particular, their name, address, legal representatives, legal form and
organisation type.
1. Information in the Participant Register
What? Each beneficiary must keep their information in the Participant Register up-to-date,
including after the end of the grant.
Updated information is required in particular during the time-limit for record-keeping set out
in the Data Sheet, e.g. for the purpose information requests for checks, reviews, audits and
investigation.
The information includes:
− name
− address
− legal representatives
− legal form (e.g. private limited liability company, public law body, S.A., S.L.)
− organisation type (e.g. SME, secondary or higher education establishment, etc.).
How? The information must be updated directly in the Portal Participant Register and will
then be available in the system.However, for important changes impacting the action
implementation, the coordinator should also be informed by the beneficiary (in writing).
More details on participant registration are explained in the Online Manual > Participant
Register.

General > Article 19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
The beneficiaries must immediately inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) of any of the
following:
(a) events which are likely to affect or delay the implementation of the action or affect the EU’s
financial interests, in particular:
(i) changes in their legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation (including
changes linked to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour signed
before grant signature)
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action information: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with linked actions: [OPTION 1 by default: linked action information: not
applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the grant: changes regarding the linked action (see
Article 3)]]
(b) circumstances affecting:
(i) the decision to award the grant or
(ii) compliance with requirements under the Agreement.
19.4 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
What? Each beneficiary must immediately inform about any event that is likely to
(significantly) affect or delay the action’s implementation or affect the EU financial interests.
Such change include in particular (but are not limited to) legal, financial, technical,
organisational or ownership changes and, if required in the Grant Agreement, changes in the
linked actions (if any).
Examples: A beneficiary is under financial stress and chooses to liquidate; a beneficiary is
acquired by or merged with another legal entity; a beneficiary plans to move its facility from a
Member State to a (non-EU) third country; the consortium implementing a linked action dissolves
and no longer cooperates, affecting the implementation of the action as described in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must also inform about any such changes concerning their affiliated entities.
How? The beneficiary concerned should normally inform the coordinator (through their usual
communication channels), who will then inform:
− the granting authority, via the Portal
− the other beneficiaries, through the usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail,
registered letters with proof of delivery, etc).
Best practice: It is recommended that these type of communications are done in writing (not
only orally).
203EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Register update — In many cases, the change may also require an update of the Participant
Register. Consult your LEAR and ask them to make the update.
2. Information about circumstances affecting the decision to award the grant or
compliance with requirements under the GA
What? Beneficiaries that become aware of circumstances (or changes thereof) that could
(potentially) affect the decision to award the grant or compliance with requirements under
the Grant Agreement must disclose them.
Relevant circumstances are those that:
− affect (or could have affected) the decision to award the grant, e.g. if the
information had been known at the time of evaluation it may have led to a different
scoring in the award criteria and may thus have affected the ranking of proposals,
and/or it would have led to rejection (e.g. due to ineligibility)
Example (eligibility): The eligibility criteria of a call require a consortium of three
beneficiaries established in Member States. During the action implementation, one of the
beneficiaries decides to relocate to a third country.
Example (award criteria): A consortium has three beneficiaries. One of them has a
laboratory with specialised equipment and personnel, including a team of internationally
renowned experts in the same field as the project. The quality of the work to be carried out by
this laboratory was taken into account by the evaluators for the scoring of the award criteria,
leading to a higher ranking of the proposal. During the action’s implementation, the beneficiary
sells the laboratory to an external company without involvement in the action, losing an
important part of the relevant expertise.
− affect (or could affect) the fulfilment of obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples (obligations):
1. Due to e.g. a merger, acquisition or contractual changes, certain intellectual property (e.g.
background identified as needed for implementing the action) becomes subject to rights of a
third party which no longer allows the beneficiary to implement the action as described in Annex
1, so the beneficiary can no longer comply with its obligations under the grant.
2. Due to a change of national legislation (e.g. security or export restrictions), the beneficiary
sees itself no longer able to provide deliverables and report on its activities in accordance with
the Grant Agreement.
Even if certain circumstances do not amount to a situation that would potentially affect the
decision to award the grant or compliance with requirements under the Grant Agreement, they may
still have to be notified under point (a) as events which are likely to affect or delay the
implementation of the action or affect the EU financial interests
How? The beneficiary concerned should normally inform the coordinator who will then inform
the granting authority and the other consortium members.
Based on the information, it is then up to the granting authority to assess whether the award
decision or the fulfilment of the obligations are actually affected and whether further
measures are required (incl. measures set out in Chapter 5).
Best practice: In case of doubt, the beneficiary should inform the granting authority (or
coordinator) for clarification.

General > Article 20 — Record-keeping
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
20.1 Keeping records and supporting documents
The beneficiaries must — at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6) — keep records
and other supporting documents to prove the proper implementation of the action in line with the accepted
standards in the respective field (if any).
In addition, the beneficiaries must — for the same period — keep the following to justify the amounts
declared:
(a) for actual costs: adequate records and supporting documents to prove the costs declared (such as
contracts, subcontracts, invoices and accounting records); in addition, the beneficiaries’ usual
accounting and internal control procedures must enable direct reconciliation between the amounts
declared, the amounts recorded in their accounts and the amounts stated in the supporting documents
(b) for flat-rate costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to prove the
eligibility of the costs or contributions to which the flat-rate is applied
(c) for the following simplified costs and contributions: the beneficiaries do not need to keep specific
records on the actual costs incurred, but must keep:
(i) for unit costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to
prove the number of units declared
(ii) for lump sum costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents
to prove proper implementation of the work as described in Annex 1
(iii) for financing not linked to costs (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to
prove the achievement of the results or the fulfilment of the conditions as described in
Annex 1
(d) for unit, flat-rate and lump sum costs and contributions according to usual cost accounting practices
(if any): the beneficiaries must keep any adequate records and supporting documents to prove that
their cost accounting practices have been applied in a consistent manner, based on objective criteria,
regardless of the source of funding, and that they comply with the eligibility conditions set out in
Articles 6.1 and 6.2.
Moreover, the following is needed for specific budget categories:
(e) for personnel costs: time worked for the beneficiary under the action must be supported by
declarations signed monthly by the person and their supervisor, unless another reliable time-record
system is in place; the granting authority may accept alternative evidence supporting the time
worked for the action declared, if it considers that it offers an adequate level of assurance
(f) [OPTION 1 by default: additional record-keeping rules: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes
with additional record-keeping rules: [OPTION 1 by default: additional record-keeping rules: not
applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the call: for [insert name of budget category]: [insert specific
records/requirements]].]
The records and supporting documents must be made available upon request (see Article 19) or in the context
of checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the
Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 25), the beneficiaries must keep these records
and other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.
205EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are considered
originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The granting authority may accept non-
original documents if they offer a comparable level of assurance.
20.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions insufficiently
substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 27), and the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Records and other supporting documentation
The beneficiaries (and their affiliated entities) must keep appropriate and sufficient evidence
to prove the eligibility of all the costs declared, proper implementation of the action and
compliance with all the other obligations under the Grant Agreement. If costs are not
supported by appropriate and sufficient evidence, they will be rejected.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries that do not keep sufficient and appropriate supporting
documents will bear the full risk. The granting authority may take any measures set out in
Chapter 5, including to reject cost or reduce or terminate the grant. Systemic failure to keep
supporting documents may also lead to consequences in other EU actions (extension of audit
findings).
‘Sufficiency’ relates to the quantity of evidence; ‘appropriateness’ relates to its quality.
Evidence is considered sufficient and appropriate if it is persuasive enough to support the
facts or elements that need to be established. In the case of audits, the evidence will be
assessed by the auditors according to generally accepted audit standards.37
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.
Best practice: Where the nature of the action or participants may pose risks or difficulties for
checks, reviews, audits and investigations, the consortium may consider on procedures to
facilitate access to records, e.g. by depositing also adequate records with the coordinator, in
order to minimise the risk for cost rejections by the granting authority due to lack of access
to supporting documents.
The evidence must be correctly archived for the duration indicated in the Grant Agreement
(see Data Sheet, Point 6). In general, for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (3 years
for low-value grants up to EUR 60 000) or longer if there are ongoing procedures (audits,
investigations, litigation, etc). In this case, the evidence must be kept until ongoing
procedures end.
The rules in the Grant Agreement determine obligations under the EU action and do NOT
absolve the beneficiary from compliance with obligations under national law, e.g. national laws
requiring a longer retention period for keeping documents (or other additional measures).

In principle, the beneficiaries must keep original documents (i.e. documents considered as
original under national law) in the format in which they were received or created. This means
that:
− documents received or created in paper form should be kept in paper form
− documents received or created electronically should be kept in their electronic format
(hard copies of original electronic documents are NOT required).
Examples:
1. We will accept authenticated copies or digitally-signed documents, if national law accepts these
as originals.
2. We will accept digitalised copies of documents (instead of hard copies), if this is acceptable under
national law.
Exceptionally, the granting authority may accept non-original documents if they offer a
comparable level of assurance but this assessment is entirely up to the granting authority
and any beneficiary not keeping an original bears the full risk of cost rejection or grant
reduction.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should apply a consistent record-keeping policy, i.e. avoid that
non-original documents are presented only for the EU action whereas original records are
kept for other activities.
3. Records for actual costs
For actual costs, the beneficiaries must:
− keep detailed records and other supporting documents to prove the eligibility of the
costs declared
− use cost accounting practices and internal control procedures that make it possible to
verify that the amounts declared, amounts recorded in the accounts and amounts
recorded in supporting documentation match up.
The information included in the financial statements for each budget category (i.e. personnel
costs, subcontracting costs, etc) must be broken down into details and must match the
amounts recorded in the accounts and in supporting documentation.
Examples:
1. For costs declared in category A.1 Employees (or equivalent): the costs must be detailed for
each person carrying out work for the action (individual daily rate multiplied by day-equivalents
worked for the action). They must match the accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions,
annual financial statements) and supporting documentation (i.e. labour contracts, collective labour
agreements, applicable national law on taxes, labour and social security contributions, payslips,
time records, bank statements showing salary payments, etc).
2. For costs declared in category C. Purchase costs: the beneficiary must keep a breakdown of
costs declared by type (i.e. equipment cost, costs of other goods, works and services, etc). It
should be able to provide details of individual transactions for each type of cost. For depreciation, it
must be able to provide details per individual equipment used for the action. Declared costs must
match accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions, annual financial statements) and
supporting documentation (i.e. purchase orders, delivery notes, invoices, contracts, bank
statements, asset usage logbook, depreciation policy, etc).
4. Records for simplified cost and contributions, and financing not linked to cost
In contrast to actual cost, for simplified cost options (units, lump sums, flat-rates) and
financing not linked to cost, keeping of financial records on the actual cost incurred during
the action is NOT required.
207EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This does NOT however release the beneficiary from record-keeping rules under
applicable national law. The simplification relates to the EU grant-specific record-keeping
and reporting obligations.
Any financial and accounting records will not be assessed unless it is necessary for the
assessment of the implementation of the units, lump sums etc. declared, or to assess the
correctness of the methodology for beneficiaries using their usual cost accounting practices
(see below), or to assess the correctness of information provided in the proposal on which
basis a simplified cost amount was established.
− flat-rate costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and
other supporting documents to prove that the costs to which the flat-rate is applied
are eligible.
Example: For the flat-rate of indirect costs, the auditors will verify (and the beneficiaries must
be able to show) that the actual direct costs to which the flat-rate is applied are eligible.
− unit costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and other
supporting documents to prove the number of units declared.
− lump sum costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the completion of the action tasks, the achievement of
results, or the fulfilment of the conditions as described in Annex 1.
− financing not linked to costs: the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the achievement of the results or the fulfilment of the
conditions as described in Annex 1.
5. Records for unit, flat-rate, lump sum costs and contributions calculated in
accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices
For unit, flat-rate, lump sum costs and contributions declared in accordance with usual cost
accounting practices, the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and other supporting
documents to:
− show that the method used is their usual cost accounting practice (i.e. not just used
for the EU grant)
− show that the method used for the initial calculation of the unit, flat-rate, or lump sum
appropriately reflects the actual costs as recorded in the statutory accounts
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): accounting records;
financial statement extracts; labour contracts; collective labour agreements; applicable tax,
labour and social security laws; pay slips; bank statements showing salary payments;
classification of employees (based on experience, qualifications, salary, department, etc).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): accounting records; financial
statement extracts; time records (or other records) for the share of personnel costs included in
the unit costs; invoices or contracts for maintenance costs, cleaning costs, other services, etc,
showing how the actual costs are directly or indirectly included in the unit cost calculation.
Manual interventions into the accounting data (if any) must be traceable and
documented.
− verify that the unit, flat-rate, lump sum are free of ineligible cost components
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): records that show that the
daily rate does not include an indirect cost component (they should be covered by the indirect
208EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
costs category); records that show that the daily rate does not include travel costs (they should
be claimed under category C.1 Travel and subsistence).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): evidence that shows that there is
no profit/margin/mark-up included in the internally invoiced goods and services (e.g. different
rates: one for billing the activity, with mark-up, and another one for internal costing, free of any
mark-up); lists of accounts/cost centres that were excluded from the calculation of internally
invoiced goods and services — because already included in the costs claimed under another
budget categories (e.g. under personnel costs)
− assess the acceptability of budgeted and estimated elements.
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): records that show the
method for calculating the annual salary increases (e.g. consumer price index which, according
to the beneficiary’s usual remuneration policy, serves as the basis for annual salary increases).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): traceable data used to determine
the budgeted/ estimated elements; records on the nature and frequency of the updates of the
budgeted and estimated elements; etc.
It is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred during the action (per
person/good or service) — unless they are needed to document the usual cost accounting
practices.
6. Records for personnel costs — Day-equivalents worked for the action
For persons who work for the action (regardless if they are full-time or part-time employees
and/or if they work exclusively or not for the action; new for 2021-2027), the beneficiaries
may either:
− by default, sign a monthly declaration on day-equivalents worked for the action
(template)
OR
− use another paper- or computer-based reliable time recording system, to record (at
least) all the time (days/hours) worked for the action.
Best practice: It is recommended to explore the simplification potential of using monthly
declarations on days worked for the action. This limits record-keeping burden and avoids the
need for conversion of hours into day-equivalents.
Reliable time records must be dated and signed at least monthly by the person working for
the action and their supervisor.
NO rounding (up or down to the nearest half day-equivalent) for the time recording in
the monthly declarations. The rounding rule applies ONLY for the cost calculation (i.e. the
number of day-equivalents to declare and the maximum declarable day-equivalents) and for
the conversion from the total hours worked on the action into day-equivalents (in case of
time-recording systems based on hours). By contrast, it is NOT allowed to round up or down
to the nearest half day-equivalent in the monthly declaration.
Example: If a person with a standard working day of 8 hours worked 2 hours on the action during a
given month, 0,25 day-equivalents should be recorded for that month in their monthly declaration.
If the time recording system is computer-based, the signatures may be electronic (i.e. linking
the electronic identity data, e.g. a password and user name, to the electronic validation
data), with a documented and secure process for managing user rights and an auditable log
of all electronic transactions.
209EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Conversion of hours into day-equivalents: If you do not use the monthly declaration of
days, and instead record the time worked in hours, you must convert the total hours worked
into day-equivalents to calculate the personnel costs for the grant (see Article 6.2.A.1).
To convert hours into day-equivalents:
{number of hours worked by the person on the action during the reporting period
divided by
(number of hours of a day-equivalent)}
The resulting figure must be rounded up or down to the nearest half-day (e.g. 17,79 = 18
day-equivalents; 17,64 = 17,5 day-equivalents).
You have three options to determine the number of hours of a day-equivalent:
− Option 1: a day-equivalent is 8 hours
− Option 2: average working hours as per contract (or another binding document, e.g.
collective labour agreement, national labour legislation). You can NOT use this option
if the contract (or other binding document) does not allow to determine the average
number of hours that the person must work per day. By contrast, fluctuating or
variable working hours during the year are not a problem (see specific cases below).
− 2a: If the number of working hours is specified per day:
{working hours per day divided by working time factor}
Examples:
Full-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person is employed
full-time and must work 7,8 hours each working day. A day-equivalent for the
person is 7,8 hours (7,8 / 1 [working time factor]).
Part-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person is employed
50 % part-time and must work 4 hours each working day. A day-equivalent for the
person is 8 hours (4 / 0.5 [working time factor]).
− 2b: If the number of working hours is specified per week or month:
{(working hours per week [or month] divided by working time factor) divided by
working days per week [or month]}
For the calculation above, the number of ‘working days’ per week (or
month) is not the actual days worked by the person, but the standard number
of working days per week (or month) as per the beneficiary’s usual practices
(and applicable rules/laws). This is usually 5 working days per week (e.g.
Monday to Friday). The number should be the same for full-time and part-time
employees irrespective of the actual distribution of the (full or part-time)
working time over the week (or month).
Examples:
Full-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person must work
37,5 hours per week over 5 working days. A day-equivalent for the person is ((37,5
/ 1 [working time factor]) / 5 [days]) = 7,5 hours.
Part-time case (hours per week): The person is employed 50 % part-time and
the contract establishes that the person must work 18,75 hours per week
(consisting of five working days as per the beneficiary’s practice). In practice, the
person works two full days and a half each week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
morning). The number of working days to be used in the formula is 5 (NOT 2,5 or 3
actual days worked). A day-equivalent for the person is ((18.75 / 0.5 [working time
factor]) / 5 [days]) = 7,5 hours.
210EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Part-time case (hours per month): The person is employed 50 % part-time and
the contract establishes that the person must work 80 hours per month over 22
working days. A day-equivalent for the person is ((80 / 0,5 [working time factor]) /
22 [days]) = 7,3 hours.
− 2c: If the number of working hours is specified per year:
{(working hours per year divided by working time factor) divided by 215}
Example: If the collective labour agreement sets out 1612 hours of work per year
for full-time employees, the hours for the calculation must be adapted to 806 (1612
x 0,5) working hours per year for a 50% part-time employee, i.e. 806 / 0,5 / 215 =
7.5h day-equivalent.
− Option 3: If you have a usual cost accounting practice determining the standard
number of annual productive hours of a full-time employee, you may determine the
value of a day-equivalent as follows:
{(the higher between the standard number of annual productive hours of a full-time
employee and 90 % of the standard annual workable hours of a full-time employee)
divided by
215}
The chosen option must be applied consistently, i.e. using the same option at least
per group of personnel employed under similar conditions (e.g. same type of contract,
same cost-centre). You cannot apply the most favourable option for each employee
individually.
A conversion normally needs to be done only once per person per reporting period
for the purpose of reporting to the granting authority. It is not required that you keep a
parallel record system that directly converts hours into day-equivalents.
If you keep parallel time record systems, e.g. weekly time-sheets of hours and
monthly declarations of days, they must be consistent. In case of significant
discrepancies discovered e.g. during checks, reviews and audits, only the set of documents
recording the lower amount of days will be accepted.
Specific cases (conversion into day-equivalents):
Change of working hours during a reporting period — Option 2 (average working hours
as per contract) can also be used in case of work pattern changes (for instance, in case of an
amendment to the internal regulations and/or national (labour) law of the beneficiary
concerning daily working hours within the reporting period). In this case, the conversion from
hours to day equivalents must be done separately; in practice, you should perform a
separate conversion calculation for each period during which a different work pattern regime
was in effect. Then, sum the results to determine the total number of hours converted into
day-equivalents
Example: The beneficiary has decided to modify the working hours schedule effective from
01/01/2025, reducing the work day from 8 hours to 7 hours. The reporting period for the action is
from 01/01/2024 to 30/06/2025. The daily rate for each individual employee should be calculated
based on the hours worked (converted into day equivalents) during 2024 and 2025. The conversion
from hours to day equivalents should be calculated as follows:
A full-time employee of the beneficiary has recorded 800 hours in the year 2024 and 280 hours in
2025 for work on this project. To calculate the day equivalents worked for the action:
(800 hours worked in 2024 divided by the 8-hour day equivalent in 2024) plus (280 hours worked
in 2025 divided by the 7-hour day equivalent in 2025) equals 100 + 40, which totals 140 day
equivalents worked for the action.
Changes of working hours during different periods of each year (annual seasonal
fluctuation in working hours) — When the number of working hours fluctuates over the
211EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
year (e.g. 8 hours per day for all months except 7 hours per day during July and August), the
following formula must be applied:
{[(working hours per day multiplied by the number of months to which it applies) plus (working
hours per day multiplied by the number of months to which it applies)] divided by 12. The result
should then be divided by working time factor}
7. Records of affiliated entities, associated partners and other participants
In principle, each participant keeps their own records (to prove costs or proper
implementation; new for 2021-2027). In case of a check, review, audit or investigation, the
granting authority may ask the coordinator or responsible beneficiary to provide the
necessary documents.

General > Article 21 — Reporting
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
General > Article 21.1 Continuous reporting
21.1 Continuous reporting
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
21.1 Continuous reporting
The beneficiaries must report on the progress of the action (e.g. deliverables, milestones,
outputs/outcomes, critical risks, indicators, etc; if any), in the Portal Continuous Reporting tool and in
accordance with the timing and conditions it sets out (as agreed with the granting authority).
Standardised deliverables (e.g. progress reports not linked to payments, reports on cumulative expenditure,
special reports, etc; if any) must be submitted using the templates published on the Portal.
1. Continuous reporting
What? The beneficiaries must provide regular updates on the status of the action
implementation. This is the continuous reporting.
The continuous reporting may cover (non-exhaustive list):
− progress in achieving milestones, which are control points in the action that help to
chart progress (kick-off meetings, steering committees, first-draft of a survey,
prototype, etc); they may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, which
allows the next phase of the work to begin or is needed at intermediary points
− deliverables, which are additional outputs that must be produced at a given moment
during the action and submitted to the granting authority
Examples: Information, special report, a technical diagram brochure, list, a software milestone
or other building block of the action.
− response to critical risks, which are a plausible event or issue that could have a high
adverse impact on the ability of the action to achieve its objectives
− programme-specific monitoring information or indicators like those related to
publications, communications activities, IPRs, Open Data, Trainings, Gender etc. (if
required for your programme and depending on the type of action).
How & When? The deliverables (including progress reports not linked to payments, if any)
must be submitted through the Portal Continuous Reporting tool, in accordance with the
schedule set out for them. Both the schedule and templates to be used (if any) are available
through the Deliverables screen.
213EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 21.2 Periodic reporting
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
In addition, the beneficiaries must provide reports to request payments, in accordance with the schedule and
modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2):
- for additional pre-financings (if any): an additional pre-financing report
- for interim payments (if any) and the final payment: a periodic report.
The pre-financing and periodic reports include a technical and financial part.
The technical part includes an overview of the action implementation. It must be prepared using the template
available in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool.
The financial part of the additional pre-financing report includes a statement on the use of the previous pre-
financing payment.
The financial part of the periodic report includes:
− the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all beneficiaries/affiliated entities)
− the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
− the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point
4.3).
The financial statements must detail the eligible costs and contributions for each budget category and, for
the final payment, also the revenues for the action (see Articles 6 and 22).
All eligible costs and contributions incurred should be declared, even if they exceed the amounts indicated in
the estimated budget (see Annex 2). Amounts that are not declared in the individual financial statements will
not be taken into account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statements (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the beneficiaries confirm
that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the costs and contributions declared are eligible (see Article 6)
- the costs and contributions can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting documents (see
Article 20) that will be produced upon request (see Article 19) or in the context of checks, reviews,
audits and investigations (see Article 25)
- for the final periodic report: all the revenues have been declared (if required; see Article 22).
Beneficiaries will have to submit also the financial statements of their affiliated entities (if any). In case of
recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the financial statements of their
affiliated entities.
1. Periodic reporting
What? In addition to the continuous reporting and in order to receive payments (any type;
additional pre-financings, interim and final payment), the beneficiaries (and their affiliated
entities) must submit reports for payment to document the technical (and financial)
implementation of the action. This is the periodic reporting.
214EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
These reports must be distinguished from deliverables and milestones (that are part of
Annex 1; see Article 21.1).
How & When? The reports for payment must be submitted through the Portal Periodic
Reporting tool after the end of each reporting period (including the final one; for the
schedule, see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
The coordinator must submit either an additional pre-financing report (for additional pre-
financing payment) or a periodic report (for interim and final payment).
In both cases, this report is composed of two main parts, a technical and a financial part.
The technical part aims at providing an overview of the action implementation and progress
and its content is programme-specific. It usually includes an explanation of work carried out,
overview of progress, publishable summary, key performance indicators, etc (template
available for download directly in the system)
The financial part is filled in directly online and includes:
− for additional pre-financing:
− a statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment (only supporting
document; no other financial information to be filled in)
− for interim and final payments:
− the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all
beneficiaries/affiliated entities
− the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if
required)
− the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2
and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) (template available for download directly in the
system).
The explanation of the use of resources must be consistent with the costs declared
in the financial statement (for each beneficiary/affiliated entity).
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries must keep adequate records of the documents
submitted for their affiliated entities (e.g. financial statement, CFS, etc; see Article 20).
For additional pre-financings, the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing
serves to curb the paying out of additional pre-financing, if not really needed (— either
because progress of the action is slow or the consumption of the previous pre-financing is
low). The additional pre-financing payment will be reduced, if — according to this statement
— the previous pre-financing was not fully used (see Article 22.3.1). Thus:
− if 70% or more of the previous pre-financing has been used: the additional pre-
financing is paid in full
− if less than 70% of the previous pre-financing has been used: the additional pre-
financing will be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the
percentage actually used and 70%.
For interim or final payments, each beneficiary/affiliated entity must fill out their individual
financial statement (individually), and then signed and formally submitted to the coordinator
(for beneficiaries, directly in the Portal; for affiliated entities, through their beneficiary). This
includes the coordinator, who must also submit the individual financial statement for itself.
215EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The individual financial statements (Annex 4 of the Grant Agreement) must contain all costs
that:
− were incurred by the beneficiary/affiliated entities during the reporting period and
− fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.
Best practice: Beneficiaries/affiliated entities should declare ALL their eligible costs — even if
they are above the estimated budget in Annex 2 (cost overruns). The grant will be capped at
the maximum grant amount in Annex 2, but cost overruns may turn out useful, if the
granting authority should reject some of the costs (at payment or later on).
Beneficiaries/affiliated entities may declare costs incurred during a previous reporting period,
if they were not declared before.
By contrast, once costs have been declared (closed financial statement), they should
normally no longer be changed. If a beneficiary/affiliated entity notices a mistake in a
previous financial statement (e.g. incorrect accounting information; error in the calculation;
etc), they can however make an adjustment (positive or negative) at the next reporting.
Such adjustments can be made to the financial statements for any previous reporting period.
Example: An internal audit by the beneficiary on the annual accounts finds errors in the
accounting information used to calculate the daily rate. The beneficiary can adapt the costs
declared to the EU action at the next reporting.
For affiliated entities, the financial statements must be filled out and submitted by their
beneficiary (since the affiliated entities cannot sign them in the IT system). Before
submission, the beneficiary must complete the data for the affiliated entity (based on the
information it received from the affiliated entity). The affiliated entity must ensure the
accuracy of the encoded information, but the beneficiary is ultimately responsible for
submitting the statement (see Article 21.2).
Best practice: Beneficiaries and their affiliated entities may establish practical information
exchange procedures to ensure and verify the accuracy of the financial statement data to be
submitted. For example, the beneficiary can create a PDF export from the system and send
it to the affiliated entity for confirmation.

General > Article 21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
The financial statements must be drafted in euro.
[OPTION 1 for programmes with double conversion (standard):
Beneficiaries with general accounts established in a currency other than the euro must convert the costs
recorded in their accounts into euro, at the average of the daily exchange rates published in the C series of the
Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website), calculated over the corresponding reporting period.
If no daily euro exchange rate is published in the Official Journal for the currency in question, they must be
converted at the average of the monthly accounting exchange rates published on the European Commission
website (InforEuro), calculated over the corresponding reporting period.
Beneficiaries with general accounts in euro must convert costs incurred in another currency into euro
according to their usual accounting practices.]
[OPTION 6 for programmes with double conversion (EU or Oanda) with average/monthly/daily conversion
rates:
Beneficiaries with general accounts established in a currency other than the euro must convert the costs
recorded in their accounts into euro:
- either at the end of the corresponding reporting period:
- using the average of the daily exchange rates published either by the EU in the C series of
the Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website) or by Oanda over the
corresponding reporting period or
- if no daily euro exchange rate is published for the currency in question, using the average of
the monthly accounting exchange rates published on the European Commission website
(InforEuro) over the corresponding reporting period
- or for each month separately over the corresponding reporting period:
- using the monthly accounting exchange rate published, for that month, on the European
Commission website (InforEuro)
- or for each day separately over the corresponding reporting period:
- using the accounting exchange rate published, for that day, either by the EU in the C series
of the Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website) or by Oanda.
Beneficiaries with general accounts in euro must convert costs incurred in another currency into euro
according to their usual accounting practices.]
1. Currency for financial statements and conversion into euro
Beneficiaries/affiliated entities must report their costs in the financial statements in euros.
The rules on conversion (of costs incurred in other currencies into euros) are as follows:
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities with accounting records in euros: conversion of
costs according to their usual accounting practices
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities with accounting records in a currency other than the
euro, the rules on conversion of costs recorded in their accounts may be one of the
following:
217EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for programmes with double conversion rule (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2; currently
all programmes):
− using the average, over the corresponding reporting period, of the daily
exchange rates published (most programmes):
− in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union
To calculate this average rate based on the daily exchange rates
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union,
the beneficiaries may use the editable charts on the ECB website.
How to calculate the rate on the ECB website:
Step 1 — Go to the ECB website.
Step 2 — Click on the chart icon [ ] for the currency.
Step 3 — Select the conversion (normally other currency vs. Euro).
Step 4 — Insert the starting date of the reporting period in the field
‘from’ and the end date of the reporting period in the field ‘to’. The
average for the period will appear above the chart.
Note that the ECB has changed their methodology for the displayed
average currency exchange rates (over any given period). Therefore,
average currency conversion rates taken from the ECB website before 13
April 2023 may not correspond to the average for the same period
displayed since April 13. Financial statements based on currency
conversions done with the ECB calculator before 13 April 2023 remain
however fully valid and will be recognised in case of checks, audits,
reviews or investigations. You do not need to make any

corresponding reporting period, using the currency converter on the
Commission website (InforEur).
− using either an average, monthly or daily rate (RELEX):
− for the average rate: calculation using the average over the reporting
period, in accordance with the same rules as above (plus possibility to
use the exchange rate published by Oanda instead of the rate published
by the EU)
− for the monthly rate: calculation for each month separately over the
reporting period, using the monthly accounting exchange rate published,
for each month, on the European Commission website (InforEuro)
− for the daily rate: calculation for each day separately over the reporting
period, using the accounting exchange rate published, for each day
either by the EU on the ECB website or by Oanda.
For cost adjustments to previous periods (‘adjustment financial statements’), the exchange
rate to be used is the one for the reporting period in which the costs adjusted were incurred.
For partial reporting periods (e.g. because a beneficiary joins the grant in the middle of a
reporting period), the exchange rate should be calculated as from the start date of joining the
grant.For eligible costs related to drafting and submitting the final reports incurred after the
action duration, the exchange rate to be used is the one for the last reporting period.

21.4 Reporting language
21.4 Reporting language
The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority
(see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
21.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a report submitted does not comply with this Article, the granting authority may suspend the payment
deadline (see Article 29) and apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the grant or the
coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Language of reports
For most programmes, the reports must be drafted in the language of the Grant
Agreement (indicated at the end of the Grant Agreement, next to the signatures of the
parties), unless the granting authority agreed differently.
For RELEX, the Data Sheet option in the Grant Agreement refers to the language(s) specified
in the call document (and this special language regime is then valid also for project reviews
and audits; see Article 25).

22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) and must be
distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to distribution of the initial pre-financing payment;
see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date when they are debited
to its account.
1. Payments to be made
The granting authority will make payments in accordance with what is set out in the Data
Sheet. This may include the following:
− pre-financing payment(s) at the beginning of the action (to provide beneficiaries
with a cash float to start working on the project).
Pre-financing will NOT be paid before the Grant Agreement is signed (even if the
starting date of the action is before).
− interim payment(s) to cover eligible costs incurred in the reporting periods (as
many interim payments as number of reporting periods, minus one which is the final
payment)
− the final payment (payment of the balance) after the end of the action.
All payments are subject to a payment deadline (i.e. number of days within which the
granting authority has to pay the consortium — after having received the payment request).
The deadline is defined in the Data Sheet.
If there are issues with the payment request or with the costs declared which make it
impossible to continue with the payment, the granting authority will suspend the deadline
(see Article 29). The granting authority can also, in specific circumstances, suspend
payments (see Article 30).
220EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
All payments (pre-financings, interim payments and final payment) may be offset against
debts of any of the beneficiaries towards the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary based on its eligible cost and contributions. If the granting authority is the
Commission or an EU executive agency, the offsetting will also be done for debts towards other
Commission services or executive agencies. This offsetting will be done automatically and is not
subject to the consent of the beneficiary concerned.
Note that in case of early termination of the action, the coordinator should normally not
become responsible for paying back amounts of prefinancing that were never received because
they were offset for the debts of another partner. If this happens, the granting authority may
agree to deviate from the Grant Agreement provisions and re-instate the recovery order towards
the initial debtor. Please contact the EU project officer in charge of your grant.
The payments are made to the coordinator’s bank account as set out in the Grant
Agreement; the beneficiaries are NOT paid individually by the granting authority.
The coordinator must distribute the amounts received to the beneficiaries. However, how and
when the payments are distributed is in principle an internal matter for the consortium.
The consortium agreement (if applicable) may set out, for instance, specific periods
for the distribution of payments or that the distribution will be carried out in
instalments (and these will not be considered ‘unjustified delays’, if the arrangements
set out in the consortium agreement are complied with).
Similarly, the consortium agreement may provide for a distribution of the funding
which is different from the contribution approved by the granting authority for each
beneficiary.
If the coordinator does NOT comply with its payment distribution obligations, this is in
principle an issue to be resolved within the consortium. However, persistent failure to
comply with obligations of the coordinator (such as distribution of payments) may lead
to any of the consequences as provided under the respective measure in Chapter 5.
The granting authority will normally not be informed of the distribution of the payments by
the coordinator, unless:
− if it specifically requests this
− in the event of recovery at the payment of the balance (see Article 22.3.4)
− if the participation of one or more beneficiary is terminated (see Article 22.3.2).

General > Article 22.2 Recoveries
22.2 Recoveries
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it turns out that the
granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts undue.
[OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: The general liability regime for
recoveries (first-line liability) is as follows: At final payment, the coordinator will be fully liable for
recoveries, even if it has not been the final recipient of the undue amounts. At beneficiary termination or after
final payment, recoveries will be made directly against the beneficiaries concerned.
Beneficiaries will be fully liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4):
- the beneficiaries will be jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of another beneficiary under
the Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority (see Data
Sheet, Point 4.4)
- affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of their beneficiaries under the Agreement
(including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
[OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: Each beneficiary’s financial
responsibility in case of recovery is in principle limited to their own debt and undue amounts of their
affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4), affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of
their beneficiaries, if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
1. Recoveries of undue amounts
If it turns out that the granting authority has paid too much — for example due to cost
rejection or grant reduction (in particular, following a check, audit, extension of audit
findings, review or OLAF investigation), it will recover the amount paid in excess.
Recovery normally takes place only at payment of the balance or afterwards. Exceptionally, it
can take place before, if a beneficiary’s participation is terminated.
The detailed calculations for all cases are described in Article 22.3.
2. Financial liability for recoveries
The financial liability for recoveries depends on the programme:
− for programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): the financial liability is as
follows:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation, but not intervene to recover this money (no debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole
amount that needs to be recovered (i.e. paid back to the granting authority)—
even if it has not been the final recipient of the concerned amount (debit note);
if the coordinator does not pay (irrespective of the reason), the granting
authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, drawing on the pre-
222EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
financing guarantee, joint and several liability of other beneficiaries or affiliated
entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see Article 22.4)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): each beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle
limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by their affiliated
entities. It is only for the contribution to the MIM that financial responsibility is
shared:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation and, if the beneficiary doesn’t pay, the granting authority may call
on the MIM to intervene and then start a recovery procedure against the
beneficiary for the account of the MIM (debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the contribution to the MIM will be used to
cover recoveries (if any); if the contribution is not sufficient, the coordinator
will be asked to pay back the amount owed (as representative of the
consortium); if the debt is not paid but the report on the distribution of
payments was provided, the granting authority will calculate the share of the
debt per beneficiary and confirm the amount to be recovered from each of
them separately (debit note); if they do not pay (irrespective of the reason),
the granting authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, joint and
several liability of affiliated entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see
Article 22.4); if the report on the distribution of payments was NOT provided,
the granting authority will enforce recovery against the coordinator (debit
note); if needed, the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and
will then continue recovery for the account of the MIM (second debit note
replacing the first)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note); no MIM intervention (new for 2021-
2027).
In addition, beneficiaries are always liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities
AND there may be specific joint and several liability regimes in case of enforced recoveries
(depending on the type of programme and Grant Agreement; see Article 22.4).
2.1Programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries, the granting authority will
recover the undue amounts:
from the coordinator if the recovery is at the final payment
from the beneficiary who owes the money (including undue amounts paid for costs declared
by its affiliated entities, if any) if the recovery is at beneficiary termination or after the final
payment.
In case of enforced recovery, i.e. when the coordinator/beneficiary does not pay the amount
owed, if the corresponding option has been activated (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4), the
granting authority may hold the beneficiaries jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of
another beneficiary under the Agreement (including late-payment interest)
recover also from the affiliated entities. The affiliated entity’s financial responsibility (for the
debt towards the granting authority) is limited to its maximum grant amount in Annex 2.For
more information on enforced recoveries see Article 22.4.
2.2. Programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries he granting authority will
recover the undue amounts from the beneficiary that owes the money (including undue
amounts paid for costs declared by its affiliated entities, if any).
223EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In case of recovery, each beneficiary’s financial responsibility is normally limited to its own
debt (which includes undue amounts paid for costs declared by its affiliated entities, if any).
If the granting authority has requested joint and several liability of an affiliated entity, it may
recover also from the affiliated entity in case of enforced recovery. The affiliated entity’s
financial responsibility (for the debt towards the granting authority) is limited to its maximum
grant amount in Annex 2.
For more information on enforced recoveries see Article 22.4.
3. Procedure
The basic procedure for recovery is almost always the same: After a contradictory
procedure, the granting authority claims repayment of the amounts and, if not paid, then
enforces recovery (see Article 22.4).
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention to recover (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms the amount to be recovered, and issues a debit note.
Specific cases:
Recoveries for beneficiary in insolvency/bankruptcy — If a beneficiary is in
insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings, the granting authority may have to act quickly in order
to submit its claims in accordance with the deadlines under the national
insolvency/bankruptcy procedures. If immediate action is needed, it will make a provisional
declaration and then complete the contradictory procedure with the beneficiary (and, if
needed, adjust or cancel the provisional declaration).

22.3.1 Pre-financing payments
22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Pre-financing payments
The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial pre-financings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2).
For additional pre-financings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment shows that
less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the
70% threshold and the amount used.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The contribution to the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism will be retained from the pre-financing payments (at the rate and in accordance with
the modalities set out in the Data Sheet, see Point 4.2) and transferred to the Mechanism.]
Pre-financing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts
owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
1. Pre-financing payments
Most programmes foresee the payment of pre-financing, in order to give beneficiaries a
sufficient float to start working on the action.
All pre-financing funds remain EU property until they are cleared against eligible
costs or contributions accepted by the granting authority (normally at final payment). The
pre-financing is therefore an advance payment. It will only become the property of the
beneficiaries when the granting authority approves the corresponding EU funding based on
eligible costs or contributions.
If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the initial pre-financing payment is
automatically paid after grant signature. The consortium does NOT need to submit a request
of payment to get it.
For additional pre-financings (if any), the consortium will be prompted to submit an
additional pre-financing report (which includes a statement on the use of the previous pre-
financing payment; see Article 21.2).
The ‘use’ of pre-financing does not necessarily correspond to incurring actual cost. Pre-
financing can be considered already used if in accordance with the usual accounting practice
of the beneficiary a corresponding amount has been committed (e.g. on subcontracts or
financial support to third parties (FSTP)) for the implementation of the action and cannot be
used for other commitments anymore.
225EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The additional pre-financing payment will be reduced if — according to the statement on use
of the previous pre-financing payment — less than 70% of the previous pre-financing was
used. In that case, the amount of the additional pre-financing set out in the Data Sheet will
be reduced by the difference between 70% of the previous pre-financing and the amount
actually used.
Example: The Data Sheet indicates that there will be an initial pre-financing of EUR 100 000
and one additional pre-financing of EUR 50 000. The consortium reports in the statement of the
use of previous pre-financing payment that only EUR 65 000 have been used so far. The
additional pre-financing payment will be:
{50 000 – ((100 000 x 0.7) – 65 000)} = 45 000
Pre-financing amount:
The amount of the initial and additional pre-financings (if any) are fixed by the granting
authority before grant signature (calculation usually based on a percentage of the maximum
grant amount in Annex 2). It will be lowered for additional pre-financings if the beneficiaries
used less than 70% of the previous pre-financing. The granting authority will inform the
coordinator about the amount paid in the pre-financing payment letter.
Specific cases (pre-financing payments):
Contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM) (HE only) — For programmes
with MIM, the contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism will be automatically deducted
from the initial pre-financing payment and transferred to the MIM (and then released at the
end of the action; see the specific cases on final payment in Article 22.3.4).
Example: For a grant with a maximum amount of EUR 1 000 000 and a 40% pre-financing rate,
EUR 50 000 (5% of the maximum grant amount) will be retained from the EUR 400 000 pre-
financing, resulting in a payment of EUR 350 000 to the coordinator.
Financial support to third parties (FSTP) — Where an action includes financial support to
third parties (e.g. in the form of grants), the commitments entered into by the beneficiaries
vis-à-vis their third parties receiving financial support can be included in the ‘additional pre-
financing report’ for the purpose of calculating the 70% usage threshold, even if no payments
have been made — provided it is the usual accounting practice of the beneficiaries to
consider the corresponding amounts as committed/used and thus no longer available for
other purposes.

General > Article 22.3.2 Beneficiary termination
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
In case of beneficiary termination, the granting authority will determine the provisional amount due for the
beneficiary concerned. Payments (if any) will be made with the next interim or final payment.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary for all reporting
periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the accepted
costs of the beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold
cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum
contributions and financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting amount is the
‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the distribution of
payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments received (if any)}.
If the balance is positive, the amount will be included in the next interim or final payment to the consortium.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be recovered and the
reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the
observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this amount to be paid to the
coordinator (confirmation letter).
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If payment is not made to the
coordinator by the date specified in the confirmation letter, the granting authority may call on the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism to intervene, if continuation of the action is guaranteed and the conditions set out in
the rules governing the Mechanism are met.
In this case, it will send a beneficiary recovery letter, together with a debit note with the terms and date for
payment.
The debit note for the beneficiary will include the amount calculated for the affiliated entities which also had
to end their participation (if any).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.]
The amounts will later on also be taken into account for the next interim or final payment.
227EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recoveries?
If a beneficiary is terminated and leaves the consortium, the granting authority must
provisionally close the accounts for that beneficiary.
The amount due at beneficiary termination will be calculated on the basis of the termination
report, the EU contribution already approved and the report on the distribution of payments
(see also Article 32). It will be equal to the accepted EU contribution minus payments
received by the beneficiary (pre-financing(s) and interim payments; if any).
If the terminated beneficiary is audited later on, but while the project is still ongoing, its
amount due will be re-calculated to determine the amount to recover. If the terminated
beneficiary is audited after the end of the project, the recovery will follow the standard rules
(revised final grant amount calculated).
2. Amount due
The amount due at beneficiary termination is the part of the grant which the beneficiary is
entitled to keep when they leave the project.
Calculation of the amount due at beneficiary termination:
Step 1 — Calculation of the accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
concerned, the granting authority will add the two following:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted costs for the beneficiary (i.e. costs declared in the interim and
termination reports and accepted by the granting authority; see Articles 6 and
27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount for
the beneficiary.
Depending on whether termination is initiated by the beneficiaries or the
granting authority, only costs incurred (see Article 6.1(a)) until end-of-work
date or date of which termination takes effect are eligible (except for costs for
the termination report). Costs relating to contracts due for execution (i.e.
delivery) after end-of-work/termination are NOT eligible (except for pillar-
assessed participants, see Article 10.3).
If the beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, the accepted EU contribution will
be this lower requested amount.
If the beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS,
see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the termination report
but fails to do so, the maximum EU contribution will be capped at the CFS
threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for
costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU contribution
to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the CFS, the maximum EU
contribution to costs will be capped at EUR 429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 60 days of the
date on which termination takes effect), costs and contribution that were not included in an
approved periodic financial report will NOT be taken into account for the calculation of the
accepted EU contribution. The granting authority will NOT send a written reminder and will
not extend the deadline.
228EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article
28), for example if the beneficiary has committed a serious breach of obligations
under the Grant Agreement, the EU contribution will be reduced (decreased)
accordingly. The final result will be the total accepted EU contribution for the
beneficiary.
Balance (amount to be paid or recovered):
The balance (amount to be paid or recovered) will be equal to the accepted EU contribution
minus payments received by the beneficiary (pre-financing(s) and interim payments; if any).
The amount of pre-financing(s) and interim payments received must be communicated to the
granting authority by the coordinator via the report on distribution of payments that must be
submitted as part of the termination (see Article 32.2.2). If the coordinator does not submit
the report on the distribution of payments, the terminated beneficiary will NOT have to repay
any amounts to the consortium.
If the amount due is positive (more accepted EU contribution than payments made), the
granting authority will include the difference in the next interim/final payment to the
consortium.
If the amount due is negative (less accepted EU contribution than payments made), the
beneficiary must pay back the difference, i.e. the money it received in excess, to the
consortium.
Example for calculating the amount due at beneficiary termination:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100 %. No contributions.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Accepted EU contribution: Beneficiary A goes bankrupt in the middle of the action and is terminated
at month 18 (of 36), just before the end of RP1.
Costs declared by beneficiary A in the termination report = EUR 62 500.
Costs rejected for beneficiary A following audit = EUR 12 500.
Accepted costs beneficiary A: EUR 62 500 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 50 000.
Application of funding rate: EUR 50 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Beneficiary balance: Payments received by beneficiary A (according to the report on the distribution
of payments): EUR 60 000.
Beneficiary A balance = EUR 50 000 (accepted EU contribution) – EUR 60 000 (payments received)
= EUR -10 000 (excess payments of EUR 10 000).
Recovery: Amount to be recovered from beneficiary A: EUR 10 000 (negative balance of EUR 10 000
must be returned to the consortium).
3. Procedure
I granting authority will inform the beneficiary concerned about the termination calculations
and give them the opportunity to provide observations (beneficiary termination calculation
letter and final letter).
If the balance is negative, a mechanism is needed to recover this amount and ensure that it
is paid back to the consortium (who will need the missing float to successfully complete the
project). The procedure depends on the type of programme (with or without MIM):
For programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE), the granting authority will
inform the beneficiary concerned about the amount that needs to be returned to the
consortium (and the obligation to do so). For the rest, this will however be treated as a
229EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
matter for the consortium to deal with, and the granting authority will therefore not intervene
any further.
For programmes with MIM (HE only), the granting authority will make sure that the
amount in question is recovered from the beneficiary concerned and injected back into the
consortium (debit note issued by the EU). If the beneficiary doesn’t honour the debit note,
the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and then recover the amount for the
MIM (if needed by enforcing the recovery, using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4).

General > Article 22.3.3 Interim payments
22.3.3 Interim payments
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible costs and contributions claimed for the implementation of the action
during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out the Data Sheet
(see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the reporting period, by
first calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the accepted costs of
each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold cappings
(if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and
financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary termination (if any).
The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
[OPTION for programmes with early pre-financing clearing (before reaching the interim payment ceiling):
If pre-financing clearing before reaching the interim payment ceiling is provided for in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2), the total accepted EU contribution will be lowered to clear the amount of pre-financing payments
previously made.]
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of pre-financing and interim payments (if
any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts owed
by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
1. Interim payments
During the project, the granting authority will make interim payments, if this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement.
The amount of the interim payments will be calculated on the basis of the costs and
contributions reported in the financial statements and the (previous pre-financing and/or
interim) payments already made.
Cost and contributions accepted in a periodic report may still be rejected later if a check,
review, audit or investigation finds out that they were not eligible.
231EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Calculation of interim payments:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution for the action for the
reporting period concerned, the granting authority will add the two following:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted costs reported in the financial statements (see Articles 6 and 27) by
the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount for the
consortium.
The following amounts will flow into the calculation of the maximum EU
contribution to costs for the interim payment to the consortium:
− If a beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, its accepted EU
contribution will be this lower requested amount.
− If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS, see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the
periodic report but fails to do so, its maximum EU contribution will be
capped at the CFS threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU
funding for costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the
requested EU contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not
submit the CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be capped at EUR
429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If during the reporting period the participation of a beneficiary was terminated and if a
grant reduction was applied to the terminated beneficiary, the amount of that grant
reduction will reduce the accepted EU contribution.
Step 2 — Capping the amount at the interim payments ceiling
If the total accepted EU contribution is more than the ceiling set out in the Data Sheet
(Point 4.2) minus the pre-financing(s) and previous interim payments, the payment
will be capped at that limit. The pre-financing clearing is automatically recorded with
costs above the interim payment threshold (normally 90%).
Examples for calculating interim payments:
Case 1:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 1 000 000 and 100% funding rate. No contributions.
Pre-financing of EUR 333 334.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 1 000 000 = EUR 900 000
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by the consortium for RP1: EUR 625 000.
After checking the reports EUR 25 000 claimed by beneficiary A and EUR 15 000 claimed by
beneficiary B are considered not eligible. The granting authority therefore rejects EUR 40 000.
Total accepted costs RP1: EUR 585 000.
Application of funding rate: 100% = EUR 585 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing = EUR 900 000 – EUR 333 334
[pre-financing payment] = EUR 566 666.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 566 666 [EUR 585 000
accepted contribution capped by the interim payment ceiling of EUR 900 000 minus pre-financing of
EUR 333 334].
232EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The difference between 566 666 and 585 000 will be cleared from the pre-financing.
Interim payment RP 2:
Total accepted costs RP2: EUR 162 500.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0 (the 90% ceiling of EUR
900 000 has already been reached after RP1: EUR 333 334 [pre-financing payment]+ EUR 566 666
[RP1 interim payment]).
The accepted cost will be used to further clear the pre-financing.
Case 2 (grant with terminated beneficiary):
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100%. No contributions.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 500 000 = EUR 450 000.
Beneficiary A was terminated before the end of RP1 and the amount due was its accepted costs :EUR 62
500 EUR (no grant reductions applied).
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by beneficiary A: EUR 62 500.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1: EUR 143 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1: EUR 112 500.
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 62 500 + EUR 143 750 + EUR 112 500 = EUR 318 750.
Some costs declared by beneficiary B are rejected for an amount of EUR 12 500. Total accepted costs
RP 1: EUR 318 750 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 306 250.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 306 250 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing = EUR 450 000 [ceiling] – EUR
200 000 [pre-financing payment] = EUR 250 000.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250 000 [EUR 306 250
accepted contribution capped by the interim payment ceiling of EUR 450 000 minus pre-financing of
EUR 333 334].
Case 3:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100%.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 500 000 = EUR 450 000.
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP1: EUR 118 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1: EUR 143 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1: EUR 112 500.
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 118 750 + EUR 143 750 + EUR 112 500 = EUR 375 000.
Some direct costs declared by beneficiary A are rejected for an amount of EUR 12 500.
Total accepted costs RP 1: EUR 375 000 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 362 500.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 362 500 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing: EUR 450 000 – EUR 200 000 = EUR
250 000.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250 000.
Interim payment RP2:
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP2: EUR 25 000.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP2: EUR 37 500.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP2: EUR 37 500.
Total costs declared RP2: EUR 25 000 + EUR 37 500 + EUR 37 500 = EUR 100 000.
Costs rejected for beneficiary B at RP2: EUR 12 500.
Costs rejected for beneficiary C at RP2: EUR 6 250.
233EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Total accepted costs RP2 = EUR 81 250.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 81 250 (total accepted EU contribution).
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0 (the 90% limit has already
been reached in RP1: EUR 200 000 + EUR 250 000 = EUR 450 000).
2. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the coordinator about the interim payment calculations and
give them the possibility to submit observations (payment letter and final letter).
234EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 22.3.4 Final payment
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the remaining part of the eligible costs and
contributions claimed for the implementation of the action(if any).
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all reporting
periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the total
accepted costs of each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs, CFS
threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump
sum contributions and financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting amount is the
‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
If the resulting amount is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.2, it will be limited to
the latter.
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
If the no-profit rule is provided for in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2), the grant must not produce a profit (i.e.
surplus of the amount obtained following Step 2 plus the action’s revenues, over the eligible costs and
contributions approved by the granting authority).
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4), for beneficiaries that are
profit legal entities [OPTION for programmes with exception for revenues: [OPTION if selected for the call:
(— with the exception of [insert exceptions], which are not considered as revenues)]].
If there is a profit, it will be deducted in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of the eligible costs
approved by the granting authority (as compared to the amount calculated following Steps 1 and 2 minus the
contributions).
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of pre-financing and interim
payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{final grant amount
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments made (if any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The amount retained for the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism (see above) will be released and paid to the coordinator (in accordance with the rules
governing the Mechanism).]
235EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts owed by
a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
If [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): — despite the release of the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism contribution —] the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be recovered and
the reasons why
- [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): requesting a report on the
distribution of payments to the beneficiaries within 30 days of receiving notification and]
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
[OPTION 1 for programmes without Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations are submitted
(or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has received), it will confirm
the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with a debit note with the terms and date for
payment.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations are submitted (or
the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has received) and the coordinator
has submitted the report on the distribution of payments, it will calculate the share of the debt per
beneficiary, by:
(a) identifying the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:
{{{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action},
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments received by the beneficiary (if any)}}
and
(b) dividing the debt:
{{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned
divided by
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to point (a)}
multiplied by
the amount to be recovered}.
and confirm the amount to be recovered from each beneficiary concerned (confirmation letter), together
with debit notes with the terms and date for payment.
The debit notes for beneficiaries will include the amounts calculated for their affiliated entities (if any).
If the coordinator has not submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the granting authority will
recover the full amount from the coordinator (confirmation letter and debit note with the terms and date
for payment).]
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.
236EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Final payment — Recoveries?
At the final payment (payment of the balance), the granting authority must close the
accounts for the action.
The final payment amount (to be paid or recovered) will be calculated on the basis of the
costs and contributions reported in the financial statements and the payments already made.
Cost and contributions accepted in a periodic report may still be rejected later if a
check, review, audit or investigation finds out that they were not eligible.
2. Final grant amount
The final grant amount is the total EU contribution to which the consortium as a whole is
entitled to at the end of the action. It can never be higher than the maximum grant amount
in Annex 2, but it can be lower if there are insufficient total accepted eligible costs and
contributions or if the granting authority applies a grant reduction (see Article 28).
The final grant amount will depend on two types of criteria:
− implementation criteria, i.e. was the action implemented as described in Annex 1
and in accordance with the obligations set out in the Grant Agreement.
This is mostly a technical analysis by the granting authority of the work performed
during the action, as compared with the activities set out in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. If the action was not properly implemented, the granting authority may
decide to reduce the grant (see Article 28).
− financial criteria, including:
− the amount of (accepted) eligible costs and contributions
− the funding rate(s)
− the maximum grant amount (Annex 2)
− the profit.
Calculation of the final grant amount:
Step 1 — Total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the total accepted EU contribution for the action, the granting
authority will determine the following elements:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted eligible costs reported in the financial statements (see Articles 6
and 27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount
for the consortium.
− If a beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, its accepted EU
contribution will be this lower requested amount.
− If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS, see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the
periodic report but fails to do so, its maximum EU contribution will be
capped at the CFS threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
237EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: The beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for
costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU
contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the
CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be capped at EUR 429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article
28), for example due to improper implementation of the action, the EU contribution
will be reduced (decreased) accordingly. The final result will be the total accepted
EU contribution.
Step 2 — Limit to maximum grant amount
If the total accepted EU contribution is higher than the maximum grant amount for the
action in Annex 2, it will be capped at the maximum grant amount.
Step 3 — No-profit rule (if applicable; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2)
For entities that work for profit (in their usual activities), EU grants must not have the
purpose or effect of producing a profit during the action. Beneficiaries that are profit
legal entities (and that do not fall under any of the other exceptions, see below) must
therefore declare their revenues at the end of the action.
For the calculation of the profit, only the EU grant (and other EU grants, if any; see
Article 6.3) and the revenues from the action (e.g. from the sale of results, such as
products, services and publications, conference fees) are taken into account. Grants from
other donors for the action or for the activities of the beneficiaries (‘financial
contributions’) are NOT considered as revenue.
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4),
for beneficiaries that are profit legal entities. The revenue must be:
− established (i.e. revenue that has been collected AND entered in the accounts)
− generated (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but which has been
generated)
or
− confirmed (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but for which the
beneficiary has a commitment or written confirmation).
Exceptions: Only for-profit entities must declare revenues. In addition, certain types
of grants are exempted:
− actions with the objective to reinforce the financial capacity of the beneficiaries
(— this should be clear from the call)
− actions where the continuity after their end is to be ensured by the income
generated by the action (— this should be clear from the call)
− grants in the form of study, research or training scholarships paid to natural
persons or as other forms of direct support paid to natural persons who are
most in need (e.g. refugees, the unemployed)
− grants with a maximum amount of not more than EUR 60 000 (low value
grants)
Profit calculation and deduction: The declared revenues will be taken into account
by the system and the profit (if any) will be deducted from the amount resulting from
238EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of eligible costs (i.e. not the
entire profit is deducted, only an amount proportionate to the EU share of funding the
action):
{profit}
multiplied by
{final rate of reimbursement of the eligible costs}
The profit is calculated as follows:
{((amount after step 2 [the lower of total accepted EU contribution or maximum grant
amount]) plus action revenue) minus accepted eligible costs}
The final rate of reimbursement is distinct from the funding rate. It is the
proportion of EU funding, i.e. the eligible cost of the action compared to the final
grant amount. It is calculated as follows:
{(Amount after step 2 [the lower of total accepted EU contribution or maximum grant
amount]) divided by accepted eligible cost}
Balance — Payment or recovery:
The balance (amount to be paid or recovered) will be equal to the final grant amount minus
the payments already made to the consortium (pre-financing(s) and interim payments).
If the resulting amount is positive (final grant amount higher than payments made), the
granting authority will pay the difference as final payment.
If the resulting amount is negative (final grant amount lower than payments made), the
final payment will take the form of a recovery (the consortium will have to pay back the EU
contribution received in excess).
Example for calculating the final grant amount:
At the end of an action with a maximum grant amount of EUR 1 million and a funding rate of 70% the
beneficiary, a private IT-startup, submits the last periodic report for the final payment. The beneficiary
has declared eligible cost of EUR 1,7 million during all reporting periods. The financial statements of the
beneficiary show that profit was generated due to a ministry of a Member State procuring for EUR 800
000 a licence for the use of an IT tool developed under one of the work packages during the last
reporting period of the action. The grant does not provide for a specific exemption from the no-profit
rule.
Relevant data (see Data Sheet):
Exempted: No (no specific exemption under the grant, and no general exemption as the IT-startup is
a for-profit entity)
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 1 000 000
Funding rate: 70%
Accepted eligible cost: EUR 1 700 000
Revenue: EUR 800 000
Step 1 – Total accepted EU contribution: With a funding rate of 70% applied to the accepted
eligible cost of EUR 1 700 000, the maximum EU contribution to costs would be
EUR 1 700 000 x 0.7 = EUR 1 190 000.
Step 2 – Limit to maximum grant amount: However, the accepted EU contribution of EUR 1 190
000 amount is capped by the maximum grant amount to EUR 1 000 000.
Step 3 – No–Profit: The profit would be EUR 1 000 000 [EU grant from step 2 amount] + EUR 800
000 [revenue] – EUR 1 700 000 [accepted eligible cost] = EUR 100 000
The amount to be deducted would be the profit multiplied by the final rate of reimbursement:
EUR 100 000 [profit] x (EUR 1 000 000 [step 2 amount] / EUR 1 700 000 [accepted eligible cost]).
That is EUR 100 000 [profit] x 58,82% [final rate of reimbursement] = EUR 58 820
Final grant amount = EUR 1 000 000 [step 2 amount] – EUR 58 820 [profit deduction] = EUR 941

239EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Specific cases (final payment):
Combining EU Synergy actions — If the same action received more than one source of EU
funding (only allowed for actions flagged as ‘Synergy action’, see Data Sheet, Point 1), at
final payment it needs to be ensured that the combined actual funding rates do not go
beyond 100% of the accepted eligible cost of the action and the total EU funding (of all EU
grants combined) will accordingly be taken into account for the calculation of revenue.
Income from exploitation of results (HE only) — For actions under Horizon Europe,
income generated by the exploitation of results are NOT considered as revenues. Exploitation
is defined in Annex 5 (e.g. commercialising a product or service).
Income from building up of reserves (operating grants in all programmes) — For
operating grants, amounts which are dedicated to the building up of reserves are NOT
considered as revenues.
Release of the contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM) (HE only) —
For programmes with MIM, the contribution to the MIM that was kept from the pre-financing
(see the specific cases on pre-financing in Article 22.3.1) must be released back to the
consortium.
If the balance is positive, the contribution will be released in a separate payment.
If the balance is negative, the amount to be recovered (debt) will be first compensated
against the MIM contribution released. If this amount is enough to cover the debt, the
recovery process ends here (the consortium will be paid out the remainder of the MIM
contribution, if any is left after the compensation). If the released contribution is not
sufficient to cover the debt, the rest will be recovered (see procedure below).
3. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the consortium about the final payment calculations and
give them the opportunity to provide observations (payment letter and final letter).
If the balance is negative, the amount needs to be recovered. The procedure depends on the
type of programme (with or without MIM).
For programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): At the payment of the
balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole amount that needs to be recovered (i.e.
paid back to the granting authority) — even if it has not been the final recipient of the
concerned amount.
Therefore, the coordinator will receive the final letter with a debit note for the full amount of
the debt of the consortium, with the instructions for payment. If the coordinator does not pay
the debt, the granting authority will enforce the recovery using the mechanisms set out in
Article 22.4.
For programmes with MIM (HE only):
The coordinator is not fully liable for the whole amount that needs to be recovered; each
beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid
for costs declared by their affiliated entities.
Therefore, the coordinator will receive a request to submit the report on the distribution of
payments (in the payment letter) and the negative balance (debt) will be split among the
beneficiaries that received more money than their share in the final grant amount (payments
in excess; based on their eligible costs and contributions). Each beneficiary’s share in the
debt is calculated using the formula:
{((total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary)
divided by
240EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
total accepted EU contribution for the action)
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action}
The negative balance will be then divided among those beneficiaries who received payments
in excess, in proportion to their relative share of the total payments in excess. Each of those
beneficiaries will receive a separate debit note for their share of the debt, with the
instructions for payment (beneficiary recovery letter).
For each beneficiary that does not pay their debt, the granting authority will enforce the
recovery using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4.
Beneficiaries who did not receive more money than their share of the final grant amount will
thus not have to contribute to the repayment of the negative balance. Similarly, the
coordinator is only liable for the full amount of the debt, if they did not submit the report on
the distribution of payments (only in this case will they receive a debit note for the full
amount).
Example (negative balance with MIM):
Grant with four beneficiaries: A, B, C, D.
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 3 000 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts: A= EUR
800 000; B= EUR 1 200 000; C= EUR 600 000; D= EUR 400 000).
Funding rate: 100 %.
MIM contribution: 5% of 3 000 000 = EUR 150 000.
Payments received: EUR 2 700 000 (EUR 150 000 retained for the MIM).
Final grant amount:
Total accepted costs: EUR 3 080 000.
Application of the funding rate: 100% = EUR 3 430 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Grant reduction of EUR 400 000
Accepted EU contribution: 3 080 0–0 - 400 000 = EUR 2 680 000.
Limit to maximum grant amount: not applicable (because maximum grant amount > accepted EU
contribution)
No receipts/profit.
Final grant amount: EUR 2 680 000
Balance & MIM release:
Payments made: EUR 2 700 000.
Balance: EUR 2 680 000 (final grant amoun–) - EUR 2 700 000 (payments made) = EUR -20 000 (excess
payments of EUR 20 000).
Compensating against MIM and release: EUR 150 000 – 20 000 = EUR 130 000.

General > Article 22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount — Recovery
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount — Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see Article 25) —
the granting authority rejects costs or contributions (see Article 27) or reduces the grant (see Article 28), it
will calculate the revised final grant amount for the beneficiary concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary, by
calculating the ‘revised accepted costs’ and ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total accepted EU
contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its share in the final
grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is calculated as
follows:
{{{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action}.
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the
observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with
a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.
1. Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery?
If there is an audit (or similar, such as for instance an OLAF investigation) after the end of
the action which finds ineligible costs or contributions (or breaches that require a grant
reduction), the granting authority will have to recalculate the grant for the beneficiary
concerned.
The amount to be recovered after the final payment will be calculated by comparing the
beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount (i.e. at the final payment of the grant) and the
beneficiary’s revised final grant amount (i.e. amount entitled to after the audit).

In order to calculate the amount of revised accepted EU contribution for the
beneficiary concerned, the granting authority will consider the:
− maximum revised EU contribution to costs, which is the result of
multiplying the accepted costs for the beneficiary, after implementation of the
adjustments (see Articles 6, 25 and 27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and
sum them up to a total amount for the beneficiary.
− revised accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-
rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs after the
adjustments.
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article 28),
for example if the audit finds irregularities in the action implementation by the
beneficiary, the revised accepted EU contribution will be reduced (decreased)
accordingly. The final result will be the revised total accepted EU contribution for
the beneficiary.
Amount to be recovered:
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e.
its share in the final grant amount for the action), there will need to be a recovery of the
difference.
The beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount (what the beneficiary was entitled to, based
on its eligible costs and contributions, when the final payment was done) is:
{((total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary) divided by (total accepted EU contribution for
the action)) multiplied by final grant amount for the action}
The beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount is not necessarily equal to the money it
received from the coordinator. The consortium may have decided on a different distribution of
the EU funding. However, the amount to be recovered will be calculated using the
beneficiary’s notional share irrespectively of the amount it actually received from the
coordinator.
The amount to be recovered from the beneficiary will be:
{the beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount}
minus
{the beneficiary’s revised final grant amount}
2. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the beneficiary concerned about the audit implementation
calculations and give them the opportunity to provide observations (audit implementation
pre-information letter and final letter).
For the recovery process, see Article 22.2. If the beneficiary does not pay the debt, the
granting authority will enforce the recovery using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4.

General > Article 22.4 Enforced recoveries
22.4 Enforced recoveries
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts
owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may be offset
before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency,
debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) [OPTION 1 for programmes with pre-financing guarantees: by drawing on the financial
guarantee(s) (if any)][OPTION 2 for programmes without pre-financing guarantees: financial
guarantee(s): not applicable]
(c) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: by holding other
beneficiaries jointly and severally liable (if any; see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)] [OPTION 2 for
programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: joint and several liability of
beneficiaries: not applicable]
(d) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of affiliated entities: by holding
affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)][OPTION 2 for
programmes without joint and several liability of affiliated entities: joint and several liability of
affiliated entities: not applicable] or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that the granting authority is the European
Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable decision under Article 299 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation
2024/2509.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If the Mutual Insurance Mechanism
was called on by the granting authority to intervene, recovery will be continued in the name of the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism. If two debit notes were sent, the second one (in the name of the Mutual Insurance
Mechanism) will be considered to replace the first one (in the name of the granting authority). Where the
MIM intervened, offsetting, enforceable decisions or any other of the above-mentioned forms of enforced
recovery may be used mutatis mutandis.]
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 22.5,
from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the full payment is
received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against
the principal.
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless Directive 2015/236642
applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by offsetting or
enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission (see also Article 43).

244EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Enforced recoveries
If the coordinator/beneficiary concerned does not pay a debit note by the specified deadline,
the granting authority will recover the amount (with interest at the rate set out in Article
22.5), in one of the following ways:
− by offsetting it
− for programmes with pre-financing guarantees (most programmes, except HE): by
drawing on the financial guarantee(s) (if any)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): by drawing on the Mutual Insurance
Mechanism (MIM), and then follow up with a debit note on behalf of the MIM against
the debtor (and continue the recovery procedure applying any of the other measures
to enforce the recovery)
− if the granting authority has requested joint and several liability: by calling upon
the beneficiary(ies) or affiliated entities concerned (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
or
− by either:
− taking legal action in a national court or the European Court of Justice (see
Article 43) or
− adopting a decision that is enforceable within the meaning of Article 299
TFEU38.39
‘Offsetting’ allows to directly deduct the amount owed by the coordinator/beneficiary from
any other amount that the granting authority owes to the coordinator/beneficiary. With the
offsetting, both amounts are considered paid.
Offsetting is normally implemented as a public law measure (i.e. directly on the
basis of Article 102 of the Financial Regulation 2024/2509). Therefore, the dispute
settlement normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU action; see Article
43.2).
For the cases not covered by the Financial Regulation, offsetting will however —
exceptionally — be implemented as a purely contractual measure (e.g. offsetting against
international organisations). In this case, the normal contractual means for dispute
settlement apply (i.e. Article 272 TFEU action, arbitration, etc; see Article 43.2).
Normally, offsetting is carried out after the deadline specified in the debit note has expired.
However, in exceptional circumstances, the granting authority may offset before this date in
38 See Article 299 TFEU: “Acts of the Council, the Commission or the European Central Bank which impose a
pecuniary obligation on persons other than States, shall be enforceable. Enforcement shall be governed by the
rules of civil procedure in force in the State in the territory of which it is carried out. The order for its
enforcement shall be appended to the decision, without other formality than verification of the authenticity of
the decision, by the national authority which the government of each Member State shall designate for this
purpose and shall make known to the Commission and to the Court of Justice of the European Union. When
these formalities have been completed on application by the party concerned, the latter may proceed to
enforcement in accordance with the national law, by bringing the matter directly before the competent authority.
Enforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court. However, the courts of the country concerned
shall have jurisdiction over complaints that enforcement is being carried out in an irregular manner.”
39 See Article 100(2) Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 100(2) Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
245EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
order to safeguard the EU financial interests (see Article 102(1) Financial Regulation
2024/250940).
If the offsetting takes place after the deadline for payment has expired, the interest must
also be offset. The interest is normally offset first, before the principal amount.
‘Drawing on the MIM’ is available only for programmes with MIM (HE only). For 2021-2027,
MIM interventions are limited to defaults in the context of beneficiary terminations and
negative payment of the balance (see Articles 22.3.2 and 22.3.4); the MIM can no longer be
called on to intervene after the payment of the balance (see Article 22.3.5).
‘Joint and several liability’ means to hold another participant liable for paying the debit note.
There are two types of joint and several liability:
− joint and several liabilities of beneficiaries (only for programmes without MIM; all
programmes except HE) — ONLY if selected by the granting authority during grant
preparation; check the Data Sheet
− joint and several liability of affiliated entities (all programmes) — ONLY if selected by
the granting authority during grant preparation; check the Data Sheet
These joint and several liability regimes are subject to ceilings. Affiliated entities are
generally only liable up to their maximum grant amount in Annex 2. This is also the default
option for beneficiaries (‘limited liability’), but for them the granting authority may also select
another option (either up to the maximum grant amount for the action (‘unconditional
liability’) or no joint and several liability (‘individual liability’)).
‘Enforceable decisions’ are public law decisions, taken directly on the basis of Article 100(2)
of the Financial Regulation 2024/250941. The decision will contain a summary of the claim,
state that the debtor has not paid its debt (despite having been sent a debit note and several
reminders) and indicate the amount of the debt. The decision — duly endorsed with the order
for enforcement issued by the competent authority in the Member State concerned — allows
to have the debtor’s assets seized. Since they are public law decisions, the dispute
settlement normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU action; see Article
43.2).
Specific case (recoveries):
International organisations (IOs) — Enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU (and
other public law decisions) will NOT be taken against international organisations where this
would be contrary to the privileges and immunities accorded by their constituent documents
or international law (see Article 10.2).
Offsetting (see Article 102 of the Financial Regulation 2024/250942) is — by contrast — a
measure that may be taken in relation to international organisations, however NOT as public
law measure as such but as a purely contractual measure (on the basis of Article 22.4 of the
Grant Agreement). Offsetting for international organisations will therefore be subject to the
contractual means for dispute settlement (i.e. arbitration; see Article 43.2).

22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the beneficiaries are
entitled to late-payment interest at the rate applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) for its main
refinancing operations in euros (‘reference rate’), plus the rate specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The
reference rate is the rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the coordinator only on
request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional and local
government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State for the purpose of this
Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not be considered
as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for payment (see
above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.
22.5.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see
Article 29) and the grant or the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Late-payment interest (to be paid by the EU)
If the granting authority pays late, i.e. beyond the payment deadlines, it will automatically
pay the consortium late payment interest for the overdue period unless:
− all beneficiaries in the Grant Agreement are Member States or entities acting on behalf
of Member States or
− the deadline for payment is actually not overdue because the payment deadline is
formally suspended (see Article 29) or payments are formally suspended (see Article
30) or
− the amount of the late-payment interest is not higher than EUR 200, in which case it
will only be paid upon request from the coordinator.
Late-payment interest is paid separately and on top of the grant amounts.
Late-payment interest may also be due from the beneficiaries, if they must pay back
undue amounts in the context of a recovery and are late with this payment (see Article 22.2).

[OPTION 1 for programmes without pre-financing guarantees: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with pre-financing guarantees:
23.1 Pre-financing guarantee
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2), the beneficiaries must provide (one or more)
pre-financing guarantee(s) in accordance with the timing and the amounts set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them to the granting authority in due time before the pre-financing they are
linked to.
The guarantees must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the following
conditions:
(a) be provided by a bank or approved financial institution established in the EU or — if requested by
the coordinator and accepted by the granting authority — by a third party or a bank or financial
institution established outside the EU offering equivalent security
(b) the guarantor stands as first-call guarantor and does not require the granting authority to first have
recourse against the principal debtor (i.e. the beneficiary concerned) and
(c) remain explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the form of a
recovery, until five months after the debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
They will be released within the following month.
23.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If the beneficiaries breach their obligation to provide the pre-financing guarantee, the pre-financing will not
be paid.
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.]
1. Pre-financing guarantees (most programmes, except HE)
What? For programmes that allow for pre-financing guarantees (most programmes except
HE), a guarantee may be required in particular where the financial capacity checks of one (or
more) of the beneficiaries in the consortium reveal weaknesses. The guarantee will be asked
from the coordinator, for the entire consortium. It allows the granting authority to protect
itself against the risk of losing pre-financing (i.e. the consortium not being able to honour a
recovery debt at the end of the action).
When? Where required by the granting authority, guarantees are a prerequisite for paying
out the pre-financing. They are therefore usually requested during grant preparation and
have to be provided by the coordinator before grant signature.
However, the obligation to provide a valid guarantee continues to apply during the entire
project. If for any reason the guarantee becomes invalid (e.g. because the issuing bank
ceases its operations), it needs to be replaced by a new guarantee. If the coordinator
refuses to provide a new guarantee, the grant can be terminated.
248EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
How? Pre-financing guarantees usually take the form of a guarantee by a bank or other
approved financial institution established in the EU. The costs for obtaining such a guarantee
can be declared as eligible cost under the Grant Agreement. If accepted by the granting
authority, guarantees can also be obtained from other providers (e.g. subsidiaries may obtain
a guarantee from their parent company).
The pre-financing guarantee must be sent by the coordinator as original (by registered post
with proof of delivery OR courier service) to the postal address of the granting authority.

covered by the certificate and will not be counted for calculating the threshold (if any). ]

consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. Certificate on the financial statements
What? If a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) is required for an interim or final
payment, the beneficiaries (and affiliated entities) concerned must provide it as part of the
periodic reporting (see Article 21.2).
The CFS is a certificate covering the actual costs and costs (or contributions) according to
usual accounting practices contained in a financial statement.
It is based on agreed-upon procedures within the meaning of International Standard on
Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (revised) for Agreed-upon Procedures Engagements issued by
the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
Provided that the provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC (or similar standards) are complied
with, the participant is free to choose a qualified external auditor, including its usual
external auditor:
251EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘qualified’ means qualified in accordance with national legislation implementing
Directive 2006/4343 (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive)
− ‘external’ means the auditor is independent from the participant.
In accordance with the agreed-upon procedures set out in the CFS, the CFS auditor must
report on the correct declaration of cost in the financial statement, i.e. that they are
accurately recorded in the beneficiary’s accounting system and eligible.
The CFS auditor has to explain findings of deviation from the rules (for any reason) in detail
in the certificate. The granting authority will consider the explanation in light of the facts
reported by the auditor, and decide on steps to take.
If the auditor finds discrepancies/exceptions, the cost item should normally not be
included in the financial statement submitted to the granting authority (and does not need to
be mentioned in the CFS). However, if the issue cannot be rectified by excluding the costs
from the financial statement or is of more serious systemic nature, it should be reported to
the EU project officer in charge of your grant.
When & How? The CFS must be provided by the beneficiary concerned, as part of their
financial report, directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool. The template is available there
for download.
The CFS threshold and schedule are set out in the Data Sheet, Point 4.3. It depends on the
amount of EU contribution requested (new for 2021-2027: not only the amount of actual
costs and unit costs according to usual cost accounting practices declared) and is calculated
automatically by the system for each entity separately; i.e. each beneficiary/affiliated entity
must submit a CFS if they reach the threshold (without taking into account the EU
contribution requested by the others).
If the participation of the beneficiary in the grant has been audited by they granting
authority, costs and contributions covered by the audit are NOT counted for the
threshold. If nevertheless the beneficiary reaches the threshold (after deducting the costs
and contributions audited) those do not need to be covered (again) by the CFS.
If a certificate is required, it must cover all applicable cost categories set out in the template.
The costs of a required CFS are eligible under the applicable cost category (usually category
C.3 as a cost for services). The costs for CFS that are not mandatory (e.g. because the
threshold was not reached or because it was not required in that reporting period) are NOT
eligible (because not necessary for the action).
Examples (errors):

Point 4.3 of the Data Sheet: CFS mandatory only at final payment and only if requested EU
contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000

are not eligible (wrong timing)
Beneficiary B requests EUR 380 000 of EU contribution and submits a CFS at the final payment: the
costs of the CFS are not eligible (wrong threshold)

252EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The CFS does not affect the granting authority’s right to carry out its own assessment or
audits. Neither does the reimbursement of costs covered by a certificate preclude the
granting authority, the European Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), the
European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) or the European Court of Auditors from carrying
out checks, reviews, audits and investigations in accordance with the Grant Agreement.
Specific case (CFS):
Public bodies — Public bodies can choose an external auditor or an independent public
officer. In this case, independence is usually defined as independence ‘in fact and in
appearance’ (e.g. that the officer is not involved in drawing up the financial statements). It is
for each public body to appoint the public officer and ensure their independence. The
certificate should refer to this appointment.
Pillar-assessed entities — Pillar-assessed participants can choose their regular internal or
external auditors in accordance with their internal financial regulations and procedures as
assessed by the European Commission in accordance with Article 157(3) of the Financial
Regulation 2024/250944 (see Article 10.3).

methodology for declaring costs according to usual accounting practices complies with the

subsequently, unless the beneficiary concealed information for the purpose of the approval.]

1. Certificate on the compliance of the methodology for usual cost accounting
practices (CoMUC) (DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM)
What? For programmes where costs (or contributions) according to usual accounting
practices are eligible (DEP, EDF, CEF? UCPM) beneficiaries (and affiliated entities) that use
these accounting practices to charge costs under their grants may submit a certificate on the
compliance of usual cost accounting practices (CoMUC) to the granting authority for approval.
The CoMUC is a certificate covering the methodology that is used to charge costs (or
contributions) according to usual cost accounting practices.
It is a certificate based on agreed-upon procedures within the meaning of International
Standard on Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (revised) for Agreed-upon Procedures
Engagements issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
Provided that the provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC (or similar standards) are complied
with, the participant is free to choose a qualified external auditor, including its usual
external auditor:
254EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘qualified’ means qualified in accordance with national legislation implementing
Directive 2006/4345 (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive)
− ‘external’ means the auditor is independent from the participant.
When & How? Requests for approval can be submitted at any time to the granting authority
of an ongoing grant.
Best practice: In order to ensure that the auditor has enough information to get assurance on
the methodology, it is recommended to request it only after the first reporting period has
passed.
Approval is limited to the (cost) accounting practices described and certified in the certificate.
Approval is valid for:
− all grants of the beneficiary under the EU programme for which it was submitted (it is
not limited to a single grant)
− all costs and contributions declared according to the certified accounting practices,
including costs and contributions declared before the granting authority approval (if
the beneficiary can show that they were declared according to the approved
practices).
If the granting authority approves the CoMUC, it will afterwards not challenge any amounts
that the beneficiary declares using the certified methodology — unless information was
concealed or fraud or corruption was used to obtain the approval.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should nevertheless keep detailed records and other supporting
documents (to prove that their methodology complied with the rules, if necessary).
If the beneficiary changes its accounting practices, the certificate does not apply to any
cost incurred under the changed accounting practices. The beneficiary may submit another
request for approval to the granting authority for the new practices.
If the beneficiary declares personnel costs according to the changed cost accounting
practices before the new certificate is approved, it bears the full risk of non-approval and
cost rejection by the granting authority.
If the beneficiary also has grants in other EU programmes with similar cost eligibility rules,
the CoMUC can in principle also be relied on for these other programmes. However, it is at
the discretion of the granting authorities of those other programmes, whether they consider
their rules as equivalent and accept the CoMUC also for their programme.
The costs of the CoMUC are NOT eligible and cannot be charged to the EU action (because
not necessary for the action — the CoMUC is not mandatory and not linked to a specific
action).
Specific case (CoMUC):
Public bodies — Public bodies can choose an external auditor or an independent public
officer. In this case, independence is usually defined as independence ‘in fact and in

General > Article 24.4 SPA
24.4 Systems and process audit (SPA)
24.4 Systems and process audit (SPA)
[OPTION 1 by default: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with SPA: Beneficiaries which:
- use unit, flat rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to documented (i.e. formally
approved and in writing) usual costs accounting practices (if any) or
- have formalised documentation on the systems and processes for calculating their costs and
contributions (i.e. formally approved and in writing), have participated in at least […] actions under
[insert name of previous programme, e.g. Horizon 2020] and participate in at least […] ongoing
actions under [insert name of current programme, e.g. Horizon Europe]
may apply to the granting authority for a systems and process audit (SPA).
This audit will be carried out as follows:
Step 1 — Application by the beneficiary.
Step 2 — If the application is accepted, the granting authority will carry out the systems and process
audit, complemented by an audit of transactions (on a sample of the beneficiary’s [insert name
of current programme, e.g. Horizon Europe] financial statements).
Step 3 — The audit result will take the form of a risk assessment classification for the beneficiary: low,
medium or high.
Low-risk beneficiaries will benefit from less (or less in-depth) ex-post audits (see Article 25) and a higher
threshold for submitting certificates on the financial statements (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data
Sheet, Point 4.3). ]
1. Combined review (SPA)
The provision is only used by Horizon Europe and open only to a relatively small group of
beneficiaries that fulfil the criteria (repetitive and frequent participation in several consecutive
programmes required). If needed, the granting authority will provide guidance directly to the
beneficiaries concerned.

24.5 Consequences of non-compliance
24.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary does not submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) or the certificate is rejected,
the accepted EU contribution to costs will be capped to reflect the CFS threshold.
If a beneficiary breaches any of its other obligations under this Article, the granting authority may apply the
measures described in Chapter 5. ]
1. Missing CFS
If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS, see Articles 21
and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) but fails to do so, their maximum EU contribution to
costs will be capped at the CFS threshold in the Data Sheet minus one Euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for costs.
According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU contribution to costs ≥ EUR
430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be
capped at EUR 429 999.

25.1 Granting authority checks, reviews and audits
25.1.1 Internal checks
The granting authority may — during the action or afterwards — check the proper implementation of the
action and compliance with the obligations under the Agreement, including assessing costs and contributions,
deliverables and reports.
1. Checks (by the granting authority)
What & When? The granting authority may — at any moment including after the end —
check aspects relating to the grant relating to the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples:
1. After receiving the reports (see Article 21), the granting authority checks the different
documents (explanation of the work carried out, overview of the progress, explanation of the
use of resources, etc.), for consistency with the description and work plan of the action.
2. The granting authority performs a plagiarism check on documents submitted by the
consortium.
3. After receiving information about misconducts concerning an entity that participates in EU
actions, the granting authority checks all the grant in order to see if it needs to take action.
4. After the end of the action, the granting authority receives a complaint by one of the
beneficiaries that another beneficiary does not respect its intellectual property obligations and
decides to look into this allegation.
These checks may concern beneficiaries or other partners involved in the action — which is
why beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights towards
other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties providing in-kind
contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)) by
including appropriate clauses in their contracts with them, see Articles 8 and 9.
Checks themselves are internal, i.e. usually carried out directly by staff of the granting
authority based on available documents. If needed, the granting authority may, however,
request information from the beneficiaries (see Article 19.1).
Example: An internal check shows that the beneficiaries did not clearly explain the allocation
and use of resources in their periodic report. The granting authority asks for more information
by a given date.
The granting authority may carry out these checks on its own or with the assistance of
external expert(s) — without asking the beneficiaries for approval before appointing them.
In this case, the granting authority will ensure that there is no conflict of interest by asking
the expert(s) to sign a declaration.
259EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the check shows ineligible costs or contributions or serious breach of obligations, this may
lead to rejection or grant reduction and, if necessary, recovery (see Articles 27, 28 and 22.2)
or any other measure mentioned in Chapter 5.
If a more in-depth examination is required, the granting authority may start a review or an
audit.

General > Article 25.1.2 Granting authority project reviews
25.1.2 Project reviews
25.1.2 Project reviews
The granting authority may carry out reviews on the proper implementation of the action and compliance
with the obligations under the Agreement (general project reviews or specific issues reviews).
Such project reviews may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out
in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned
and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent, outside experts. If it uses outside experts,
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right to object on grounds of
commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline
requested — any information and data in addition to deliverables and reports already submitted (including
information on the use of resources). The granting authority may request beneficiaries to provide such
information to it directly. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings, including with the
outside experts.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises (including to the
outside experts) and must ensure that information requested is readily available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
On the basis of the review findings, a project review report will be drawn up.
The granting authority will formally notify the project review report to the coordinator or beneficiary
concerned, which has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations.
Project reviews (including project review reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed with the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
1. Project reviews (by the granting authority)
What? The granting authority may — at any moment and until the time-limit set out in the
Data Sheet (Point 6) — carry out a project review.
Reviews normally concern mainly the technical implementation of the action, but they may
also cover financial and budgetary aspects or compliance with other obligations under the
Grant Agreement. They usually concern the entire project, but may exceptionally also focus
on issues related to only one specific beneficiary.
They may also extend to other participants involved in the action — which is why
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights also towards
those other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients
of financial support to third parties (FSTP)) by including appropriate clauses in their contracts
with them, see Articles 8 and 9.
Project reviews consist in an in-depth examination (often done with the help of independent
experts) of the progress of the action, and in particular:
− the degree to which the work plan has been carried out and whether all expected
deliverables were completed
− whether the objectives of the action are still relevant
261EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− how resources were planned and used in relation to the achieved progress, and if their
use respected the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness
− the management procedures and methods of the action
− the beneficiaries’ contributions and integration within the action
− for Horizon Europe: the expected potential scientific, technological, economic,
competitive and social impact, and plans for using and disseminating results.
For some types of action, they are done regularly (e.g. for the periodic reports related to a
payment, to help the granting authority to properly assess the action implementation and the
work carried out by the beneficiaries), for others they are done ad hoc.
If the review shows ineligible costs or contributions, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud
or serious breach of obligations (including non- or improper implementation of the action as
described in Annex 1), this may lead to suspension, termination, rejection, grant reduction
and recovery (see Articles 30, 31, 32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and to exclusion and/or financial
penalties (see Article 34).
If carried out during the implementation of the action, a review may also recommend
reorientations to the action.
2. Procedure
How? The review will be initiated by a project review invitation letter sent to the
coordinator (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary concerned) through the Portal.
The letter will also mention the names of the independent experts that have been appointed
(if any). The consortium may object to an expert, but only on the grounds of commercial
confidentiality or conflict of interests.
The review may include on-the-spot visits or a review meeting (on the granting authority
premises or anywhere relevant for the action). If there is a meeting, the invitation will
indicate the documents that will be discussed, normally:
− Annex 1 (the contractual description of the action against which the assessment will
be made)
− for periodic reviews: the periodic report(s) (technical and financial) for the period(s)
under review (including documents related to financial/budgetary issues)
− deliverables that were due
− for final reviews: the periodic reports (technical and financial) for all periods (including
documents related to financial/budgetary issues).
The results of the review will be recorded in a project review report.
The project review report together with the granting authority comments will be notified to
the coordinator (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary concerned), who will have 30 days to
submit observations (contradictory project review procedure; not to be confused with
the separate contradictory procedure for any subsequent rejection, grant reduction or
suspension/termination procedure under Articles 27, 28, 31 and 32).
The granting authority operational services (authorising officers) will analyse the comments
received and decide on the follow-up, if any.

General > Article 25.1.3 Granting authority audits
25.1.3 Audits
25.1.3 Audits
The granting authority may carry out audits on the proper implementation of the action and compliance with
the obligations under the Agreement.
Such audits may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the beneficiary concerned and will be considered to
start on the date of the notification.
The granting authority may use its own audit service, delegate audits to a centralised service or use external
audit firms. If it uses an external firm, the beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right to object
on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline requested — any
information (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data) to verify
compliance with the Agreement. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with
Article 13.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises (including for the
external audit firm) and must ensure that information requested is readily available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which has 30 days from
receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and will be formally
notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
1. Audits (by the granting authority)
What? The granting authority may — at any moment and up until the time-limit set out in
the Data Sheet (Point 6) — carry out an audit.
Record-keeping — Once an audit has started, the beneficiary must keep ALL the
records and supporting documents until the audit procedure AND its follow-up (including
rejection, grant reduction, recovery and litigation) are completed.
Example: If the beneficiary archives the paper copies of the original supporting documentation not on
its premises, the documentation must be retrieved and sent there in time for the audit fieldwork.
Audits normally focus the financial implementation of the action by a beneficiary (i.e. financial
and budgetary implementation), but they may also cover technical aspects or compliance
with other obligations under the Grant Agreement (i.e. an in-depth examination of the
implementation of the action by the beneficiary). This examination is carried out by
professional (external or granting authority in -house) auditors according to generally
accepted audit standards.
They may also extend to other participants involved in the action — which is why
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights also towards
those other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients
263EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
of financial support to third parties (FSTP) and, for HE, also third parties providing in-kind
contributions) by including appropriate clauses in their contracts with them, see Articles 8
and 9.
With the exception of affiliated entities (who are usually audited directly; see specific cases
below), the audit procedure for any third party will formally be with the beneficiary and the
beneficiary will be responsible for ensuring that the auditors have access to all necessary
documents and to carry out checks on the third party’s premises.
If the audit shows, ineligible costs or contributions, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud
or serious breach of obligations, this may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection,
grant reduction and recovery (see Articles 30, 31, 32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and, in very serious
cases, to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see Article 34). In some cases, findings may
result in the acceptance of additional costs (if the beneficiary declared them).
Specific cases (audits):
Affiliated entities — In contrast to other third parties, the granting authority will audit
affiliated entities, as if they are beneficiaries. The audit will be carried out on the premises of
the affiliated entity and all communication concerning the audit will be carried out directly
with it (e.g. audit initiation letter, contradictory audit procedure; audit result
implementation). However, since the financial consequences in case of recovery would
normally have to be borne by the beneficiary to which the entity is affiliated (see Article
22.2), the granting authority will also notify the beneficiary about launching the audit, as well
as about a summary of its conclusions.
Audits for periodical assessment of eligible costs or contributions based on units,
lump sums and flat rates — The European Commission may also audit the accounting
records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost items for which
it has fixed unit costs or contributions, flat-rates or lump-sums (for statistical purposes or to
gather data to assess their adequacy). Such audits will normally have no direct consequences
for the beneficiaries that were audited; even if the actual costs turn out to be lower, this will
not lead to a rejection of costs (— except in exceptional cases e.g. where the audit reveals
non-compliance with other obligations, e.g. under national law or wrongful information in the
proposal, etc).
2. Procedure
How? The audit will be initiated by a letter of announcement (LoA) sent to the beneficiary
(or affiliated entity) concerned through the Portal.
If the granting authority uses an external audit firm, this letter will mention its name. The
beneficiary may object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interests
(together with the reasons why) and — if justified — the granting authority may decide to
appoint another external auditor (or, in exceptional circumstances, to carry out the audit
itself).
The audit usually involves a desk review of the documents requested from the beneficiary
and an on-the-spot visit (i.e. on the beneficiary’s premises or on the site on which the
action is being implemented). There may however also be audits that consist only in a desk
review.
The auditors will request access to a wide range of records and documentation (e.g. payslips,
labour contracts, complete statutory accounts, etc.) and will indicate how and when it must
be provided (and in which format).
The beneficiary must provide the auditors with all requested information, records and
supporting documents (in the format and within the deadline specified).
Example: A hard copy list of records from the general ledger (accounting document) disclosing
hundreds or thousands of transactions is impossible to process manually, therefore the auditors will
normally require an electronic version.
264EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Objections based on data protection or confidentiality will NOT be accepted. Where the
records and documentation contain personal data, the granting authority will process it in
compliance with Regulation 2018/1725 and the beneficiary must inform the persons
concerned about this processing (see Article 15.1).
Confidential data will be processed in accordance with Article 13.
Failure to provide the requested information (in the requested format and within the specified
deadline) will lead to the rejection of costs or contributions (and possibly other measures,
such as recovery, suspension of payments, termination, administrative and financial
penalties, etc.).
For on-the-spot audits, the beneficiary must allow access to its premises and ensure that all
records and supporting documentation are readily available. This includes granting access to
research facilities and interviewing the researchers that worked on the action.
The results of the audit will be recorded in an audit report.
The draft audit report will be sent to the beneficiary concerned, who will have 30 days to
submit observations (contradictory audit procedure; not to be confused with the separate
contradictory procedure for any subsequent rejection or grant reduction under Articles 27 and
28).
The audit procedure will be closed (by the granting authority auditors) with the final audit
report and the audit letter of conclusion (LoC) — and the file will then be passed on to
the granting authority for the follow-up, if any.
Please do NOT take any immediate action at this point — even if the audit found ineligible
costs/breaches. Do NOT deduct them from the next financial statement. The proposed
adjustments must first be analysed and will, if needed, be implemented by the granting authority
at the next payment. You will be informed by payment letter/audit implementation pre-information
letter and have another possibility to submit observations.

General > Article 25.2 Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting authorities
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights of checks,
reviews and audits as the granting authority.
1. Checks, reviews and audits (by the European Commission)
EU grants are often not managed by the European Commission itself, but by legally separate
entities such as EU executive agencies or joint undertakings. The European Commission is in
these cases not the granting authority but does retain equivalent rights for checks, reviews
and audits.
Where the European Commission conducts such a check, review or audit of an action of
another granting authority, the guidance provided above applies mutatis mutandis, see
Articles 25.1.1, 25.1.2, 25.1.3.

The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the periodic
assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.
1. Access to assess simplified forms of funding (by the European Commission)
The European Commission may access the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain
general information about real costs of cost items for which it has fixed unit costs or
contributions, flat-rates or lump-sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data to assess
their adequacy). Such access will normally have no direct consequences for the beneficiaries.
Even if the actual costs turn out to be lower than the simplified form of funding, this will not
lead to a rejection of costs.

- the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) under Regulation 2017/1939
- the European Court of Auditors (ECA) under Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU
(TFEU) and Article 263 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If requested by these bodies, the beneficiary concerned must provide full, accurate and complete information
in the format requested (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data,
including in electronic format) and allow access to sites and premises for on-the-spot visits or inspections —
as provided for under these Regulations.
To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the action, at least until
the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until any ongoing checks, reviews, audits,
investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have been concluded.

1. OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
In addition to the granting authority and the European Commission, you can also have a
check, review, audit or investigation from any of the following:
− the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF): OLAF is the EU’s anti-fraud office,
responsible for investigating fraud against the EU budget.
If the granting authority suspects that a beneficiary or third party involved in an
action committed fraud or other illegal acts, it will inform OLAF (and/or EPPO), who
may decide to investigate.
OLAF will send the outcome of the investigation to the granting authority, who will
then decide how to proceed.
− the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO): EPPO is an independent and
decentralised prosecution office of the European Union, with the competence to
investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment crimes against the EU budget, such as
fraud, corruption or serious cross-border VAT fraud.
− the European Court of Auditors (ECA): ECA is the independent external auditing
body for all European institutions. As such, it may carry out audits on all recipients of
EU funds (including beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners,
subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) and, for HE,
also third parties providing in-kind contributions).
268EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Depending on the outcome, the results of such an audit may be notified to the
beneficiary.
These bodies are not subject to the time-limits for audits and reviews set out in the Data
Sheet (Point 6) for the granting authority. They may carry out their activities at any point
during or after the action.
If the check, review, audit or investigation shows ineligible costs or contributions,
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations, it may lead
to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant reduction and recovery (see Articles 30, 31,
32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and, in very serious cases, to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see
Article 34).

25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant may lead to
rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount (see Article
22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may lead to a request
for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach
of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal prosecution under
national law.

Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to any of the measures described in Chapter 5 (i.e. cost rejections, grant
reductions, suspension, termination, etc).
If they find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations, this
may also lead to consequences in other EU grants awarded under similar conditions
(‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings leading to OLAF or EPPO investigations may also lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.

General > Article 25.5.2 Extension from other grants
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Results of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar conditions, to have
committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations that have a
material impact on this grant and
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the list of grants
affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to extend the findings
and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of costs or contributions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or recurrent errors, to
calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or recurrent errors
and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations, revised financial
statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the implementation (i.e.
start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the revised financial statements or the
announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see Articles 27 and 28).
1. Extension of findings from other grants
Findings from other EU grants may also impact the grant. Article 25.5.2 alloIhe granting
authority to apply measures (e.g. cost rejection or grant reduction) , if there were issues in
other EU grants in which the beneficiary participates or participated (i.e. including past
grants), provided that the extension is notified within the audit time limit (see DataSheet,
Point 6), and the findings have:
− ‘systemic or recurrent’ nature, meaning not just an individual occurrence in one
other grant but something expected to affect all similar activities of the beneficiary
also in other grants
Example (extension): During an audit of another grant, the granting authority detected
systematic irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs (e.g. recurrent errors in the time-
recording systems for personnel). The beneficiary has used the same practice in all EU grants.
271EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘similar conditions’, meaning that the other grant contains obligations that are
similar enough to the obligations of the present grant that errors in the other grant
would also be errors under the rules of the present grant.
Example (no extension): During an audit of the beneficiary’s participation in another grant,
the granting authority detected recurrent errors in the record of actual cost for travel and
subsistence. However, in the present grant the beneficiary uses unit cost for travel and
subsistence. Therefore other rules apply an errors in the actual cost do not affect the unit cost
under the present grant (in this case).
− ‘material impact on this grant’, meaning that findings in other grants must be
relevant in the context of implementation of the present grant, i.e. leading to a
measurable error.
Example (no extension): During an audit of another grant, the granting authority detected
systematic (accidental) errors in the calculation of depreciation of equipment of the beneficiary.
While the present grant follows the same cost eligibility rules on equipment, the beneficiary has
only declared personnel and subcontracting costs for the implementation of the present grant.
Therefore, findings on equipment costs in other grants have no impact on the present grant.
2. Procedure
How? The audit extension procedure will be initiated as part of the letter of audit
conclusions (LoC) and the beneficiary concerned will be asked to provide further
documents and information and observations.
Once the necessary documents and information are received, the audit extension procedure
will be closed (by the granting authority auditors) with the audit extension complete
letter — and the file will then be passed on to the granting authorities of the concerned
projects for the follow-up, if any.
Please do NOT take any immediate action at this point. The proposed extensions must
first be analysed and will, if needed, be implemented by the granting authorities of the
concerned projects. You will be informed by payment letter/audit implementation pre-
information letter and have another possibility to submit observations.

General > Article 25.5.2 Consequences of non-compliance
25.5.2 Consequences of non-compliance
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions insufficiently
substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 27), and the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Refusal to give access for checks, reviews, audits or investigations
The beneficiaries (and through Article 9 also the other partners involved in the action) are
obliged to give access to the granting authority/Commission/OLAF/EPPO/ECA for the checks,
reviews, audits and investigations set out in Article 25 of the Grant Agreement.
If they refuse such access or otherwise intentionally and without proper justification resist a
check, review, audit or investigation, this constitutes a breach of the Grant Agreement.
The consequences depend on the case. If the refusal means that certain costs or
contributions could not be verified (and are thus insufficiently substantiated), they will be
considered ineligible and rejected (see Article 27). In addition (or if there is no impact on
specific costs or contributions), the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).

General > Article 26 — Impact evaluations
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the objectives and
indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or beneficiaries and will be
considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact of the action,
including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may apply the
measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Impact evaluations
In principle, for 2021-2027, all programmes measure the impact of the actions through the
key performance indicators (KPIs) that are collected as part of the continuous reporting.
The formal evaluation procedure set out in this provision is therefore currently not in active
use by any of the programmes using the General Model Grant Agreement. If needed, the
granting authority will provide guidance directly to the beneficiaries.

CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
General > Article 27 — Rejection of costs/contributions
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at beneficiary termination, interim payment, final payment or afterwards —
reject any costs or contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in particular following checks, reviews,
audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant (see Article 25).
Ineligible costs or contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the coordinator or
beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary
concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the
rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory procedure with pre-
information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions, it will deduct them from the costs or contributions
declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
1. Rejection of costs or contributions
What? If the granting authority finds ineligible costs or contributions (in particular,
following a check, audit, extension of audit findings, review or investigation), it will reject
them (— in full, i.e. for the amount that is ineligible).
Grounds for cost or contribution rejection (by the EU):
▪ Costs or contributions do not comply with the Grant Agreement’s general
eligibility rules, see Article 6.1
▪ Costs or contributions do not comply with the Grant Agreement’s specific
eligibility rules, see Article 6.2
▪ Costs or contributions fall under the categories of ineligible costs or
contributions, see Article 6.3.
Whereas rejection will usually be based on findings of the granting authority under the
respective grant, it may also happen that costs or contributions are rejected based on
extension of audit findings (see Article 25.5) from other grants, if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or similar rules
applicable)
275EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the ineligibility is:
− systemic or recurrent, and
− has a material impact across grants.
When? Rejection of costs or contributions can take place at any moment — at the time of
beneficiary termination, interim payment, payment of the balance or afterwards (e.g.
following ex-post audits).
Cost or contributions must comply with general and specific eligibility conditions and not
fall under the categories of ineligible cost. Any cost or contributions that do not comply with
all of these conditions may be rejected (see Article 6).
2. Procedure
How? The beneficiaries will be informed about the cost rejections and given the opportunity
to submit their observations.
Formally speaking, the procedure is slightly different:
− if rejection leads to a recovery: the procedure is a standard contradictory
procedure
− if rejection does NOT lead to a recovery (just a decreased payment): the procedure is
apayment review procedure.
The difference in the two procedures is in the timing. In case of recoveries, there is nothing
to pay out, so the procedure foresees a standard contradictory procedure. In case of positive
amount to pay, the procedure switches to the payment review procedure in order to allow the
granting authority to immediately pay out undisputed amounts and focus the
observations/review on the disputed amounts.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Payment review procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator about the rejection of costs or
contributions and notifies the amounts that will be paid out (notification of
amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Step 2 — If the beneficiaries disagree, the coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days
to inform the granting authority of its objections.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the request for review and informs the
coordinator of its outcome.
Depending on the moment when costs or contributions are rejected, this procedure will be
directed either at the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
276EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for rejections at the time of an interim payment or the final payment: normally the
coordinator
− for rejections after beneficiary termination and after final payment: normally the
beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries
concerned via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of
delivery, etc) and ask for their comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries.
If it is directed at the beneficiary during the action, the granting authority will inform the
coordinator later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality). Beneficiaries should inform
their coordinator if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action (see Article 19.3).
If it is directed at the beneficiary after the action, beneficiaries do not have to inform their
coordinators or ask them to submit comments.
3. Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions at beneficiary termination, it will
deduct the rejected amount from the costs or contributions that the beneficiary declared in
the termination report and calculate the amount due to the beneficiary. If the amount is
lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary, the
granting authority will recover the difference (see Article 22.3.2).
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions at the moment of an interim
payment or the final payment, it will deduct them and calculate the amount to be paid
accordingly (see Articles 22.3.3 and 22.3.4).
If ineligible costs or contributions are found in-between payments, the granting authority
will reject them at the next payment (i.e. deduct the amount rejected from the amounts
declared in the next financial statement and calculate the amount to be paid accordingly; see
Article 22).
If the granting authority rejects costs after the final payment, it will deduct the amount
rejected from the amounts accepted for the beneficiary at the final payment and calculate a
revised final grant amount for the beneficiary. This may be followed by a recovery if
needed (see Article 22.3.5).
277EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 28 — Grant reduction
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — reduce the grant for
a beneficiary, if:
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including improper
implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics or security rules (if
applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant (see Article 25).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and proportionate to the
seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, by applying an
individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the coordinator
or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the reasons why. The coordinator or
beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — submit observations if it disagrees
with the reduction (payment review procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory procedure with
pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the amount due
(and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
1.Grant reduction
What? If the granting authority finds (e.g. following a check, audit, extension of audit
findings, review or investigation) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of
obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-compliance with the call
conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach of
ethics, values or security rules, etc) under the Grant Agreement or during the award
procedure, it may reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the finding.
Grant reductions will be made in proportion to the seriousness of the error, irregularity,
fraud or breach (e.g. in case of fraud the reduction may be up to a 100%).
If the issues are found before the end of the action, the beneficiaries must take all
possible corrective steps to bring the action implementation back into line with the Grant
Agreement.
1. The monthly declaration of days worked in the project correctly signed (see Article
20) OR reliable time records will normally be sufficient proof of the assignment to 278
the action — unless there is other contradicting evidence (e.g. the employment
contract indicates that the person was hired to work on another project).EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Grounds for grant reduction:
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may make a grant reduction if a beneficiary has committed
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations — either
during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement.
Serious breach of obligations may cover all kinds of non-compliance with Grant
Agreement obligations (including obligations during the award procedure).
Example: False declarations in the proposal form in order to obtain EU funding.
In practice, the most frequent breach is improper implementation of the
action/non-compliance with Annex 1 (i.e. if the work performed does not
correspond to the activities described in Annex1). This will normally be examined
on the basis of the periodic and final technical reports and, if needed, a project
review.
Breaches of other obligations, such as the obligation to respect and commit to EU
values (see Article 14), may also lead to grant reductions.
Example: A non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless of religious
or political background released very controversial statements of xenophobic nature, in
particular by calling to destroy country X. One of the activities which was supposed to be
implemented by the entity was cancelled by the subcontractor because of these
statements. In the specific context of the action in question , these statements were
considered a breach of the obligation to respect EU values (non-discrimination). This
conduct led to a reduction of the grant amount (among other measures).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also make a grant reduction, if such substantial errors,
irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants,
if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
When? Grant reductions will be made at beneficiary termination, at the end of the action or
after the payment of the balance.
2. Procedure
How? The beneficiaries will be informed about the grant reductions and given the
opportunity to submit their observations.
Formally speaking, the procedure is slightly different:
− if reduction leads to a recovery: the procedure is a standard contradictory
procedure
− if reduction does NOT lead to a recovery (just a decreased payment): the procedure is
apayment review procedure.
279EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The difference in the two procedures is in the timing. In case of recoveries, there is nothing
to pay out, so the procedure foresees a standard contradictory procedure. In case of positive
amount to pay, the procedure switches to the payment review procedure in order to allow the
granting authority to immediately pay out undisputed amounts and focus the
observations/review on the reduction.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Payment review procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator about the reduction and notifies
the amounts that will be paid out (notification of amounts due; see Article
22.3).
Step 2 — If the beneficiaries disagree, the coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days
to inform the granting authority of its objections.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the request for review and informs the
coordinator of its outcome.
Depending on the moment when reduction takes place, this procedure will be directed either
at the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
− for reductions at the time of the final payment: normally the coordinator
− for reductions after beneficiary termination and after final payment: normally the
beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries
concerned via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of
delivery, etc.) and ask for their comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries.
If it is directed at the beneficiary during the action, the granting authority will inform the
coordinator later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality). Beneficiaries should inform their
coordinator if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action (see Article 19.3).
If it is directed at the beneficiary after the action, beneficiaries do not have to inform their
coordinators or ask them to submit comments.
3. Effects
If the granting authority makes a reduction at beneficiary termination, it will deduct the
reduction from the accepted EU contribution based on the costs or contributions that the
beneficiary declared in the termination report and calculate the amount due to the
beneficiary. If the amount is lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by
the beneficiary, the granting authority will recover the difference (see Article 22.3.2).
If the granting authority makes a reduction at the final payment, it will deduct them and
calculate the amount to be paid accordingly (see Article 22.3.4).
If the granting authority makes a reduction after the final payment, it will deduct the
amount reduced from the accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary at the final payment
280EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
and calculate a revised final grant amount. This may be followed by a recovery if needed
(see Article 22.3.5).

SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
General > Article 29 — Payment deadline suspension
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment cannot be
processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or additional
information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing audit extension procedure, queries about
eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations
are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — and
the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to confirm if the
suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the revised report is
not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority may also terminate the grant or
the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. Suspension of the payment deadline (by the EU)
What? The granting authority must make its payments in accordance with the timeline set
out in the Data Sheet (usually 30 days from grant signature/start of project for initial
prefinancing and 60 or 90 days from reception of the additional pre-financing/periodic report.
If the deadline is missed, late payment interest will be due by the granting authority (see
below and Article 22.5) — unless the payment deadline has been suspended.
Suspension of the payment deadline must be distinguished from suspension of
payments (see Article 30). Suspension of the payment deadline is an ad hoc measure
regarding a pending payment. Suspension of payments is independent of any individual
payment request as a measure to stop making payments to a beneficiary which is, for
example, suspected of serious misconducts.
The payment deadline may be suspended temporarily on the grounds listed in this Article.
Grounds for suspension of the payment deadline (by the EU):
282EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Payment request is incomplete or requires clarification.
The granting authority may suspend the payment deadline, if the reports (or any
of their documents) are incomplete or unclear and the granting authority is
therefore not in a position to determine that the action has been properly
implemented and the payment is due.
Examples: the reports, the certificate on the financial statement or other supporting
documents are missing; the information in the periodic technical report is incomplete;
additional information on the coordinator’s new bank account is needed
▪ Doubts on the amount to be paid in the financial statements that require
additional verifications.
The granting authority may suspend the payment deadline, if it has doubts (e.g.
due to conflicting information between documents, or audit findings in other grants
on the eligibility of the costs in the financial statements) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are needed to establish the amount to be paid.
Example: The costs claimed in the financial statements are not consistent with the action
tasks described in the technical report.
▪ There are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
The granting authority may also suspend the payment deadline, if it has other
doubts on the eligibility of payment claims. It will request the necessary
information or enact other measures including by means of on-the-spot-checks if
necessary.
Example: The granting authority has received information that parts of the activities are
not properly implemented and subject to fraud.
2. Procedure
How? The granting authority will inform the coordinator of the suspension of the payment
deadline and explain the reasons why.
There is NO contradictory procedure for the suspension itself. However, if the suspension
exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the granting authority if the suspension is to
be continued (i.e. ask to confirm it or lift it). In addition, a contradictory procedure/payment
review will be available later on if the granting authority should eventually decide to dispute
amounts and make rejections/grant reductions).
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the day the notification (announcing payment deadline suspension) is
sent to the coordinator (and ends on the day it is lifted).
As soon as the suspension is started, passing days do no longer count towards the 60 or 90
day deadline set out in the DataSheet and accordingly no late-payment interest for the
beneficiaries will accrue. With the lifting of the suspension, the remaining payment period
starts to run again (as from the day-count on which the suspension started).
If the issues have been resolved satisfactorily (e.g. the coordinator sent the requested
information or re-submitted the report) or the granting authority has finished the necessary
verifications (e.g. an audit), it will lift the suspension and inform the coordinator.
If a deadline has been suspended for several reasons, it will be lifted only when the
consortium has satisfactorily addressed ALL the reasons.

General > Article 30 — Payment suspension
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for one or more
beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is suspected of having
committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including improper
implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics or security rules (if
applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant.
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make partial payment(s)
for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the payment (or recovery) of the
remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary
concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally
notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting authority will
formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the suspension end date.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For interim payments,
the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article 21) must not contain any
financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated entities). The coordinator must include
them in the next periodic report after the suspension is lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of
the action — in the last periodic report.
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. Suspension of payments (by the EU)
284EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What? The granting authority may suspend pre-financing, interim and final payments (for
one or more beneficiaries), on the grounds listed in this Article.
Suspension of payments has NO impact on the action implementation. The beneficiary
concerned must continue to work on the action, while addressing the issues that have led to
suspension of the payment; costs incurred during suspension of payments are in principle
eligible, but there will be no payments.
Grounds for suspension of payments (by the EU):
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may suspend payments, if a beneficiary has committed or is
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious
breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-
compliance with the call conditions, submission of false information, failure to
provide required information, breach of ethics, values or security rules, etc) —
either during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement.
Example:
1. False declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding
2. Based on information received from a third party, the granting authority suspects that
the beneficiary and the person who has powers of control towards the beneficiary are in
breach of EU values. The information received indicates that public statements which are
discriminatory and incite hate towards women have been made by the person who controls
the beneficiary. The granting authority suspended payments to the beneficiary until it
confirmed that the allegations were not supported by reliable evidence.
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also suspend payments, if such substantial errors,
irregularities- or, fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants,
if
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of
obligations are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systemic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other Grant
Agreements signed by the audited beneficiary. The grating authority may suspend all
outstanding payments for the audited beneficiary until the issue is resolved.
2. Procedure
How? Before suspending payments, the granting authority will follow a contradictory
procedure to give the beneficiary the possibility to submit observations.Contradictory
procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the beneficiary concerned of its intention (and
the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
285EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 — The beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An extension
may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the day the notification (confirming suspension) is sent to the
beneficiary concerned (and ends on the day it is lifted).
During suspension, NO individual financial statements may be submitted for the beneficiary
(or beneficiaries) concerned with the periodic reports (except with the report for the final
reporting period).
Costs incurred (for continuing to implement the action during suspension) are eligible and
may be included in the next financial report, after suspension has been lifted. At the latest,
they must be included in the periodic report for the final reporting period (— even if
suspension is still ongoing).
Technical reports submitted during suspension must include the work of the beneficiaries
concerned.
If payments for one (or some) of the beneficiaries are still suspended at the end of the
action, the granting authority will make a partial payment of the balance for the amount that
is not suspended (— but ONLY after having received all the necessary information for the
final calculations for ALL consortium members, i.e. including the suspended beneficiaries).
The partial final payment that will be paid out in this case is NOT the payment that
closes the action for the purposes of the deadlines set out in Point 6 of the Data Sheet. That
payment will be made only after the payment suspensions are lifted.

ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances — in
particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
− the reasons why
− the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request and
− the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately request another
amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption date (one day after suspension
end date), extend the duration and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see
Article 39) — unless the grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect
from the suspension end date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of
the amendment request.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for activities
implemented during grant suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. GA suspension (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the ground set out in
this Article.
GA suspension may be used exceptionally if it is necessary to stop the action
implementation, to fix specific problems. It should NOT be used in situations that cannot
be resolved through a temporary interruption of the project activities; in these cases, it may
be better to terminate the Grant Agreement (see Article 32).
Ground for GA suspension (by the Consortium):
▪ Action can no longer be implemented (or becomes excessively difficult)
The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), if implementation
becomes impossible or excessively difficult.
Example: A fire devastates a beneficiary’s premises, with most of the technical equipment
and computers used for the action and containing the action results. The beneficiaries
287EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
therefore request that the part of the action that is affected by this is suspended until the
premises are restored.
Information obligation — Depending on the reasons for suspension, the beneficiaries may
also have to take other measures under the Grant Agreement (e.g. inform the granting authority
under Article 19; notify a situation of force majeure under Article 35).
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the date the suspension takes effect (this date may be before the date of the
submission of the amendment request) and the expected date of resumption.
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the date specified in the amendment request.
The beneficiaries must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit the damage and do
their best to resume (i.e. continue) implementing the action as soon as possible.
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are
NOT eligible (see Article 6.3). Costs may again be incurred for the action, once action
implementation is resumed.
If the action can be continued (resumed), the coordinator must notify it to the granting
authority by requesting an amendment to the Grant Agreement.
The resumption amendment must again be requested in accordance with Article 39 (e.g. it
must be signed by the coordinator’s LSIGN).
It sets the resumption date and adapts the grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the
action duration, modifying Annexes 1 and 2, updating the reporting periods).
If the granting authority approves the resumption amendment, the suspension is lifted and
will be resumed as from the resumption date (i.e. one day after the suspension end date set
in the amendment, which can be retroactive, i.e. back to the date when the problem
stopped/issue was clarified).
Example: The action was suspended on 24.03.2023 due to an extreme weather event affecting the
premises of the coordinator and making continuous implementation of the action temporarily
unfeasible. After two months of clearing efforts, the conditions improve and the coordinator’s
premises are accessible again. The coordinator requests an amendment to set the suspension end
date on 22.05.2023. Therefore, the action will be resumed as from 23.05.2023.
If the suspension is lifted and the action resumes, the action’s remaining budget can be used
for action implementation.
If a part of the action cannot be implemented anymore (e.g. due to impossibility following the
circumstances causing the suspension), the granting authority may agree to amend the Grant
Agreement with changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation, including by
decreasing activities and budget unless changes are so significant that they call into question
the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment (see below and
Article 39).
288EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the action or a significant part of it can NOT be continued (or the granting authority does
not approve the amendment; see Article 39), the Grant Agreement (or the participation of
one or more beneficiaries) may be terminated.
In this case, NO further costs (incurred after the date of suspension) can be declared, except
the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1).
Example: The action starts on 01.01.2022 and is to last 36 months. The action’s implementation is
suspended for four months, from the date specified in the amendment request, e.g. 01.12.2022 to
31.03.2023 and the suspension leads to the Grant Agreement termination. The eligible costs are:
− costs incurred from the action’s start (01.01.2022) until the date specified in the
amendment request (30.11.2022)
− costs incurred for the submission of the first periodic report and the final report.

31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is suspected of having
committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including
improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions,
submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach of
ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits
and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant
(c) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes
with linked actions: [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION
2 if selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as specified in
Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute, and this impacts the
implementation of the action under this Agreement]]
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: additional GA suspension grounds: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with additional GA suspension grounds: [additional GA suspension grounds:
insert other grounds]].
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally
notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date specified
in the notification).
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority will formally
notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the suspension end date and invite
the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to set the resumption date (one day after
suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new
situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be
lifted with effect from the suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be
before the date on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for activities
implemented during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a beneficiary (see
Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
290EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. GA suspension (by the EU)
What? The granting authority may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the grounds
listed in this Article.
Grounds for GA suspension (by the EU):
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may suspend the action, if a beneficiary (or one of its
person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or one of its
person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious
breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-
compliance with the call conditions, submission of false information, failure to
provide required information, breach of ethics, values or security rules, etc) —
either during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement
Examples:
1. False declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding
2. Based on information received from a third party, the granting authority suspects that
the beneficiary and the person who has powers of control towards the beneficiary are in
breach of EU values. The information received indicates that public statements which are
discriminatory and incite to hate towards women have been made by the person who
controls the beneficiary. The granting authority suspended the Grant Agreement
implementation until it confirmed that the allegations were not supported by reliable
evidence.
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also suspend the action, if a beneficiary (or one of its
person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or one of its
person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations in other
grants, if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systematic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other Grant Agreements
signed by the audited beneficiary. The granting authority may suspend the audited
beneficiary’s part of the action until the issue is resolved.
291EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ If provided in the Grant Agreement: the linked action (see Article 3) has not
started as specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute
and this impacts the implementation of the action under the Grant Agreement.
▪ Depending on the programme and on the type of action, there may be other
specific grounds for suspension of the Grant Agreement by the granting
authority, for example:
− major delays (CEF, RENEWFM, JTM)
− loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost scientific or technological relevance.
Example: A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered
material is selected. After the action starts, a European scientific publication
demonstrates that this material contains a chemical substance that irremediably
harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot continue and the granting
authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
− loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its economic relevance
− loss of relevance as being part of a given portfolio (HE-challenge-
based EIC Pathfinder actions and Missions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially
selected.
− change of humanitarian context no longer allows the
implementation of the action (HUMA)
− suspension or termination of the cooperation or of the Financing
Agreement with the partner country in which the project takes
place (RELEX)
− change of partner country policy environment (RELEX).
Specific cases (GA suspension by the EU):
Loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE) — The granting authority may suspend
the action, if it needs time to assess whether the action has lost scientific or technological
relevance. This may in particular be the case:
− if a complete revision of Annex 1 is necessary to assess the impact of a request for
amendment
− if work has significantly deviated from the original work plan
− if a key beneficiary leaves the action and the consortium needs time to find a
replacement
− after a check, audit or review of the action.
Example: There are technical problems with implementing the work under an action as
described in Annex 1, so the consortium proposes changes to the work to be carried out. This
may jeopardise its technological relevance and the granting authority decides to suspend its
implementation and to carry out a review.
292EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions) — The granting authority may suspend the
action, if the action has lost its economic relevance.
Loss of relevance as being part of a portfolio (HE-challenge-based EIC Pathfinder actions
and Missions) — The granting authority may suspend the action, if the action has lost its
relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially selected.
2. Procedure
How? Before suspending the Grant Agreement, the granting authority will follow a
contradictory procedure to give the consortium the possibility to submit observations.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator of its intention (and the reasons
why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator has 30 days to submit observations. An extension may be
granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
If possible, the granting authority will give an estimation of how long the suspension will be
needed.
3. Effects
The suspension starts the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date
specified in the confirmation notification).
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are
NOT eligible (see Article 6.3). Eligible costs may again be incurred and declared for the
action, once the suspension is lifted.
If the action can be continued, the granting authority will lift the suspension and inform the
coordinator (together with the suspension end date).
The suspension can be lifted retroactively (i.e. back to the date when the problem
stopped/issue was clarified).
The coordinator must then request an amendment to the Grant Agreement (see Article 39),
to set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date) in the tools and adapt the
grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the action duration modifying Annexes 1 and 2,
updating the reporting periods).
If the action (or part of it) can NOT be continued, the Grant Agreement (or a beneficiary’s
participation) may be terminated.
If the suspension leads to the Grant Agreement termination, NO further costs (incurred after
the date of suspension) can be declared, except the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1).
Ineligible costs will be rejected. The grant may be reduced, if the termination is based on
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations (for instance if the
action has not been implemented properly; see Article 28). In certain cases, the granting
authority may also impose administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion and/or financial penalties;
see Article 34).

General > Article 32.1 — GA termination by consortium
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the date of the
submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify termination, it may
consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a periodic report (for
the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of the report
submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented before the
end of work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after the end of work are
not eligible.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and contributions which
are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no costs/contributions if no periodic
report was ever approved).
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and security), 16
(IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and
investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 41 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
1. GA termination (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries have the right to terminate the Grant Agreement.
GA termination should be a last-resort measure, if all efforts to continue the action fail.
If the action implementation just becomes temporarily impossible or excessively difficult, it
may be better not to terminate the grant, but to suspend it (see Article 31). In this case, the
Grant Agreement would only be terminated if it turns out later that implementation cannot be
resumed anymore.
294EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: A fire devastates premises where most of the technical equipment and computers used in
the action are stored. If the beneficiaries consider that the premises can be replaced and the action
will still be correctly implemented, they may suspend implementation and resume it when the new
laboratory is operational. However, if the action has been suspended and it is not possible to find
new premises and therefore it is impossible to resume the action, the beneficiaries may terminate
the Grant Agreement.
Grounds for GA termination (by the Consortium):
▪ Any ground that justifies early termination of the action
The beneficiaries may terminate the Grant Agreement in principle on any ground
— as long as there is a good reason (e.g. circumstances make its implementation
impossible or excessively difficult; loss of the action’s scientific or technological
relevance; force majeure).
Even if there are no legitimate reasons for discontinuing the action, the granting authority
can NOT oppose, but termination will be considered improper.
Improper termination of the Grant Agreement may lead to a grant reduction (see
Article 28).
This will be the case, for instance, if:
− the implementation of the action has become impossible or excessively difficult due to
the beneficiaries’ wilful misconduct or gross negligence
− the reasons provided are based on changes in the strategic choices of the
beneficiaries, not linked to any specific economic or operational difficulties
− implementation would have been possible if the beneficiaries had made more (but still
reasonable) efforts.
Example: The beneficiaries decide to terminate the Grant Agreement due to internal
communication and decision-making problems within the consortium, and notify the granting
authority via the coordinator. The granting authority considers that these internal problems have
jeopardised the action’s implementation, but do not justify terminating the Grant Agreement
because they could have been solved within the consortium on the basis of the consortium
agreement. This improper termination may lead to a grant reduction.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the granting authority beforehand, to discuss
the termination and possible alternatives.
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
− the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request. Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
3. Effects
295EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit the necessary reports (i.e. a periodic
report for the open reporting period until termination).
If the coordinator fails to submit the reports (within the 60 days of the date on which
termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial report
will NOT be taken into account when the final grant amount is calculated. The granting
authority will NOT send a reminder and will NOT extend the deadline.
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and the payment of the balance
(see Article 22).
If the total amount of earlier payments (pre-financing payment and interim payments, if any)
received before termination:
− is greater than the final grant amount, the balance is negative and will take the form
of a recovery (see Article 22.2)
− is lower than the final grant amount, the granting authority will pay the balance (see
Article 22.3.4).
Only costs incurred before the end of work date (i.e. generating event before the end of work
date; see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:
− costs for the reports (see Article 6.1)
Example: The action’s duration is 36 months. The starting date is 01.01.2022. The notified end
of work date is 01.05.2023. Therefore, only costs incurred in connection with the action from
1.1.2022 to 1.5.2023 (16 months) and the costs related to submission of the periodic report for
the last reporting period are eligible
− costs for (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before the end of work date
(see Article 6.1).
Example: One of the beneficiaries of the Grant Agreement has a contract to carry out 8 tests
during the action’s duration. However, only three tests out of 8 are carried out before the end of
work date. Therefore, only the costs related to these 3 tests carried out before the end of work
date may be eligible for the action.
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
Termination has NO effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action.
Obligations that continue to apply after GA termination:
▪ Keeping records and other supporting documentation (see Article 20)
▪ Submitting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination)
(see Articles 32.1.2 and 21.2)
▪ Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (e.g.
for checks, reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact;
see Articles 25 and 26)
▪ Complying with the rules on management of intellectual property, background and
results (see Article 16 and Annex 5 > IPR)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security)
▪ Complying with the security obligations (if applicable) (see Article 13 and Annex 5
> Confidentiality and security)
296EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Promoting the action and giving visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17 and
Annex 5 > Communication, dissemination and visibility)
▪ No assignment of claims for payment (see Article 42)

General > Article 32.2 — Beneficiary termination by consortium
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, on request of
the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the date of the
submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment request must
be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify termination, it
may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until
termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial statement, the
explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on the financial statement
(CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed (e.g.
reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary; addition of a
new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the report submitted
and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented before the end of
work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after the end of work are not
eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next reporting
period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the deadline, it
will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
298EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is amended to
introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into question the
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the grant may be
terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant termination (see Article
32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews,
audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 41 (assignment of
claims)) continue to apply.
1. Partner termination (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of the partners (or several),
if:
− the partner concerned can no longer participate or
− the consortium has decided to change the partner (in accordance with the internal
decision-making procedures). In this case, the consortium must inform the beneficiary
concerned, request the beneficiary’s opinion in writing and provide it to the granting
authority (or — if the beneficiary didn’t reply — provide proof that the beneficiary’s
opinion has been requested in writing).
Grounds for partner termination (by the Consortium):
▪ Any ground that justifies termination of the participation of the beneficiary
The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of their consortium
members in principle on any ground — as long as there is a good reason (e.g.
withdrawal by a beneficiary because due to a change in ownership; the beneficiary
cannot implement its tasks in the same way; bankruptcy).
If there are no legitimate reasons, the granting authority will NOT oppose beneficiary
termination, but it will be considered improper.
Improper termination of the participation of a beneficiary may lead to grant reduction
(see Article 28) or even grant termination (see Article 32.3).
Termination extends to affiliated entities. Affiliated entities cannot participate in the action
without the beneficiary they are linked to, therefore, terminating a beneficiary’s participation
implies that its affiliated entities may NOT continue participating in the action.
Best practice: Partner terminations should always be first discussed within the consortium, to
make sure that everybody agrees. In case of conflicts, they should be resolved in accordance
with the consortium agreement. The granting authority will not get involved in internal
disputes; it is the coordinator’s responsibility to handle partner terminations correctly.
299EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For beneficiaries that are involved in several EU Grant Agreements, withdrawal from one
Grant Agreement does NOT necessarily imply that it has to also withdraw from the others.
Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or the
coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority. Late information will be considered
as a breach of the information obligation under the Grant Agreement (see Article 19.4).
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
− the date the beneficiary ends working on the action (‘end of work date’)
− the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request. Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
3. Responsibility
NO amendment is needed if the termination takes effect after the end of the action (and
before payment of the balance) — unless it concerns the coordinator (since the coordinator
has many obligations also after the end of the action, e.g. submit the reports, receive the
payment of the balance and distribute the payment among the beneficiaries).
If it is rejected, the beneficiaries will have to make another proposal to the granting
authority. If a satisfactory solution cannot be found (i.e. the request for an amendment calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of the equal treatment
of applicants), the Grant Agreement may be terminated.
Example: A key beneficiary terminates its participation in the Grant Agreement. The consortium
cannot find a proper replacement and the granting authority therefore considers that the action
cannot be continued in the way for which it was originally awarded the grant.
If the amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Grant Agreement must also be
amended to introduce the necessary changes (including, if necessary, the replacement with
new beneficiaries).
4. Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit the following:
− a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
− a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate
on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
− a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with the other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary;
addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of
coordinator, etc.).
300EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best practice: If possible, the two amendments should be combined and done
together.
In case of coordinator termination, the reports must be submitted by the new
coordinator (to avoid problems with the payment). If the nomination of the new coordinator
takes more time, the 60 days deadline may be extended.
The information contained in the beneficiary’s termination report must also be included in the
periodic report for the next reporting period.
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the terminated beneficiary:
− if the granting authority owes amounts to the beneficiary, those amounts will be paid
with the following payment to the consortium (interim or final)
− if the beneficiary owes, those amounts must be paid back to the consortium.
Only costs incurred before the end of work date (i.e. generating event before the end of work
date see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:
− costs for the termination report (see Article 6.1)
− costs for (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before the end of work date
(see Article 6.1).
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 60 days of the date on
which termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial
report will NOT be taken into account when the contribution is calculated. The granting
authority will NOT send a written reminder and will not extend the deadline.
If the coordinator fails to submit the report on the distribution of payments, the beneficiary
whose participation was terminated will NOT have to repay any amounts to the consortium.
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the Grant Agreement may be terminated (see Article 32).
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action (see Article 32.2). If the second request for amendment is accepted by the
granting authority, the Grant Agreement is amended to introduce the necessary changes (see
Article 39).
If the Grant Agreement continues (i.e. it is amended), the remaining members of the
consortium (and any new beneficiaries) have the responsibility for fully implementing the
action as described in Annex 1 (see Article 7). They must carry out the action (including the
part that the defaulting beneficiary was supposed to carry out and without any additional
funding to do so).
Specific cases (partner termination by the Consortium):
Termination of the coordinator without its agreement — The decision to terminate the
coordinator must be made by the rest of the consortium (according to its internal decision-
making procedures). The notification and amendment request must be made by one of the
beneficiaries (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries; see Article 39) and the reports must
be submitted by the new coordinator (to avoid problems with the payment). If needed, the
60 days deadline for submission of the reports can be extended (see above).
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — In principle the
coordinator must be changed. If the coordinator can no longer submit the request, the same
301EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
procedure as for coordinator termination without its agreement should be used (see above
and Article 39).

32.3.2 Procedure
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will send a
pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will take effect (confirmation
letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also inform the
coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date specified
in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a periodic
report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of the
report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities
implemented before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination are not eligible.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator may not
submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and contributions
which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no costs/contributions
if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 28) or to
impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority (see Article
33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks,
reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and
41 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
304EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on
the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed (e.g.
reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary;
addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of
coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the report
submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented
before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only
after termination are not eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next
reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is amended to
introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into question the
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the grant
may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality
and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 41 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
1. GA or beneficiary termination (by the EU)
What? The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement or the participation of one
(or more) of the beneficiaries, on the grounds listed in this Article.
Beneficiary termination may lead to GA termination, if the granting authority considers
that following such beneficiary termination, the necessary changes to the Grant Agreement
(and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision awarding the grant or
breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants (see Article 32.3.1(c)).
Grounds for termination (by the EU):
▪ Non-accession to the Grant Agreement
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if one (or more)
beneficiaries did not accede to the Grant Agreement (i.e. did not sign the
305EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Accession Form within 30 days after the entry into force of the Grant Agreement or
did not provide the requested declaration on joint and several liability).
Non-accession of a beneficiary does NOT automatically lead to the Grant
Agreement termination; the consortium can find an alternative solution that
ensures the proper implementation of the action without the beneficiary (and
request an amendment; see Article 39).
In this case, the granting authority will terminate the Grant Agreement only if it
considers the solution inappropriate or if the consortium no longer complies with
the eligibility conditions set out in the call conditions (e.g. the rules
regarding the minimum number of beneficiaries, their legal situation, or their place
of establishment).
▪ Change in a beneficiary’s situation
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if there
has been a change to its (or one of its affiliated entities) legal, financial, technical,
organisational or ownership situation, that is likely to substantially affect or delay
the action’s implementation or calls into question the decision to award the grant.
Such changes can be of any kind and can be triggered by the beneficiary itself or
outside circumstances.
Examples (termination):
1. Beneficiary R moves from Europe to Australia and becomes no longer eligible for
receiving EU funding under the programme. Since participants must comply with the
eligibility conditions throughout the duration of the action, this would be a change that calls
into question the decision to award the grant and the granting authority may decide to
terminate the beneficiary’s participation in the Grant Agreement (or the entire Grant
Agreement if the other beneficiaries fail to find a solution to replace it).
2. An action’s key beneficiary is taken over by a non-European company (not entitled to
participate due to security reasons). This substantially affects the action implementation
and the ownership, protection, exploitation and dissemination of the results. The granting
authority decides to terminate the beneficiary’s participation (or the Grant Agreement as a
whole if the other partners fail to find a replacement).
3. A beneficiary becomes subject to EU restrictive measures (or other public law measures
that prohibit the granting authority from providing funding). This means that the beneficiary
is no longer eligible for funding and the granting authority may decide to terminate its
participation (or the Grant Agreement if no other solution can be found).
4. An SME participating as a beneficiary in a grant is acquired by another company.
Following the change of ownership, the beneficiary exceeds the ceilings of the SME
definition and loses its SME status. As one of the awarding conditions to participate in that
mono-beneficiary grant is to be a single start-up or an SME, the change of status calls into
question the decision to award the grant and the Granting Authority decides to terminate
the Grant Agreement.
Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of change of situation that
entails loss of eligibility, e.g. change of ownership, relocation date, etc (see Article 6).
Loss of eligibility may lead to termination by the EU. However, in most cases, the
granting authority will simply ask the consortium to replace the partner by amendment or to
change the partner’s role to associated partner, etc.
▪ Grant Agreement cannot be amended after termination of a beneficiary’s
participation
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if it cannot be
amended after termination of a beneficiary’s participation because the necessary
306EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
changes to the Grant Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of the equal treatment of applicants; see Article 39).
The Grant Agreement may be directly terminated if beneficiary termination
would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
▪ Action can no longer be implemented
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if action
implementation is prevented by force majeure or the action implementation is
suspended and resumption is not possible or the necessary amendment is not
acceptable (see Articles 31 and 39).
Example:
1. A fire devastates premises where most of the technical equipment and computers with
the action’s data are stored. The coordinator suspends the action’s implementation to
rebuild the premises. The granting authority carries out a review after the force majeure
takes place and concludes that the consortium can no longer implement the action. It
therefore decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
2. A beneficiary that has the necessary background to work on the action and owns the
installations where most of the work would be implemented decides to terminate its
participation. The granting authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement because the
remaining consortium cannot continue implementing the action in the same way without
this beneficiary. Continuing the action in a different way then originally evaluated and
ranked would call into question the decision awarding the grant.
▪ Bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors,
suspension of business activities or other similar proceedings
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it is
declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts,
has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities,
or is subject to any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law
(since this normally implies that the beneficiary cannot carry out the work
properly).
Example: A coordinator informs the granting authority that a beneficiary participating in a
Grant Agreement is insolvent. It does not notify beneficiary termination because it thinks
that the beneficiary may continue implementing the action. The granting authority considers
that the beneficiary has not sufficient means to pursue implementation and terminates the
beneficiary’s participation.
Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or
the coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority. Late information will be
considered as a breach of the information obligation under the Grant Agreement (see
Article 19.4).
▪ Non-compliance with tax or social security obligations
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it has
not fulfilled its obligations to pay social security contributions or taxes under
applicable national law (i.e. the law of the country in which it is established and
those of the country(ies) where the action is implemented; see Article 11.1).
Example: A national administration notifies to the granting authority that a beneficiary did
not pay social security contribution for its employees. If this beneficiary cannot prove that it
paid these contributions or clarify the situation within a given deadline, the granting
authority may terminate its participation in the Grant Agreement. If the beneficiary declared
personnel costs including amounts for social security contributions not actually incurred, the
granting authority may furthermore recover any undue amounts.
▪ Grave professional misconduct
307EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
one of its persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or
one of its persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been
found guilty of grave professional misconduct (proven by any means).
‘Grave professional misconduct’ is defined as any type of unacceptable or improper
behaviour in exercising one’s profession, especially by employees, including grave
professional misconduct within the meaning of Article 138(1)(c) of the EU Financial
Regulation 2024/250947 (see Article 2).
According to Article 138(1)(c) of the Financial Regulation, a person or entity is
guilty of grave professional misconduct when it has violated applicable laws or
regulations or ethical standards of the profession to which the person or entity
belongs, or by having engaged in any wrongful conduct which has an impact on its
professional credibility where such conduct denotes wrongful intent or gross
negligence. Therefore, one of the following conditions needs to exist in order for a
conduct to be qualified as grave professional misconduct:
− the entity has violated applicable laws or regulations or ethical standards of
the profession to which it belongs or
− the entity had a wrongful conduct which has an impact on its professional
credibility and the conduct denotes wrongful intent or gross negligence.
The examples given in Article 138(1)(c) FR cover, in particular, violation of ethical
standards of the profession, wrongful conduct with impact on professional
credibility, breach of generally accepted professional ethical standards, false
declarations/misrepresentation of information, participation in a cartel or other
agreement distorting competition, violation of IPR, attempting to influence
decision-making processes by taking advantage, through misrepresentation, of a
conflict of interests, or to obtain confidential information from public authorities to
gain an advantage and incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence or similar
activities contrary to the EU values where negatively affecting or risking to affect
the performance of a legal commitment.
The concept of 'professional misconduct' covers “all wrongful conduct which has an
impact on the professional credibility of the operator at issue and not only the
violations of professional ethical standards in the strict sense of the profession to
which that operator belongs, which are established by the disciplinary body of that
profession or by a judgment which has the force of res judicata"48.
Examples:
1. A legal entity’s participation in a Grant Agreement is terminated when a national
investigation uncovers that it falsified the results of its clinical studies.
2. A non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless of religious or
political background released controversial statements of anti-Semitic nature, in particular
by calling to destroy country X. Expressing the wish to destroy country X was considered a
conduct which has an impact on the integrity and professional credibility of the organisation
and represents a breach of the generally accepted professional ethical standards and of EU
values. The organisation participation in the Grant Agreement was terminated on the
ground of grave professional misconduct.
▪ Fraud, corruption or other criminal activities
47 [old Financial Regulation: Article 136(1)(c) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
48 See Judgment of 13 December 2012, Forpostą SA and ABC Direct Contact sp. z o.o. v Poczta Polska SA, C-
465/11, ECLI:EU:C:2012:801.
308EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
one of its persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or
one of its persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has
committed fraud, corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money
laundering or any other illegal activity.
Example: A legal entity’s participation in several EU projects is terminated when its owner
is convicted by national courts to have participated in large-scale drug trafficking.
▪ Circumvention of fiscal, social or other legal obligations in the country of
origin
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
entities having powers of representation, decision-making or control) was created
under a different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social or other
legal obligations in the country of origin (or one of its persons having powers of
representation, decision-making or control, or one of its persons essential for the
award/implementation of the grant created an entity with this purpose).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement or the participation of
a beneficiary, if a beneficiary (or one of its persons having powers of
representation, decision-making or control, or one of its persons essential for the
award/implementation of the grant) has committed substantial errors,
irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been
properly implemented, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics, values or
security rules, etc) — either during the award procedure or during the action.
Examples:
1. False declarations in the proposal form; coordinator does not transfer payments to the
other beneficiaries, or beneficiaries do not pay their subcontractors; coordinator does not
submit the reports or information (despite a reminder); consortium does not inform the
granting authority about the receipt of a second grant for the same/similar proposal; review
shows that action does not achieve its critical objectives and is way behind schedule and
consortium submits a short-term implementation plan that is not acceptable; audit shows
that beneficiary declared costs based on fake invoices; a check shows that reports
submitted by the consortium were almost entirely copied from the web (plagiarism);
consortium does not submit an amendment request after beneficiary termination
2. A legal entity’s participation in a Grant Agreement is terminated when the granting
authority checks uncovers that the entity made a public speech inciting to hate and
discrimination (breach of obligation to respect EU values in Article 14).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also terminate the Grant Agreement, if a beneficiary
(or one of its person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or one of its person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has
committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of
obligations in other grants, if
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
309EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systematic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that appear intentional and also affect all
other Grant Agreements signed by the audited beneficiary. The granting authority may
terminate the participation of the audited beneficiary in the Grant Agreement.
▪ Non-removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary if it refuses
to remove one of its affiliated entities or an associated partner which is in one of
the following situations:
− bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors,
suspension of business activities or other similar proceedings;
− grave professional misconduct
− non-compliance with tax or social security obligations
− fraud, corruption or other criminal activities
− substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations (in
this grant or other grants).
▪ If provided in the Grant Agreement: the linked action (see Article 3) has not
started as specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can no longer contribute,
and this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement
▪ Depending on the programme and on the type of action, there may be other
specific grounds for termination of the Grant Agreement by the granting
authority, for example:
− major delays (CEF, RENEWFM, JTM)
− loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost scientific or technological relevance.
Example: A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered
material is selected. After the action starts, a European scientific publication
demonstrates that this material contains a chemical substance that irremediably
harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot continue and the granting
authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
− loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its economic relevance
− loss of relevance as being part of a given portfolio (HE-challenge-
based EIC Pathfinder actions and Missions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially
selected.
− change of humanitarian context no longer allows the
implementation of the action (HUMA)
− suspension or termination of the cooperation or of the Financing
Agreement with the partner country in which the project takes
place (RELEX)
− change of partner country policy environment (RELEX).
310EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Before terminating (the Grant Agreement or a beneficiary’s participation), the granting
authority may first suspend the Grant Agreement (see Article 31.2), to try to fix the problems
and re-establish compliance with the Grant Agreement. In this case, it will only terminate
(the Grant Agreement or a beneficiary’s participation) if the action cannot be resumed.
2. Procedure
How? Before GA or beneficiary termination, the granting authority will follow a contradictory
procedure to give the consortium/beneficiary the possibility to submit
observations.Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
Depending on the situation and type of termination, this procedure will be directed either at
the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
− terminations linked to the consortium (e.g. grant termination after a negative project
review): normally the coordinator
− terminations linked to a beneficiary (e.g. beneficiary termination or simultaneous
termination of grants after a beneficiary audit): normally the beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must inform the other beneficiaries, via its
usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc.) and
ask for their comments.
If it is directed at the beneficiary concerned, the granting authority will inform coordinator
later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality).
If a beneficiary is terminated on the basis of Article 32.3.1(e) (i.e. bankruptcy or similar), the
granting authority will also contact the liquidator/administrator (— as soon as possible after
the termination is confirmed).
Information obligation — Beneficiaries should inform their coordinator since beneficiary
termination always has a significant impact on the action (see Article 19), likely requiring a
redistribution of tasks and budget.
3. Effects
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’): Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
The effects of Grant Agreement termination are the same as when the beneficiaries terminate
the Grant Agreement (see Article 32.1.2).
Only costs incurred before termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date;
see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible. Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after
termination are NOT eligible.
Ineligible costs will be rejected. The grant may be reduced, if the termination is based on
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations (for instance if the
action has not been implemented properly; see Article 28). In certain cases, the granting
311EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
authority may also impose administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion and/or financial
penalties; see Article 34).
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action (see Article 32.3.3).
Obligations that continue to apply after GA termination:
▪ Keeping records and other supporting documentation (see Article 20)
▪ Submitting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination)
(see Articles 32.3.3 and 21.2)
▪ Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (e.g.
for checks, reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact;
see Articles 25 and 26)
▪ Complying with the rules on management of intellectual property, background and
results (see Article 16 and Annex 5 > IPR)

SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND
ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS
General > Article 33 — Liability for damages
ARTICLE 33 — LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to third parties as a
consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross negligence.
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the beneficiaries or other
participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement.
1. Liability for damages (of the EU)
When signing the grant, the beneficiaries agree that the granting authority can NOT be held
liable if — in implementing the Grant Agreement — the granting authority (or its
staff/representatives) cause damage to a beneficiary or third party.
Moreover, the granting authority can NOT be held liable if — in implementing the Grant
Agreement — a beneficiary or third party involved in the action causes damage to another
beneficiary or third party.
Examples:
1. An experiment carried out by a beneficiary leads to an accidental escape of pollutants into the
local river.
2. A fire breaks out in a beneficiary’s laboratory in the course of an experiment for the action
conducted during an audit by the granting authority.
Subsidiary (secondary) liability is also excluded.
The granting authority is also not liable for damages caused by other participants involved in
the action (i.e. affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients of
financial support to third parties (FSTP)).
313EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a result of the
implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full compliance with the
Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.
The liability does not extend to indirect or consequential losses or similar damage (such as loss of profit, loss
of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by wilful act or by a breach of
confidentiality.
1. Liability for damages (of the Consortium)
What? If by implementing the action (or by not implementing the action as agreed) a
beneficiary causes damage to the granting authority, intentionally or as a result of gross
negligence, the granting authority may claim compensation.
Examples:
1. Costs of legal proceedings borne by the granting authority.
2. At a meeting on the granting authority’s premises, a beneficiary smokes and causes a fire.
2. Procedure
How? For liability cases, the granting authority will follow the normal procedure for damages
claims (i.e. bringing an action for contractual damages before the EU courts (General Court)).

General > Article 34 — Administrative sanctions and other measures
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as preventing the adoption of administrative sanctions (i.e.
exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public law measures, in addition or
as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to
148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 2988/9546).
46 Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests
(OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1).
1. Administrative sanctions
What? In the framework of the EU Early Detection and Exclusion System (EDES), the
Financial Regulation 2024/2509provides that the competent EU services can take the
following measures:
− exclusion from participation in award procedures and from being selected for
implementing Union funds, when the beneficiary (or a natural or legal person who is a
member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the beneficiary, a
natural person who is essential for the award or for the implementation of the Grant
Agreement, a natural or legal person that assumes unlimited liability for the debts of
the beneficiary) is in one or more of the exclusion situations mentioned in Article 138
of the Financial Regulation49 (e.g. grave professional misconduct, breach of
obligations, fraud, corruption, irregularity, bankruptcy, etc)
− financial penalties, in the cases described in Article 142 of the Financial Regulation50
(e.g. grave professional misconduct, breach of obligations, fraud, irregularity)
− in order to reinforce the deterrent effect of the above measures, publication of the
information related to the case on the Europa website.
These measures are public law measures (not based on the Grant Agreement) and are
conditional on established facts and findings that are substantiated by reliable evidence (e.g.
OLAF reports; EPPO’s investigations; checks, audit or controls of EU services etc).
When there is only a suspicion of risk threatening the EU financial interests and the relevant
facts are not yet established, the case may be registered in the database for information, to
enable further verifications and reinforced monitoring.
Example: The representative of a non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless
of religious or political background released controversial statements of anti-Semitic nature, in
particular by calling to destroy country X. Expressing the wish to destroy country X is considered a
breach of EU values (non-discrimination) and a grave professional misconduct (a conduct which has
an impact on the integrity and professional credibility of the organisation and represents a breach of
the generally accepted professional ethical standards). The organisation was excluded for a specific
duration from participation in award procedures covered by the general budget of the Union.

315EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Procedure
How? Before taking any of the administrative measures above, the competent EU service will
normally follow a contradictory procedure with the person or entity concerned to give them
the possibility to submit observations (— except if it is necessary to preserve the
confidentiality of an investigation or of national judicial proceedings).
316EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
General > Article 35 — Force majeure
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot be considered
in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement,
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control,
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants involved in the
action), and
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without delay, stating
the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force majeure and do
their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.
1. Force majeure
What? In case of force majeure, the parties will be excused from not fulfilling their
obligations (i.e. there will be no breach of obligations under the Grant Agreement and none of
the adverse measures for breach of contract will be applied).
‘Force majeure’ relates to an extraordinary event or situation that is beyond the party’s
control and that prevents it from fulfilling its obligations under the Grant Agreement.
The event or situation must be inevitable (despite the beneficiary’s due diligence, i.e. level of
care that can reasonably be expected from a beneficiary, in order to ensure the fulfilment of
its obligations under the Grant Agreement) and unforeseeable. Force majeure can NOT be
used to justify situations caused by a beneficiary’s negligence, events that could reasonably
have been anticipated or events that are inherent to the normal activity of the beneficiary
(e.g. sick leaves, strikes, technical failure, human errors, etc.).
Examples (force majeure): An earthquake, terrorist attack or volcanic eruption; delay in using
equipment due to floods in the region/country.
Examples (not force majeure): machine malfunctions, robberies; a subcontractor building a test
site goes bankrupt, labour disputes or strikes, financial difficulties, personnel issues, for example
sickness
Usually, force majeure can be evoked ONLY for the immediate impact of the situation. Once
earthquakes, extreme weather events, etc. have taken place and impact on the further
implementation of the action becomes foreseeable, the beneficiaries must adapt their planning,
take mitigation measures and take all other necessary steps to fulfil their obligations under the
Grant Agreement under the new circumstances.
317EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If force majeure entails extra costs for the implementation of the action they may be eligible
but it will normally be the beneficiaries that will have to bear them (since they were not
budgeted in the proposal and the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 cannot be increased).
If a task for the action could not be executed due to a situation of force majeure but certain
costs were incurred for that task and could not have been avoided, those costs may still be
eligible and can be charged to the action.
Example: Airline tickets bought by a beneficiary to attend a meeting related to the action. The
flight is cancelled because the air traffic is suspended due a terrorist threat, and so the beneficiary
cannot travel to the meeting. If the ticket costs fulfil the eligibility conditions set out under Article 6
of the Grant Agreement and it is impossible for the beneficiary to get those costs reimbursed (e.g
by the airline or a travel insurance) then they may be eligible, even if the beneficiary did not travel.
Force majeure may lead to Grant Agreement suspension (see Article 31) or Grant Agreement
termination (see Article 32).
How? The coordinator must immediately formally notify the granting authority (through
Portal Formal Notifications: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification).
The beneficiary concerned must quickly put in place all possible measures to limit the
damage caused by the force majeure, including measures to limit related costs.

CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
General > Article 36 — Communication between the parties
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
[OPTION 1 for eGrants:
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal in accordance with the Portal Terms and
Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if explicitly instructed otherwise by the
granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the Grant Agreement (project number and
acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and Conditions. For
naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated — before the signature of this
Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’. The role and tasks of the LEAR are
stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of sending, as
indicated by the time logs.
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the communication
is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not been accessed within 10 days
after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general principles apply
(i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with proof of delivery will be considered
to have been received either on the delivery date registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection
at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be considered in
breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Adresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is the official
mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.]
[OPTION 2 for paper grants: For grants which are not managed through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(see Data Sheet, Point 1), the specific rules set out in Annex 5 apply.]
1. Communication between the parties — Funding & Tenders Portal electronic
exchange system
319EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
All communications (information, requests, submissions, ‘formal notifications’, etc) between
the consortium and the granting authority — before and after the payment of the balance —
must be in electronic form and done directly inside the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The Funding & Tenders Portal is the European Commission platform for the single electronic
data exchange area for participants (SEDIA) under Article 150(1) of the EU Financial
Regulation 2024/250951.
The Portal offers different functions:
− viewing and changing the legal entity data in the Participant Register
− formal notifications and other actions inside the different grant management
workflows (amendments, reporting, deliverables, etc)
− contacting granting authority outside a workflow (either through the Portal Formal
Notifications Service or Messaging Service)
− where necessary, secured electronic signatures (for instance, for signing the Grant
Agreement, accession to the Grant Agreement, amendments and financial
statements).
It keeps logs of all communication and allows for delivery with proof of receipt.
All communications are recorded in the project file (with date and time). For communications
that trigger deadlines, also the date and time of access are recorded.
The use of Portal secured personalised area (‘My Area’, also called ‘electronic exchange
system’ or ‘Portal Grant Management System’) is subject to the Funding & Tenders Portal
Terms & Conditions.
Access is limited to persons with a user account and authorisation to act for the beneficiary.
For that purpose, all beneficiaries must have appointed a legal entity appointed
representative (LEAR) before signature of the Grant Agreement. Authorisation and access are
linked to user roles (e.g. LEAR, PLSIGN or PFSIGN).
Examples:
1. Only Legal Signatories (PLSIGNs) may sign the Grant Agreement and amendments.
2. Only Financial Statement Signatories (PFSIGNs) may sign the financial statements.
3. Only Primary Coordinator Contacts (PCoCos) and Coordinator Contacts (CoCo) may submit
information to the granting authority. The Primary Coordinator Contact can be changed only by the
responsible (project) officer in the back-office, while the other roles can be managed by the
participants themselves via the Portal. (In case of MSCA-IF the Supervisor identified in the proposal
becomes the PCoCo, in ERC grants the PI identified in the proposal becomes the PCoCo.)
4. Only Participant Contacts (PaCos) may submit information to the coordinator. They cannot
submit information directly to the granting authority.
5. Only the Participant Contact(s) (PaCo, or PCoCo and CoCo(s) in case of the coordinator), Legal
Signatory (PLSIGN) or Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) of the recipient beneficiary may access a
formal notification for the first time (i.e. may formally receive it).
6. Task Managers (TaMa) may only complete and save web forms and upload documents related to
their organisation’s participation in the grant. They cannot submit information to the coordinator or
the granting authority.
7. Team Members (TeMe) have read-only access to project information. They cannot complete or
save forms, nor submit information to the coordinator or the granting authority.
51 [old Financial Regulation: Article 147(1) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
320EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
More details on My Area and access and roles in the Portal are explained in the Online
Manual > My Area.
In principle, all communications from/to the granting authority must normally go via the
coordinator — unless the Grant Agreement or other rules provide for direct communication
with the other beneficiaries (e.g. Articles 21, 25, 26, 39; OLAF Regulations No 883/2013 and
No 2185/2996).
By using the Portal, the communications will automatically fulfil the minimum conditions
set out in the Grant Agreement (i.e. that they must be made in writing and bear the number
of the Grant Agreement (project number and acronym), in order to be on record and
identifiable).
For actions that require a document upload, you should always use the forms and
templates provided on the Portal Reference Documents — unless explicitly instructed
otherwise by the granting authority.
Beneficiaries may receive notifications even after the end of the project (e.g. for audits,
impact evaluations, etc). Therefore they (and in particular their LEARs) are obliged to keep
the contact data up to date, in order to ensure that the communication channels remain
active.
The responsibility for opening notifications in time is with the beneficiaries.
Formal notifications are considered to have been accessed 10 days after they have
been sent (— even if not actually opened by the recipient, e.g. refusal of reception or
omission). Deadlines that are counted from the date of receipt are counted as of day eleven
(see Article 3.3.3 Funding & Tenders Portal Terms & Conditions).
The same is in principle valid for formal notifications after the payment of the balance —
except that the granting authority will check that the notification has actually been
accessed by the beneficiary (at any time, before or after the 10 days deadline). If it was
not accessed, the granting authority will send a second notification, this time on paper by
registered post with proof of delivery. In that case, the deadlines will start to run from the
date of receipt of the second notification.
Specific cases (Portal access rights):
Beneficiaries in bankruptcy — If a beneficiary goes bankrupt during the action, the
liquidator may be granted the necessary access rights in the Portal, in order to complete the
beneficiary’s obligations. If exceptionally necessary, the granting authority can also agree to
communication outside the Portal electronic exchange system (i.e. via registered post or e-
mails).
2. Date of communication
Communications are considered to have been sent on the date and time they are sent
through the electronic exchange system.
Communications are considered to have been received on the date and time they were
accessed. If formal notifications have not been accessed within 10 days after sending, they
will be considered to have been accessed.
Formal communications made on paper, sent by registered post with proof of delivery, are
considered to have been made on either:
− the delivery date registered by the postal service or
− the deadline for collection at the post office.
321EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The sending party cannot be considered in breach of its obligation to comply with a deadline
in case it can demonstrate that the electronic exchange system was unavailable.
3. Addresses
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
If exceptionally, the communication is on paper, the addresses are as follows:
− for communicating to the granting authority: the official mailing address indicated on
its website (or as otherwise indicated in the call)
− for communicating to beneficiaries: the legal address specified in the Portal Participant
Register.

General > Article 38 — Calculation of periods and deadlines
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7147, periods expressed in days, months or years are calculated from
the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
47 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time-limits
(OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
1. Periods in days
A period expressed in days starts on the day following the triggering event and ends at
midnight of the last day of the period.
Days are calendar days (not working days).
Example:
Under Article 21.2 and in accordance with the schedule set out in Point 4.2 of the Data Sheet, the
coordinator (or beneficiaries in mono-beneficiaries grants) must submit a periodic report within 60
days following the end of each reporting period.
The action is divided into the following reporting periods:
RP1: from 1 March 2022 to 31 August 2023
RP2: from 1 September 2023 to 28 February 2024
Therefore, the deadline of 60 days for the first periodic report starts on 1 September 2023 and ends
on 30 October 2023.
The deadline of 60 days for the second and last periodic report starts on 1 March 2024 and ends on
29 of April 2024.
2. Periods in months or years
Periods expressed in months or years end at midnight on the day with the same date as the
day on which the period started, in the last month or year of the period.
Example: Under Article 29, the granting authority may suspend the payment deadline if a request
for payment cannot be processed. The suspension takes effect on the day the granting authority
sends the notification. When the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the
granting authority to confirm if the suspension will continue. The granting authority sent the
notification for a grant payment deadline on 31 July 2023. Therefore, the suspension will have
exceeded two months on 30 September 2023.
If that day does not exist (e.g. 31 of April), the period ends at midnight of the last day of that
month (e.g. 30 of April).
Example: Under Article 25.1.2 and in accordance with the time-limit set out in Point 6 of the Data
Sheet, reviews may be started up to two years after the final payment is made. A grant’s final
payment takes place on 29 February 2023. Therefore, the two-year review period starts on 1 March
2023 and ends on 1 March 2025.

General > Article 39 — Amendments
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would call
into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in the Portal
Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries (see Annex 3). If
a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission must be done by another
beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or proof that this
opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45 days of receiving
notification (or any additional information the granting authority has requested). If it does not agree, it must
formally notify its disagreement within the same deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for
the assessment of the request. If no notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to
have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the amendment.
1. Amendments
What & When? Amendments serve to change the Grant Agreement by mutual consent of
the parties.
They are normally done at the initiative of the consortium, but they may also be initiated by
the granting authority (e.g. where errors need to be corrected; to change Annex 1 after a
review of the action, etc).
They are mandatory for all substantive or important changes to the Grant Agreement, e.g.
changes impacting the project outcome, changes that affect the description of the action in
Annex 1, etc.
325EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The general terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement that apply to all EU grants
can NOT be changed via an amendment. Only project-specific data (e.g. duration of the
reporting periods, starting date, etc.) and the options in the Grant Agreement are open to
amendments.
Moreover, amendments may NOT result in changes that — if they had been known before
awarding the grant — would have had an impact on the award decision. Those are mostly
changes that:
− involve the consortium composition and have an impact on the eligibility criteria set
out in the call conditions (e.g. minimum number or types of participants in a proposal)
− involve changes to the action and/or its budget and affect the award criteria
announced in the call conditions (e.g. the tasks in Annex 1 are changed so
substantially that the action no longer corresponds to the scope of the call for
proposals)
− breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
− do not comply with the applicable rules (e.g. Financial Regulation 2024/2509) or with
provisions of the Grant Agreement itself (e.g. amendment to subcontract tasks of the
coordinator).
Characteristics of amendments:
▪ Can only be done in writing — a verbal agreement is not binding on the parties
since EU granting authorities are bound to written format52.
▪ Enters into force after the signature by the coordinator and the granting authority
through an exchange of signatures.
▪ Takes effect on the date agreed by the parties (retroactive or in the future); if no
date is specified, on the date when the second party approves it (not retroactive).
▪ Are usually available only during the action (i.e. after the entry into force of the
Grant Agreement and before the final payment).
▪ Must normally be requested before the end of the project; in exceptional cases
amendment clauses are also open after the end of the project (e.g. change of
coordinator or change of coordinator’s bank account, in order to be able to make
the final payment).
▪ Has to be signed by persons having the same capacity to represent the legal entity
as those who signed the initial Grant Agreement.
▪ Leaves all the other provisions of the Grant Agreement which are not affected
unchanged and with continued full effect.
▪ Forms an integral part of the Grant Agreement.
▪ Has to be in line with the rules applicable to the Grant Agreement (including
applicable EU, international and national law, where relevant under the
Agreement).
52 See Article 204(1) Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 201(1) Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
326EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Cannot have the purpose or effect of making changes to the Grant Agreement
which might call into question the decision awarding the grant or result in unequal
treatment of beneficiaries or applicants.
From a strictly legal perspective, amendments are necessary whenever there is a need to
change the Grant Agreement (including changes to its Annexes).
The amendment clauses that are available in the Portal Amendment tool are called ‘AT
clauses’.
Example: If an affiliated entity ends its participation, the option in Article 8 and the Data Sheet
must be updated to set its ‘termination date’. This can be done by using amendment clause AT6.
If such changes affect the implementation of the action and require an amendment, the
granting authority will examine the situation and inform the coordinator.
Examples (change that requires an amendment):
1. Beneficiary A becomes bankrupt. It will be necessary terminate its participation and to amend
the Grant Agreement.
2. Beneficiary B moves from Europe to Australia during the action. The change of address implies
that the beneficiary becomes ineligible for funding, so the Grant Agreement will have to be
amended to terminate participation or change role to associated partner.
Example (change that does NOT require an amendment): Beneficiary D changes its name.
The update in the Portal Participant Register is sufficient; no amendment is needed.
Information obligation — Changes in the name, address, legal form and organisation type
AND changes in the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation may or may
not require an amendment (see below) — but they ALL trigger the information obligation under
Article 19.3.
Changes without any impact on the Grant Agreement normally do NOT necessarily require a
formal amendment. They are therefore sometimes done by information procedure,
sometimes by formal amendment (if simpler because an automated clause is available).
Sample list (non-exhaustive) of cases where an amendment is necessary:
▪ Addition of a new beneficiary (AT1; see Article 40.2)
What? Addition of a new beneficiary during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The new beneficiary must first register (and get validated) in the Portal Participant
Register — unless it already has a validated participant identification code (PIC).
The beneficiary’s name (and their entry date) will be updated in the Preamble and the
list of participants in the Data Sheet and the beneficiary will be entitled to submit costs
as from that date.
For the entry date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the date of signature of the Accession Form OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment.
Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the
entry date (of the new beneficiary) may be set before the termination date (of the
beneficiary that is replaced) — so that both can incur costs for a certain period.
Example: The former beneficiary ends its participation on 01.06.2021, and the new beneficiary
accedes to the Grant Agreement on 01.05.2021.
Combinations
327EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
If the new beneficiary is participating with affiliated entities/associated partners, they
will also have to be added (with effect from the same date) (AT2, AT3).
For international organisations a change of the applicable law/dispute settlement
options may be needed (AT16, AT17).
▪ Addition of an affiliated entity/associated partner (AT2, AT3; see Article 8 and
9.1)
What? Addition of a new affiliated entity/associated partner during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The new affiliated entity/associated partner must first register (and, for affiliated
entities, also get validated) in the Portal Participant Register — unless it already has a
participant identification code (PIC).
The affiliated entity/associated partner name (and their entry date) will be updated in
the list of participants in the Data Sheet and Article 8/9.1.
For the entry date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date OR the accession date
of the beneficiary OR the date of entry into force of the amendment.
If the affiliated entity/associated partner joins the action at the same time as the
beneficiary they are linked to, the starting date of participation must be the same as the
date of the new beneficiary.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
▪ Beneficiary termination (AT4; see Article 32.2)
What? Removal of a beneficiary during the action.
There is NO need to request an amendment if termination takes effect after the end of
the action (see Article 4) — unless the beneficiary concerned is the coordinator AND the
amendment is necessary for submitting the reports and distributing the payments.
There is NO more need for a separate termination notification (simplification; new for
2021-2027).
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The beneficiary’s name (and their exit and termination dates) will be updated in the
Preamble and the list of participants in the Data Sheet. The beneficiary will be entitled
to submit costs until that date.
For the exit date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the day after submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force
of the amendment.
The exit date should be the date the participant stops (or stopped) working on the
action (i.e. end of cost eligibility date).
328EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For the termination date, the choice is between a fixed date (future) after the
submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment, whichever is the latest. It is normally predefined by the exit date and
automatically fixed by the IT system.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
If the beneficiary was participating with affiliated entities/associated partners, they will
also have to be removed (with effect from the same date) (AT6, AT7).
If the coordinator is removed, the amendment will also have to propose a new
coordinator and coordinator bank account (AT11, AT12).
▪ Removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner (AT6, AT7; see Article 8 and
9.1)
What? Removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
If requested by the granting authority (e.g. because of audit results or an OLAF
investigation), the consortium MUST submit an amendment to remove an affiliated
entity/associated partner. If the consortium does not follow-up this request, the
beneficiary can be terminated by the granting authority (which will also remove the
affiliated entity/associated partner).
The name of the affiliated entity/associated partner (and their exit and termination
dates) will be updated in the list of participants in the Data Sheet and Article 8/9.1.
For the exit date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the day after submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force
of the amendment.
For the termination date, the choice is between a fixed date (future) after the
submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment, whichever is the latest. It is normally predefined by the exit date and
automatically fixed by the IT system.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
▪ Change of coordinator (AT11)
What? Replacement of the coordinator during the action (e.g. because of financial
difficulties).
This amendment clause usually remains open even after the end of the action — until
the final payment is paid out.
What not? There is NO need to request an amendment if there is only a change in the
person in charge of the coordination of the project (since the person’s name is not
mentioned in the Grant Agreement).
Information obligation — In this case you should however inform the granting
authority (see Article 19).
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
329EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The new coordinator becomes beneficiary No 1 in the Preamble and list of participants
in the Data Sheet and the handover date is added to the coordinator list in the Data
Sheet.
For the handover date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or
future) OR the date of entry into force of the amendment.
The handover date should be the date when the new coordinator takes over (and the
former coordinator stops acting as coordinator).
If there was a gap (former coordinator leaves before new coordinator starts; e.g.
coordinator is in bankruptcy) this will be visible in the coordinator list, since the handover
date for the former coordinator (when it stopped doing coordinator tasks) must be at the
latest its termination date.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
The coordinator bank account will have to be changed (AT12).
If the new coordinator is not already a beneficiary of the Grant Agreement, it must
first accede to the Grant Agreement as a new beneficiary (AT1).
If the former coordinator would like to leave, its participation will have to be
terminated (AT4).
▪ Change of the coordinator’s bank account for payments (AT12)
What? An amendment is necessary for all events that imply a change of the account
number/IBAN code indicated in the Grant Agreement (see Data Sheet, Point 4).
What not? NO amendment is necessary for a change of the name of the bank or name
of the account holder; a change of the bank account data (and validation) in the Portal
Participant Register is sufficient.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The bank account data must first be updated in the Portal Participant Register (and be
validated).
▪ Changes to Annex 1 (description of the action) (AT21)
What? Changes to the description of the action, in particular:
− significant change of the action tasks (e.g. if tasks are added/removed) or of
their division among the beneficiaries
Significant changes to the action such as removal of action tasks may put into
question the decision to award the grant. The granting authority will assess on a
case-by-case basis whether such changes are permissible.
− changes concerning eligible in-kind contributions provided by third parties free
of charge (HE) or subcontracts
Such changes could in principle also be made via simplified approval procedure
(see Articles 9.2 and 9.3); however, if the beneficiary requests an amendment,
it will immediately know if the granting authority agrees (or not). Without
amendment, this decision is left for later and the granting authority may reject
the costs as ineligible at the moment of the payment.
330EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− changes concerning the tasks to be carried out by affiliated entities and related
costs (including if an affiliated entity is removed)
− changes concerning Grant Agreement options (options are removed or added)
− significant changes concerning deliverables (e.g. adding/removing deliverables;
changes in substance of a project output which is reflected in a deliverable,
etc.).
What not? Changes to the due date of a deliverable normally do not require an
amendment.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Combinations
Annex 2 may have to be changed (AT41).
▪ Change of the starting date, project duration or reporting periods (AT24,
AT25, AT26)
What? Change of the action’s schedule (starting date, action duration or reporting
periods).
Example: The Grant Agreement for the action has a fixed starting date that is before the
date on which the Grant Agreement enters into force. Because of weather conditions, the
consortium cannot start on that date and requests the granting authority to change it.
Even if the action is prolonged, the maximum grant amount will NOT be increased.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Extensions should be requested before the action ends and must be specifically
justified.
Combinations
Annex 1 may have to be changed (AT21).
Depending on the case all three clauses may have to be used (AT24, AT25 and AT26).
▪ Changes to Annex 2 (estimated budget) and Annex 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, if
necessary (AT41, AT51, AT51a, 51b, 51c, 51d)
What? Changes to the estimated budget, in particular:
− a budget transfer between beneficiaries or between budget categories (or both)
which is linked to a significant change in the action’s work (i.e. Annex 1);
including new subcontracts (for HE, also new eligible in-kind contributions)
− a budget transfer to a form of costs that was not used by the beneficiary (i.e.
with 0 EUR costs in Annex 2) — except for transfer of amounts to budget
categories which are based on unit costs or unit contributions calculated using
the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary (e.g. budget category D.2
Internal invoices)
− a budget transfer to or from the budget category for volunteers (for
programmes with eligible costs for volunteers: ERDF-TA, LIFE, ERASMUS,
CREA, CERV, JUST, ESF/SOCPL, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
− a budget transfer to or from to budget categories based on lump sum costs or
lump sum contributions
331EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What not? There is NO need to request an amendment for changes covered by the
budget flexibility rule in Article 5.5.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Best practice: If Annex 2b or other specific cost annexes need to be changed, the
beneficiaries should contact the granting authority.
Combinations
Annex 1 may have to be changed (AT21).
2. Procedure
How? Amendment requests must be prepared by the requesting party (i.e. usually the
coordinator) directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
Best practice: In case of doubt or if none of the available amendment clauses fit,
beneficiaries should contact the granting authority, to discuss the amendment.
For the addition of new partners, the new entities (beneficiaries, affiliated entities or
associated partners) must have been registered (and beneficiaries and affiliated entities also
validated) in the Participant Register.
Examples:
1. A new beneficiary must be validated (legal entity validation). This means that the new beneficiary will have
to register in the Portal Participant Register, be validated and appoint a LEAR.
2. Validation of the new bank account, to change the bank account.
The request must be unambiguous and complete and submitted in time (i.e. sufficiently in
advance to allow proper analysis and preparation before it is due to take effect and —
generally — before the end of the action; see Article 4). Requests introduced AFTER the end
of the action will be accepted only exceptionally, for very specific and duly substantiated
cases (e.g. change of bank account, change of coordinator to make the final payment).
The coordinator must ensure that they have the agreement of the consortium (in accordance
with the internal decision-making processes, e.g. unanimity, simple or qualified majority, etc
set out in the consortium agreement; where applicable).
Once completed, the request (with all its uploaded supporting documents) must be
submitted and signed by the PLSIGN of the coordinator (on behalf of the other
beneficiaries, on the basis of the mandate given in the accession forms).
Pending amendment requests may at any moment be withdrawn (before they have been
accepted or formally rejected).
Example: The coordinator requests an amendment to change its bank account number and the
reallocation of tasks in Annex 1 and of budget in Annex 2. Since the change of bank account is
urgent because the Commission has to make the interim payment and the revision of the Annexes
may require more time, the coordinator withdraws the request and makes a new request to change
only the bank account and a second one to change the Annexes.
A request containing several changes to the Grant Agreement will be considered as one (and
must either be agreed or rejected by the other party as a whole).
If the receiving party requests additional information/documents, a new deadline will apply,
i.e. 45 days from receiving the additional information/documents.
Example: The coordinator submits a request to add a new beneficiary with several affiliated
entities (see Article 8). The granting authority requests a signed declaration for the joint and
several liability of the affiliated entities (Annex 3a). A new 45-day deadline for evaluation and
validation will apply from the moment the granting authority receives the declaration.
The other party must — within 45 days — agree or disagree.
332EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The deadline may exceptionally be extended by the receiving party, for a period to be
determined case-by-case and if necessary for the assessment of the request (e.g. a review is
needed to assess the changes).
If accepted it will be counter-signed by the receiving party directly in the Portal Amendment
tool (for the consortium: by the PLSIGN of the coordinator).
If there is no reaction within the deadline, the request is in principle considered to have been
rejected (there is NO tacit approval of amendments). A new amendment request may
however be submitted — even if it fully or partly repeats the initial request.
3. Effects
The amendment enters into force and is binding from the moment the receiving party has
agreed to it (i.e. signed in the Portal Amendment tool).
The amendment will take effect (i.e. the changes to the Grant Agreement will start to apply)
either:
− on the day of its entry into force (i.e. day of the last signature of the amendment) or
− on the specific date(s) indicated (and agreed) in the amendment.
The date should normally be after the entry into force of the amendment. In justified cases it
may — exceptionally — be before (retroactivity of the amendment). In some cases, the Grant
Agreement itself provides for retroactivity.
Examples (retroactivity allowed/foreseen in the GA):
1. Where a new beneficiary is added to the Grant Agreement (AT3), it must assume the rights and
obligations from the accession date specified in the Accession Form. If this date is before the entry
into force of the amendment, this retroactivity implies that its costs will be considered eligible as
from the accession date (and not as from the entry into force of the amendment).
2. Following a suspension of the implementation of the action by the beneficiary or by the
Commission, the suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the
amendment (AT26). This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force
(see Article 31.2.2).
3. If the amendment intends to correct an error (AT60), the change will be made with effect from
entry into force of the Grant Agreement (i.e. from the beginning).
Depending on the amendment clause, the date of taking effect may have an impact on the
eligibility of costs.
Amendment request involving several changes, may take effect on different dates.
Example: On 1 May 2022, the coordinator requests an amendment to change the bank account
and to add a new beneficiary. The addition of the beneficiary takes effect from the date of its
accession, as specified in the Accession Form (1 April 2022), while the change of bank account
takes effect on a date agreed by the parties or on the date on which the amendment enters into
force (e.g. 10 June 2022, the day it is signed by the receiving party).
Specific cases (amendments):
Budget transfers — Only the budget transfers that imply a change of Annex 2 (or one of its
Annexes 2a-2e) require an amendment. Other transfers are covered by the budget flexibility
principle and normally do NOT need an amendment (see Article 5.5).
Examples (no need for amendment):
1. During the action implementation, a beneficiary that declared its direct personnel costs as actual
costs decides to change this and instead to declare them as unit costs in accordance with its usual
accounting practices (average personnel costs), which is allowed in its Grant Agreement.
2. An SME joins an on-going GA. The SME owner does not have a salary but incorrectly budgets its
costs as actual personnel costs (category A.1). She realises the mistake and then switches to the
unit costs for SME owners (category A.4); which is allowed in her Grant Agreement.
333EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Change of name, address or other legal entity data (of beneficiaries/affiliated
entities) — Changes to participant legal data normally do NOT require an amendment.
Simple changes of name, legal form (e.g. Ltd., S.A.), official registration number, address,
VAT number do NOT require an amendment. An update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR
(and validation) in the Portal Participant Register is normally sufficient.
If (exceptionally) the granting authority considers that the registered change affects the
implementation of the action, it will inform the coordinator (and instruct them to request an
amendment, if needed).
Example: Company R moves from Europe to Australia and this implies that the beneficiary is no
longer eligible for EU funding. In such a case, the coordinator will be asked to make an amendment
to the Grant Agreement to exchange the beneficiary or to change its role into ‘associated partner’.
Short names have no legal value and only serve as easy identifiers in the Grant Agreement.
If needed, they can be changed through an amendment (AT15).
A change of the person that represents the coordinator for the purposes of signing the Grant
Agreement requires NO follow-up at all (not even a change in the Portal Participant Register
— since the contact information there is only relevant at the moment of Grant Agreement
signature (not afterwards).
Beneficiary termination due to non-accession — The amendment will have ex tunc effect
(as from the beginning of the action and Preamble, list of participants in the Data Sheet and
Article 8 and 9.1 will be adapted to reflect that the beneficiary (and its affiliated
entities/associated partners) had never joined.
Change of roles — Participant changes that involve the switching of roles are now all done
through so-called ‘in/out amendments’ (new for 2021-2027). Meaning that the entity ends its
participation with one role and starts a new participation with another role.
Be aware that there may be timing restrictions which you may have to respect in that
case (e.g. exit date in one role must be before starting date in another role).
In case of loss of eligibility (and if participation is still allowed), partners may be forced to
switch roles (e.g. from beneficiary/affiliated entity to associated partner).
Example: Beneficiary R moves from Europe to Australia and becomes no longer eligible for
receiving EU funding under the programme. Since participants must comply with the eligibility
conditions throughout the duration of the action, the Grant Agreement must be amended to change
the beneficiary or change its role to associated partner. If R is participating with an affiliated entity
M established in France, M will continue being eligible for funding, but would have to change role to
participate as beneficiary.
Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility (see Article
6). That date should therefore be used as exit date.
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — After the end of
the action, if the coordinator can continue its participation with the bank account of the
administrator/liquidator (i.e. termination and coordinator change not really needed), it will be
exceptionally sufficient to just change the bank account for payments (AT12) without
changing the coordinator.
If the coordinator ceased business operations and will not be able to continue participating in
the project, a coordinator change amendment will be needed. If the coordinator is no longer
able to submit the request for amendment (e.g. because the LEAR and all personnel with
access rights in the Portal IT tools left), the same procedure as for coordinator change
without its agreement should be used (see below).
Termination of the coordinator without their agreement — If the consortium
terminates the coordinator without its agreement, it must provide proof of its decision to
334EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
change the coordinator and nominate one of the beneficiaries to act on its behalf to request
the amendment (see Article 32 and below). Contact the EU project officer in charge of your
grant.
Partial takeovers (PTROs) — Partial takeovers (like all other transfers) are now also
handled as normal in/out amendments (there are no more special all-in-one amendment
clauses for transfers). The former participants will therefore have to submit a termination
report and their participation will be formally closed.
In view of the special status of partial takeovers, the accession forms for new beneficiaries
include a clause on joint and several liability for undue amounts paid to the beneficiary they
replace (i.e. recoveries).
Partial takeovers are transfers of a business unit as a going concern (i.e. transfers that go
beyond the simple sale of assets where a part of the business of the beneficiary — including
the Grant Agreement — is taken over by (one or more) other entity(ies), e.g. partial
acquisition, distribution of a business unit after dissolution/liquidation, division/demerger,
etc).
Partial transfers are generally very complex and their effects depend on the specific
circumstances of each case and grant contract and often also on national law.
Depending on whether the initial entity disappears or continues, there are different types of
partial takeovers:
− Partial acquisition — the original entity continues to exist, but a new entity purchases
a department, business unit, or similar (and absorbs or takes over part of the rights
and obligations of the original entity).
Thus, some of the rights and obligations (and contracts) of the original entity are
transferred to the new entity. Since the beneficiary continues to exist as a legal entity
and only some of its rights and obligations are affected, a case-by-case analysis is
needed (and an amendment therefore necessary).
Example: Company X sells its mobile phone division to company Z; all grants where the mobile
phone division of X was involved will be affected by the transfer of rights and obligations; other
grants where other divisions of company X work will not be affected.
− Distribution of a business unit on dissolution/liquidation — the original entity
disappears (due to dissolution or liquidation), but (one or more) new entities purchase
a department, business unit or similar (and absorb or take over part of its rights and
obligations).
Since only some of the beneficiary’s rights and obligations are transferred, a case-by-
case analysis is needed (and an amendment therefore necessary).
− Division/demerger — the original entity disappears and several entities replace it;
different parts of the original entity are transferred to the new entities (i.e. several
partial transfers to different entities).
Examples:
1. Company X has several ongoing grants. Company X is bought by two other companies (Y &
Z), one of which will absorb the mobile phone division and the other the remaining divisions.
For some grants there will be a transfer of rights and obligations from X to Y, for other grants it
will be from X to Z.
2. Company Ω has an ongoing grant (covering some action tasks to be implemented by its
engineering division and some action tasks to be implemented by other divisions). Company Ω
is bought by two other companies (E and O), one of which absorbs the engineering division and
the other the remaining divisions. There are two partial takeovers: one to company E and one
to company O.
335EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the in/out amendment is due to a partial transfer, this should be clearly mentioned in the
amendment request (together with a copy of the takeover contract, a short summary of the
facts, timeline and effects of the takeover under the applicable national law and a list of the
relevant provisions with references and hyperlinks to the texts.
Universal takeovers — Transfers of the Grant Agreement linked to a universal takeover
normally do NOT require an amendment; an update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR (and
validation) in the Portal Participant Register is sufficient.
Universal takeovers are transfers where the original entity is replaced by one new entity and
all the rights and obligations — including the Grant Agreement — are transferred to this new
entity (e.g. merger or full acquisition).
Example: Beneficiary X merges with another existing entity Y by:
− becoming part of it (thus X and Y are together known as ‘Y’, and entity X ceases to exist) or
− establishing a new separate legal entity (X and Y are together known as ‘Z’).
If (exceptionally) the granting authority considers that the registered transfer affects the
action implementation, it will inform the coordinator (and instruct it to request an
amendment, if needed).
Example:
1. The legal form or type of organisation of the new entity differs from that of the former
beneficiary or affiliated entity and this has an impact on the implementation of the action.
2. The coordinator transfers all its rights and obligations to another legal entity. If this involves a
change of the bank account number in Data Sheet, each Grant Agreement in which it participates
as coordinator must be amended to update this information (AT12).
Information obligation — In case of a universal takeover, the beneficiary must — in
addition to updating the data in the Portal Participant Register— inform the coordinator via its
usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc) under
Article 19.
If a potential planned universal takeover could significantly affect or delay the implementation
of the action, the EU financial interests, the decision to award the grant or the compliance with
the Grant Agreement, the coordinator should flag this as soon as possible the granting
authority. The same applies if the universal takeover concerns an affiliated entity.

General > Article 40 — Accession and addition of new beneficiaries
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession form (see
Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry into force of the
Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of its entry into
force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must — within 30
days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and make any changes necessary
to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate
the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 39. It must
include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal Amendment
tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
1. Accession of beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
All beneficiaries (except the coordinator) must accede to the Grant Agreement by signing the
accession form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal. They must do this within 30 days after
the Grant Agreement enters into force (see Article 44). With the signature of this form, they
will assume the rights and be bound by the obligations under the Agreement with effect from
the date of its entry into force (retroactive).
Before being able to sign the accession form, each beneficiary will have to have provided
their declaration of honour (DoH) and those for its affiliated entities.
In addition, where required by the granting authority during grant preparation, the
beneficiaries concerned will have to have provided their declarations on joint and several
liability (see Annex 3a).
Affiliated entities or associated partners do not become parties to the Grant Agreement and
therefore do NOT need to sign an accession form.
The coordinator is NOT obliged to distribute hard copies of the Grant Agreement and
Accession Form to the other beneficiaries. All documents are available in the project file on
the Portal.
2. Addition of new beneficiaries (amendment)
What? In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request adding a new beneficiary.
337EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The new beneficiary must comply with the eligibility criteria of the call conditions, have
sufficient operational and financial capacity to perform the proposed tasks, comply with the
non-exclusion criteria and commit to implement the action under the same terms and
conditions as the other beneficiaries.
Mono-beneficiary grants can become multi-beneficiary grants, by addition of a new
beneficiary (new for 2021-2027).
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39).
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary.
Before, the new beneficiary must have taken all necessary steps to be able to participate as
beneficiary, i.e. register in the Participant Register and be validated — unless it already has a
validated participant identification code (PIC), provide his declaration on honour, provide a
declaration on joint and several liability of its affiliated entity (if required by the granting
authority), etc.
Effects:
The accession form must specify the accession date. It must be either:
− the date of signature of the accession form
− the date of entry into force of the amendment
OR
− a fixed date:
− either retroactive (i.e. before signature of the accession form)
OR
− future (i.e. after signature of the accession form — this should be an
exceptional case with a justification).
Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the
accession date may be set before the termination date (of the beneficiary that is replaced) —
so that both can incur costs for a certain period.

General > Article 41 — GA transfer
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the grant to a new
beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal Amendment
tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
1. GA transfers
What? In justified cases, mono-beneficiary grants may be transferred to a new beneficiary,
provided that certain conditions are complied with. Article 41 does not apply to multi-
beneficiary actions.
NO transfer can be conducted before the amendment has been accepted by the granting
authority. Transfers without a formal amendment are void and may result in grant
termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible until the granting authority has
approved the amendment.
‘Transfer’ means that the rights and obligations under the Grant Agreement are transferred
from the current beneficiary to a new beneficiary — without passing via termination (Article
32) or addition of a new beneficiary (Article 40.2).
The transfer may NOT call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants. The new beneficiary must comply with the
eligibility criteria of the call conditions, have sufficient operational and financial capacity to
perform the proposed tasks and commit to implement the action under the same terms and
conditions as the former beneficiary.
Example: The transfer will not be accepted if the new beneficiary does not fulfil the eligibility
conditions or does not have sufficient financial and operational capacity.
How? The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the
granting authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why. If the contracting authority considers that the reasons provided do
not justify the transfer, it may reject the request
339EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the accession form in Annex 3 (i.e. the statement to take over all rights and
obligations under the Grant Agreement) of the new beneficiary (signed directly in the
Portal)
− any other supporting documents required by the granting authority.
Effects:
If the request for the transfer of the Grant Agreement to a new beneficiary is accepted by the
granting authority, the Agreement will be amended to introduce the necessary changes and
the new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations thereof.
The transfer will take effect on the day of accession specified in the accession form (see
Annex 3).

ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE GRANTING
AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting authority to any third
party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority on the basis of a reasoned, written
request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed, the assignment
will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations towards the granting
authority.
1. Assignment of claims for payment
What? The beneficiaries may assign (i.e. transfer, sell or give) claims for payment (for work
carried out under the action) to a third party, if the granting authority has explicitly approved
it in writing and on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator.
Assignment has NO effect on the beneficiary’s obligations under the Grant Agreement; it
remains fully bound by them.
‘Assignments of rights’ are limited to claims for payment under Article 22.1. Transfers of
other rights or obligations (e.g. replacement of a beneficiary by the entity that bought it) are
governed by other provisions (e.g. amendments; see Article 39).
Only actual (i.e. existing) claims for payment may be assigned (including pre-financing).
Assignment is NOT possible for future claims.
How? Assignment of payment claims must be requested to the granting authority.
The request for approval must come from the coordinator, on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned. It must be in writing and must explain the reasons for the assignment.
The granting authority will assess the reasons given and approve or reject the request in
writing. In case the granting authority does not approve the assignment or if the terms of it
are not observed, the assignment will have no effect.
Examples (reasonable requests for assignment):
1. Assignment of a claim for payment for work carried out by a research laboratory sold after the
end of the action (but before payment of the balance) by a beneficiary to another legal entity.
2. Assignment for the benefit of creditors in a bankruptcy procedure.
If the assignment is linked to bankruptcy, the approval will also be subject to compliance with
national law.

43.2 Dispute settlement
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties must bring action
before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice — under Article 272 of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of Brussels, Belgium —
unless an association agreement to the EU programme provides for the enforceability of EU court
judgements under Article 272 TFEU.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet, Point 5), the
dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in accordance with the Rules for
Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under Article 299 TFEU
(see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the General Court — or, on appeal, the
Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions against offsetting
and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European Commission (not against the granting
authority; see also Article 22).
1. Dispute settlement
As a general rule, the Grant Agreements contain an Article 272 TFEU arbitration clause —
referring contractual disputes (i.e. disputes on the interpretation, application or validity of the
Grant Agreement) to the EU Courts (General Court).
An Article 272 action is ONLY possible once the granting authority position is final (i.e.
against confirmation letters, debit notes, etc.; NOT against audit reports, audit letters, pre-
information letters, etc).
Bringing an action against the granting authority:
− for grants signed by the European Commission: actions must be brought against the
Commission
− for grants signed by an EU executive agency or other EU body: actions must be brought
against the Agency or EU body.
For disputes of public law nature (i.e. which concern administrative sanctions, offsetting or
enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU; see Articles 22 and 34) actions must be
brought before the EU courts (General Court) under Article 263 TFEU (NOT before any other
court and NOT under Article 272).
Public law measures must ALWAYS be brought to the European Court of Justice under Article
263 TFEU (including actions brought by non-EU beneficiaries).
All procedures are organised in a way that the beneficiaries will always be informed about
what they can do if they disagree (means of redress information in the letters).
Specific cases (dispute settlement):
344EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Non-EU beneficiaries — Contractual disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium. The only exception concerns non-EU beneficiaries which are for the
purpose of the action considered to be established in an associated country and where the
corresponding association agreement to the EU programme provides for the enforceability of
EU court judgments under Article 272 TFEU. In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must
bring the contractual dispute before the EU courts (General Court).
International organisations (IOs) — Are the only types of beneficiaries that can make use
of arbitration in EU grants, as a special means of disputes settlement (provided that the
option is activated in the Grant Agreement; see Data sheet).
Thus, for international organisations, contractual disputes are referred to the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (instead of the EU General Court) and EU granting authorities will
normally avoid adopting public law measures, such as enforceable decisions under Article 299
TFEU or decisions on administrative sanctions (see Article 34). Offsetting remains possible
also against international organisations (as contractual measure, see Article 22.4).

CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY (— ARTICLE 13)
[OPTION for programmes with security requirements: Sensitive information with security
recommendation
Sensitive information with a security recommendation must comply with the additional requirements
imposed by the granting authority.
Before starting the action tasks concerned, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals or other
mandatory documents needed for implementing the task. The documents must be kept on file and be
submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting authority. If they are not in English, they must be
submitted together with an English summary.
For requirements restricting disclosure or dissemination, the information must be handled in accordance with
the recommendation and may be disclosed or disseminated only after written approval from the granting
authority.]
[OPTION for programmes with EU classified information (standard): EU classified information
If EU classified information is used or generated by the action, it must be treated in accordance with the
security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter (SAL) set out in Annex 1 and Decision
2015/44449 and its implementing rules — until it is declassified.
Deliverables which contain EU classified information must be submitted according to special procedures
agreed with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving EU classified information may be subcontracted only with prior explicit written
approval from the granting authority and only to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU
country with a security of information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission).
EU classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants involved in the
action implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the granting authority.]
49 Commission Decision 2015/444/EC, Euratom of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU classified information (OJ L 72,
17.3.2015, p. 53).
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on confidentiality and security (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, EMFAF,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
Some programmes with calls that may involve sensitive or classified information (HE, DEP,
CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM) also have specific provisions on confidentiality and
security in Annex 5.
They cover sensitive information with security recommendations and EU classified
information.
347EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Sensitive information with a security recommendation (HE)
For these programmes, proposals may have to undergo a security review before selection
and may, if there are security issues, be made subject to specific security recommendations.
Examples (security issues): information on gaps and vulnerabilities in existing systems or
critical infrastructures, design, characteristics and requirements of devices used in detection, law-
enforcement measures to counter terrorism, tools and methodologies for predicting and detecting
organised criminal activities, etc.
Examples (security recommendations): classification, limited dissemination, establishment
of a security advisory board, appointment of a project security officer, limiting the level of detail,
using a fake scenario, etc.
Sensitive information concerning commercial secrets, know-how, etc are NOT sensitive
information within the meaning of Annex 5. Commercially sensitive information is already
protected under Article 13.1.
The most common security recommendations concern restricted disclosure or limited
dissemination. This leads to the creation of deliverables, which are sensitive information with
security recommendation. They are listed in Annex 1 (DoA, security section). If this is the
case, third parties should have no access them. Thus, before disclosure or dissemination to a
third party, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator, who must request written approval
from the granting authority. Other security recommendations concern the appointment of
security staff (security officers, security advisory board), specific measures for access to IT
systems, etc.
Some security requirements must be taken care of before grant signature, but most are for
implementation during the grant.
In addition, beneficiaries must obtain — before the start of the action task for which they are
needed — all the necessary security approvals, opinions, notifications and authorisations
(e.g. to security committees, etc). These documents do not need to be submitted, but must
be kept on file and provided on request (e.g. in case of security checks or audits). They must
be able to show that the opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the tasks to be
undertaken in the context of the action. If the documents are not in English, they may be
asked to provide an English summary.
Best practice: When preparing the applications for approvals/opinions/notifications/
authorisations, you should request the assistance of security experts, security
departments/committees and of your organisation’s data protection officer, if relevant.
In case of changes to the security situation, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator,
which must immediately inform the granting authority and, if necessary, request for Annex 1
to be amended.
The granting authority may carry out security checks or audits, to ensure that the
beneficiaries have properly implemented the security requirements and obtained the
opinions/notifications/authorisations (see Article 25).
3. EU classified information (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
Projects with EU classified information will moreover have to comply with the provisions
linked to EU classified information (see Article 13.2).
The project will have to follow a security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter
(SAL) which set out the classification-level and the measures that need to be taken to protect
the information. Both need to be added to Annex 1.
348EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Only entities listed in the security section of Annex 1 can have access to EU classified
information used or generated by the project. Before disclosure or dissemination to a third
party (including other participants involved in the action), the beneficiaries must inform the
coordinator, which must request written approval from the granting authority.
In case of changes to the security situation, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator,
which must immediately inform the granting authority and, if necessary, request for Annex 1
to be amended.
Deliverables containing EU classified information must be submitted following the special
procedure agreed with the granting authority, as described in the programme security
instruction (PSI) (e.g. HE PSI, DEP PSI, EDF PSI, ASAP PSI).
Action tasks involving EU classified information may ONLY be subcontracted (cumulative
conditions):
− to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission) and
− if the granting authority has explicitly approved such requests in writing.

security-sensitive projects, Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe
projects and Guidelines on the classification of information in Digital Europe projects.

AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14) (DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
[OPTION for programmes with specific ethics rules: Ethics
Actions involving activities raising ethics issues must be carried out in compliance with:
- ethical principles [(including the highest standards of research integrity)]
and
- applicable EU, international and national law, including [the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights
and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and
its Supplementary Protocols][[other programme-specific legal acts]].
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to [the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the
right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of persons, the right to
non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the environment and high levels of human health
protection].
Before the beginning of an action task raising an ethical issue, the beneficiaries must have obtained all
approvals or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any (national or
local) ethics committee or other bodies [such as data protection authorities].
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting
authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary, which shows
that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the conclusions of the committee or
authority concerned (if any).]
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14) (HE, RFCS)
[OPTION for programmes with specific ethics and research integrity rules: Ethics and research integrity
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
- ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity) and
- applicable EU, international and nationallaw, including the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its
Supplementary Protocols.
No funding can be granted, within or outside the EU, for activities that are prohibited in all Member States.
No funding can be granted in a Member State for an activity which is forbiddenin that Member State.
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the
right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of persons, the right to
non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the environment and high levels of human health
protection.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action have an exclusive focus on civil
applications.
350EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action do not:
- aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes
- intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such modifications
heritable (with the exception of research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads, which may be
financed)
- intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell
procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or
- lead to the destruction of human embryos (for example, for obtaining stem cells).
[Activities involving research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells may be carried out only
if:
- they are set out in Annex 1 or
- the coordinator has obtained explicit approval (in writing) from the granting authority.]
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the fundamental principle of research integrity —as set out in the
European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity59.
This implies compliance with the following principles:
- reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis
and the use of resources
- honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a
transparent, fair and unbiased way
- respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the
environment
- accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organisation, for
training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts
and means that beneficiaries must ensure that persons carrying out research tasks follow the good research
practices including ensuring, where possible, openness, reproducibility and traceability and refrain from the
research integrity violations described in the Code.
Activities raising ethical issues must comply with the additional requirements formulated by the ethics
panels (including after checks, reviews or audits; see Article 25).
Before starting an action task raising ethical issues, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals or
other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any (national or local) ethics
committee or other bodies such as data protection authorities.
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting
authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary, which shows
that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the conclusions of the committee or
authority concerned (if any).

The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on ethics (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
351EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Some programmes with ethics-sensitive calls (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI) also have specific provisions on ethics in Annex 5.
Depending on the programme, the obligations may vary.
2. Ethical principles and applicable law (HE, RFCS)
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
− ethical principles (including, where applicable the highest standards of research
integrity) and
− applicable international, EU and national law.
The main ethical principles depend on the domain. For research and innovation related
domains, they are:
Main ethical principles:
▪ Respecting human dignity and integrity
▪ Ensuring honesty and transparency towards research subjects and notably
getting free and informed consent (as well as assent whenever relevant)
▪ Protecting vulnerable persons
▪ Ensuring privacy and confidentiality
▪ Promoting justice and inclusiveness
▪ Minimising harm and maximising benefit
▪ Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially if the research
is being carried out in developing countries
▪ Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction
and refinement (‘3Rs’) in animal research
▪ Respecting and protecting the environment and future generations
The key sources of EU and international law are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols (for
other texts). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (UN CRPD). In addition, some programmes mention sector-specific legislation
(such as, for instance, the EU Directives on animal health and organic-labelling for EMFAF).
3. Exclusive focus on civil applications (HE and RFCS)
For programmes with this provision (HE and RFCS), the activities under the action must have
an exclusive focus on civil applications.
This does not mean that the research results cannot peripherally be useful in a military
context. Research related to dual-use products or technologies (usually used for civilian
purposes but with possible military applications) is not prohibited (e.g. development of an
algorithm that might also be used for optimising military logistics). However, activities that
focus on military applications will NOT be funded (e.g. development of a robot designed for
military intervention).
4. Prohibited activities and activities involving research on human embryos or
human embryonic stem cells (HE)
Prohibited activities may not take place under the action.
352EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Activities that involve human embryos (hE) or human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can only
be funded, if:
− they comply with the Statement by the Commission on research activities involving
human embryos or human embryonic stem cells54 (in particular, do NOT result in the
destruction of human embryos)
and
− they are set out in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement or
− the coordinator has obtained explicit approval by the granting authority.
These activities are de facto considered as raising sensitive ethics issues and must always
undergo an ethics assessment (see below) that can lead to ethics requirements that will be
included in Annex 1.
5. Research integrity (HE and RFCS)
In order to meet the highest standards of research integrity, the beneficiaries must follow the
principles listed in this provision and ensure that the persons carrying out research tasks
comply with the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (i.e. follow the good
research practices listed in this Code and refrain from any research integrity violations it
describes).
They also must ensure that appropriate procedures, policies and structures are in place to
foster responsible research practices, to prevent questionable research practices and
research misconduct, and to handle allegations of breaches of the principles and standards in
the Code of Conduct (see Guidelines for Promoting Research Integrity in Research Performing
Organisation).
Fundamental research integrity principles:
▪ reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the
methodology, the analysis and the use of resources
▪ honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating
research in a transparent, fair and unbiased way
▪ respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural
heritage and the environment
▪ accountability for the research from the idea to publication, for its management
and organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider
impacts.
The Code constitutes a general reference framework and takes into account the legitimate
interests of the beneficiaries (i.e. regarding IPRs and data sharing). This does not change the
other obligations under this Agreement or obligations under applicable international, EU or
national law, all of which still apply.
In addition, beneficiaries should rely on local, national or discipline-specific guidelines, if such
documents exist and are not contrary to the Code.

6. Activities raising ethics issues (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
For these programmes, proposals may have to undergo an ethics review before selection and
will, if one or more ethics issues are identified, be made subject to ethics requirements to be
solved immediately or implement during the grant. In the latter case, they will be included
as deliverables in Annex 1.
Examples (ethics issues): involvement of patients, volunteers, children or vulnerable
populations; use of human (embryonic) stem cells; implication of developing countries; collecting
and processing of personal data; use of animals; risk of environmental impact.
Examples (ethics deliverables): to submit to the granting authority a report on certain ethics
issues during the course of the action.
Examples (ethics requirements before grant signature): confirmation personal data of this
study will not be transferred outside the EU.
In addition, beneficiaries must obtain — before starting an action task raising ethical issues —
all the necessary ethics opinions, notifications and authorisations. These documents do not
need to be submitted, but must be kept on file and provided on request (in case of ethics
reviews, checks or audits). They must be able to show that the
opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the tasks to be undertaken in the context of the
action. If the documents are not in English, beneficiaries may be asked to provide an English
summary.
Best practice: When preparing the applications for such opinions/notifications/ authorisations,
beneficiaries should request the assistance of ethics experts, research ethics
departments/committees and of their organisation’s data protection officer.
The granting authority may carry out ethics checks or reviews to ensure that the beneficiaries
have properly implemented the ethics requirements and obtained the
opinions/notifications/authorisations (see Article 25).
Specific cases (ethics):
Activities carried out in a non-EU country — Such activities must comply with the laws of
that country AND be allowed in at least one EU Member State. The beneficiaries must sign
the related declaration in their application.

VALUES (— ARTICLE 14) (HE, RFCS)
[OPTION for programmes with gender rules: Gender mainstreaming
The beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities between men and women in the
implementation of the action and, where applicable, in line with the gender equality plan. They must aim, to
the extent possible, for a gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the action, including at
supervisory and managerial level.]
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on EU values (HE and RFCS)
For some programmes (HE and RFCS), Annex 5 includes specific provisions on EU values.
2. Gender mainstreaming (HE and RFCS)
The beneficiaries must take all measures:
− to promote gender equality, i.e. equal opportunities between men and women in the
implementation of the action, and
− in line with their gender equality plan (GEP), if applicable.
Promote gender equality:
The beneficiaries should:
− aim for a balanced participation of women and men in their research teams
− being proactive in ensuring gender balance among the individuals who are primarily
responsible for carrying out the work (in accordance with the categories defined in
the monitoring system)
− being proactive in promoting gender equality among consortium members and
participants in the implementation of the action.
Examples (measures to promote gender equality within a project): Transparency of
recruitment and advancement processes, including gender-sensitive language in vacancies and job-
descriptions; plans and conditions for career advancement; transparent gender equal wage
classification and grading of jobs; development of leadership opportunities; gender planning and
budgeting; gender impact assessment of policies; climate surveys of institutions; trainings on
unconscious gender biases in recruitment and assessment of researchers, as well as in
collaborative work; adoption of family-friendly policies; promotion of gender-sensitive mobility and
dual-career couples schemes; measures to prevent and address gender based violence such as
sexual harassment.
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must aim — to the extent possible —
for a gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the action, including at the
supervisory and managerial levels.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken and measures put in place (see Article 20).
355EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In addition, the gender dimension should be integrated in research and innovation content.
This is a by default requirement for all Horizon Europe RIA/IA and Programme Cofund
actions, with some exceptions.
For more guidance on gender equality, including the integration of the gender dimension into
research and innovation content, see HE Programme Guide > Gender equality.
Gender equality plan:
The gender equality plan (GEP) is an eligibility criterion for participating in Horizon Europe
actions for legal entities from Member States and HE associated countries that are:
− public bodies
− research organisations
− higher education establishments.
The ‘gender equality plan’ is a document that sets out the gender equality strategy of an
organisation.
The GEP does not apply to other types of legal entities e.g. private for-profit organisations,
including SMEs, non-governmental or civil society organisations.
The GEP (or equivalent document) must cover the following minimum process-related
requirements:
− publication: a formal document published on the institution’s website and endorsed
by the top management. Endorsement can refer to the signature of the document, the
minutes of the management meeting where the decision was taken, a press release
informing about its approval or a document having a foreword and/or other form of
top management statement.
− dedicated resources: commitment of resources to implement the plan
− data collection and monitoring: regular (at least once in two years) collection of
sex/gender disaggregated data on personnel (and students, for the establishments

RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE (— ARTICLE 16) (DEP, EDF)
[OPTION for programmes with specific IPR rules:
Definitions
Access rights — Rights to use results or background.
357EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Dissemination — The public disclosure of the results by appropriate means, other than resulting from
protecting or exploiting the results, including by scientific [or professional] publications
in any medium.
Exploit(ation) — The use of results in further [innovation and deployment] activities other than those
covered by the action concerned, including among other things, commercial exploitation
such as developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, creating
and providing a service, or in standardisation activities.
Fair and reasonable conditions — Appropriate conditions, including possible financial terms or royalty-free
conditions, taking into account the specific circumstances of the request for access, for
example the actual or potential value of the results or background to which access is
requested and/or the scope, duration or other characteristics of the exploitation
envisaged.

The beneficiaries must, where industrial and intellectual property rights (including rights of third parties)
exist prior to the Agreement, establish a list of these pre-existing industrial and intellectual property rights,
specifying the rights owners.
The coordinator must — before starting the action — submit this list to the granting authority.
[Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic autonomy reasons,
background that is subject to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not
one of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the results (i.e.
would make the results subject to control or restrictions) must not be used and must be explicitly excluded in
the list of background — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.]
[Results free from restrictions
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to [security or EU strategic autonomy reasons],
the beneficiaries must ensure that the results of the action are not subject to control or other restrictions by a
country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the
call conditions — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.]
Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them (unless the consortium agreement specifies another
ownership regime).
[For […] however, two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:
- they have jointly generated them and
- it is not possible to:
- establish the respective contribution of each beneficiary, or
- separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection.
The joint owners must agree — in writing — on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership
(‘joint ownership agreement’), to ensure compliance with their obligations under this Agreement.]
Protection of results
The beneficiaries must adequately protect their results — for an appropriate period and with appropriate
territorial coverage — if protection is possible and justified, taking into account all relevant considerations,
including the prospects for commercial exploitation, legitimate interests of the other beneficiaries and any
other legitimate interests.
[Exploitation of results

(and unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority), the beneficiaries must produce a significant
amount of products, services or processes that incorporate results of the action or that are produced through
the use of results of the action in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.
Where the call conditions impose moreover a first exploitation obligation, the first exploitation must also
take place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.
The beneficiaries must ensure that these obligations also apply to their affiliated entities, associated partners,

are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless they have requested and received
prior approval by the granting authority.
The request must:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner and the planned or potential exploitation of the results and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer [or license] on the [security
interests or EU strategic autonomy].
The granting authority may request additional information.
[The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under the Agreement are passed on to the new owner
and that this new owner has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer.]

to results for policy purposes
The beneficiaries must grant access to their results — on a royalty-free basis — to the granting authority,
other EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, for developing, implementing and monitoring EU policies
or programmes. [Such access does not extend to beneficiaries’ background.]
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
[The access rights also extend to national authorities of EU Member States or associated countries, for
developing, implementing and monitoring their policies or programmes in this area. In this case, access is
subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency (including the granting
authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.]
[Access rights for the granting authority to results in case of a public emergency
If requested by the granting authority in case of a public emergency, the beneficiaries must grant non-
exclusive, world-wide licences to third parties — under fair and reasonable conditions — to use the results to
address the public emergency.]
[Access rights for third parties to ensure continuity and interoperability
Where the call conditions impose continuity or interoperability obligations, the beneficiaries must make the
[materials, documents and information] [and] [results] produced in the framework of the action available to
the public (freely accessible on the Internet under [open licences] [or] [open source licences]).]
Access rights for national authorities to the special report for use by/for armed forces or security or
intelligence forces
For Research Actions, the beneficiaries must grant access to the special report — on a royalty-free basis — to
national authorities of EU Member States or associated countries for use by/for their armed forces or security
or intelligence forces (including in the framework of cooperative programmes).
‘Special report’ means the specific deliverable summarising the results of a research project and providing
information on the basic principles, aims, outcomes, basic properties, tests performed, potential benefits,
potential defence applications and expected exploitation path of the research towards development. It may
also include information on the ownership of IPRs.
Access to the special report will be granted by the granting authority, after having ensured that appropriate
confidentiality obligations are in place.
Access rights for third parties to further develop results
For Research Actions, the beneficiaries must grant access — on a royalty-free basis — to results which are
necessary for the execution of other EU grants or contracts between national authorities of two or more EU
Member States or associated countries and one or more beneficiaries, to further develop together results
generated by the action.
In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.]

[Scope of the obligations
For this section, references to ‘beneficiary’or ‘beneficiaries’do not include affiliated entities (if any).]
[Agreement on background — Background free from restrictions
The beneficiaries must identify in a written agreement the background as needed for implementing the action
or for exploiting its results.
Where the call conditions restrict control due to strategic interests reasons, background that is subject to
control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries
or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the exploitation of the results (i.e. would

Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them.[[…]]
361EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
[However, two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:
- they have jointly generated them and
- it is not possible to:
- establishthe respective contribution of each beneficiary, or
- separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection.
The joint owners must agree —in writing —on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership

grant non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the jointly-owned results (without any right to sub-
license), if the other joint owners are given:
- at least 45 days advance notice and
- fair and reasonable compensation.
The joint owners may agree —in writing —to apply another regime than joint ownership.
If third parties (including employees and other personnel) may claim rights to the results, the beneficiary
concerned must ensure that those rights can be exercised in a manner compatible with its obligations under
the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must indicate the owner(s) of the results (results ownership list) in the final periodic
report.]
Protection of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must adequately protect their results —for an
appropriate period and with appropriate territorial coverage —if protection is possible and justified, taking
into account all relevant considerations, including the prospects for commercial exploitation, the legitimate
interests of the other beneficiaries and any other legitimate interests.
Exploitation of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must —up to four years after the end of the action
(see Data Sheet, Point 1) —use their best efforts to exploit their results directly or to have them exploited
indirectly by another entity, in particular through transfer or licensing.
[If, despite a beneficiary’s best efforts, the results are not exploited within one year after the end of the
action, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the granting authority) use the Horizon
Results Platform to find interested parties to exploit the results.
If results are incorporated in a standard, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed with the granting
authority or unless it is impossible) ask the standardisation body to include the funding statement (see Article
17) in (information related to) the standard.]
[Additional exploitation obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations (including obligations linked to the
restriction of participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons), the
beneficiaries must comply with them —up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency, the
beneficiaries must (if requested by the granting authority) grant for a limited period of time specified in the
request,non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable conditions — to their results to legal entities that
need the results to address the public emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting
products and services at fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after the end
of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
362EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Additional information obligation relating to standards
Where the call conditions impose additional informationobligations relating to possible standardisation,the
beneficiaries must —up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —inform the
granting authority, if the results could reasonably be expected to contribute to European or international
standards.
Transfer and licensing of results
Transfer of ownership
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect compliance with their
obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under the Agreement regarding their results are passed on
to the new owner and that this new owner has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer.
Moreover, they must inform the other beneficiaries with access rights of the transfer at least 45 days in
advance (or less if agreed in writing), unless agreed otherwise in writing for specifically identified third
parties including affiliated entities or unless impossible under the applicable law. This notification must
include sufficient information on the new owner to enable the beneficiaries concerned to assess the effects on
their access rights. The beneficiaries may object within 30 days of receiving notification (or less if agreed in
writing), if they can show that the transfer would adversely affect their access rights. In this case, the transfer
may not take place until agreement has been reached between the beneficiaries concerned.
Granting licences
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results (or otherwise give the right to exploit them), including on
an exclusive basis, provided this does not affect compliance with their obligations.
Exclusive licences for results may be granted only if all the other beneficiaries concerned have waived their
access rights.
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing [— Horizon Europe actions]
Where the call conditions in Horizon Europe actions provide for the right to object to transfers or licensing,
the granting authority may — up to [four][[…]] years after the endof the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —

- [the beneficiaries which generated the results have received funding under the grant]
- it is to a legal entity established in a non-EU country not associated with Horizon Europe, and
- the granting authority considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests.
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting
authority before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation of the results,
and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU interests, in
particular regarding competitiveness as well as consistency with [ethical principles and security
considerations].
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the granting authority decides to object to a transfer or exclusive licence, it must formally notify the
beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information it has
requested).

If a beneficiary is no longer involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant access.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary no longer has
access rights.]
[Access rights for implementing the action
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —on a royalty-free basis —to background needed to
implement their own tasks under the action, unless the beneficiary that holds the background has —before
acceding to the Agreement —:
- informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is subject to restrictions, or
- agreed with the other beneficiaries that access would not be ona royalty-free basis.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —on a royalty-free basis —to results needed for

action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
365EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
[Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and national authorities
to results for policy purposes [— Horizon Europe actions]
[In Horizon Europe actions,] the beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must grant access
to their results —on a royalty-free basis —to the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or
agencies for developing, implementing and monitoring EU policies or programmes. Such access rights do not
extend to beneficiaries’ background.
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
For actions under the cluster ‘Civil Security for Society’, such access rights also extend to national
authorities of EU Member States for developing, implementing and monitoring their policies or programmes
in this area. In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency (including the granting
authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.]

Undertaking Fusion for Energy for developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and
programmes or for compliance with obligations assumed through international cooperation with non-EU
countries and international organisations.
Such access rights include the right to authorise third parties to use the results in public procurement and the
right to sub-license and are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.]
Additional access rights
Where the call conditions impose additional access rights, the beneficiaries must comply with them.]
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on IPR, background and results (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules regarding background and results and linked
intellectual property rights.
Most programmes use the standard set of additional rules concerning rights of use by the
granting authority of results for information, communication, dissemination and publicity
purposes. Some programmes (especially HE, RFCS, DEP and EDF) use more customised
provisions that may vary from programme to programme.
For Horizon Europe, the references to ‘beneficiary’ or ‘beneficiaries’ in this section do NOT
include affiliated entities. However, there are specific access rights provisions for entities under the
same control in line with the HE Regulation 2021/695 (e.g. for access rights).
2. List of background (some programmes)
366EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Programmes with actions that rely a lot on pre-existing data, know-how or information
including linked intellectual property rights, have a provision obliging the beneficiaries to
establish a so-called ‘list of background’. This list should include both background owned by
project participants and rights owned by third parties. It will allow the consortium to make
sure that everyone has the rights they need for their part of the project.
Depending on the programme, the list remains either consortium-internal or must be shared
with the granting authority (usually before starting the action).
3. Rights of use on results for information, communication, dissemination and
publicity purposes (most programmes)
Most programmes contain a provision allowing the granting authority to use results for
information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes.
This concerns only non-sensitive information and aims mainly the communication and
dissemination activities that are part of the programme management (e.g. press
communications, stakeholder consultations, results portals, media and web-presence, etc).
4. Agreement on background (some programmes)
For some programmes, the list of background must be defined in a written agreement, in
which the beneficiaries identify and agree on what constitutes background for their action.
This list will be the basis for the access obligations.
Specific cases (background):
Limitations to use of background due to security or strategic interests (restricted
calls) (HE, DEP, EDF) — Where the work programme/call conditions provide for restricted
participation (e.g. due to security or strategic interests reasons), background that is subject
to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the
eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that would impact the
exploitation of the results should normally not be used (if possible).
The precise scope of this provision depends on the programme. Please cross-check with
the Grant Agreement you signed!
‘Background that impacts the exploitation of results’ should be understood as making the
exploitation of those results subject to control or restrictions, for example if exploitation
would require the agreement of the entity owning the background. If such background needs
to be used, this must first be agreed with the granting authority.
5. Ownership of results (HE)
Results belong to the beneficiary that generated/produced them (see Article 16.2).
Best practice: To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, keep documents such as laboratory
notebooks to show who produced the results, how and when.
If others (‘third parties’) could claim rights on results, the beneficiaries must ensure that they
can respect their obligations under the grant by making arrangements (transfers, licences,
other) with the third parties (e.g. affiliated entities, associated partners, associated partners
linked to a beneficiary in MSCA, employees, subcontractors, other members of Joint research
units (JRUs), etc). Such arrangements could be separate between the beneficiaries and the
third party, or in the consortium agreement if they concern affiliated entities or associated
partners. If making such arrangements is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using
the third party to generate the results.
Examples (third parties that may claim rights): academic institutions in countries that have a
kind of ‘professor’s privilege’ system (according to which researchers may have some rights to the
367EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
results of university research); employees or students who carry out work for the action (if they
have rights under national law or their contract); beneficiaries for which affiliated entities carry out
a part of the work.
Examples (arrangements): transferring (partial) ownership to the beneficiary; granting access
rights to the beneficiary with a right to sub-license.
The list of owners of the results generated by the action must be provided to the granting
authority at the end of the action in the final reporting (results ownership list (ROL)).
In case of joint ownership, all joint owners must be listed even if (some of) the joint owners
are not members of the consortium. The results ownership list provides a snapshot in time,
meaning that ownership changes may happen after the submission of the final periodic
report.
If the ownership of the results is not clear, the beneficiaries should indicate all potential
owners.
Example: A beneficiary is involved in a legal dispute on the ownership.
Specific cases (ownership of results):
Results generated by associated partners — For results generated by associated
partners, the situation is similar to that of beneficiaries not having received funds within the
meaning of the HE Regulation 2021/695. Provisions in the Annex 5 that apply only to
‘beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant’ do NOT apply (e.g. the obligation
to protect the results or the best efforts obligation to exploit the results). Respect of all other
obligations (e.g. obligation to provide access if needed to implement the project or exploit the
results or obligations related to dissemination/open science) must be ensured.
Automatic joint ownership — If beneficiaries have jointly generated results and it is not
possible to establish their respective contribution or to separate them for protection, the
beneficiaries automatically become joint owners.
In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must conclude a joint ownership agreement (in
writing).
This agreement should cover in particular:
Joint ownership agreement content:
▪ how the ownership is divided (e.g. equally or not).
▪ if/how the joint results will be protected, including issues related to the cost of
protection (e.g. patent filing and examination fees, renewal fees, prior state-of-
the-art searches, infringement actions, etc), or to the sharing of revenues or
profits.
▪ how the joint results will be exploited and disseminated.
▪ how disputes will be settled (e.g. via a mediator, applicable law, etc).
Best practice: Include at least general principles on joint ownership already in the consortium
agreement to make it easier to negotiate a full joint ownership agreement later on.
Unless otherwise provided in the consortium agreement or the joint ownership agreement,
the joint owners automatically have the right to grant non-exclusive licences to third parties
against fair and reasonable compensation (without prior authorisation from the other joint
owners). The joint owner that intends to grant the licence must give the other joint owners at
least 45 days advance notice (together with sufficient information, to check if the proposed
compensation is fair and reasonable). Such licences may not include sub-licensing.
368EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The joint owners may agree in writing not to continue with joint ownership and apply another
regime.
Example: The joint owners may transfer ownership to a single owner and agree on more
favourable access rights (or on any other fair counterpart). In such case, the rules regarding
transfer of ownership apply.
The joint owners may agree to apply another regime even before the results are generated,
e.g. in the consortium agreement, if they consider it appropriate.
Joint ownership by agreement — Outside the cases described above, the beneficiaries
may also become joint owners if they specifically agree on it.
Example: A beneficiary may decide that a part of its results will be owned jointly with its parent
company or another third party. Also in this case, the rules regarding transfer or ownership apply.
6. Protection of results (HE)
‘Beneficiaries having received funding under the grant’ must:
– examine the possibility of protecting their results and
– if possible and justified taking into account all relevant considerations, protect them.
Examples (no protection necessary): If protection is impossible under EU or national law or not
justified (in view of the absence of potential for commercial or industrial exploitation, if the action’s
objective does not require protection, if additionally protecting a part of certain technology would
not bring significantly broader protection, etc)
Beneficiaries are in principle free to choose any available form of protection, but protection
should be adequate depending on the characteristics of the results to ensure effective
protection. While some forms of IP protection, such as copyright, do not require registration,
others, such as patent, trade marks or industrial design require the filing of an application
before the relevant registration body. Although important for commercial and industrial
exploitation, IP protection is not mandatory, if not justified.
Standard forms of protection:
▪ Patent
▪ Trademark
▪ Industrial design
▪ Copyright
Examples: Protection for a design: e.g. industrial design, copyright.
In some cases, it may be advisable to protect an invention by keeping it confidential as a
trade secret, or to postpone the filing of a patent (or other IPR) application.
Example (better not to protect for the moment): Keeping an invention (temporarily)
confidential could allow further development of the invention while avoiding the negative
consequences associated with premature filing (earlier priority and filing dates, early publication,
possible rejection due to lack of support or industrial applicability, etc) but this requires careful
consideration given the possible risks of such an approach.
Best practice: Consider seeking expert advice to help you to decide whether and how to
protect results.
Costs related to protection are eligible, if they fulfil the cost eligibility conditions set out in
Article 6.
369EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
When deciding on protection, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’
legitimate interests. Any other beneficiary invoking legitimate interests must demonstrate
how the decision would harm them. The mere fact that the protection would establish an
exclusive right which could affect beneficiaries which are competitors is not a legitimate
interest.
Example (harm): The protection could lead to the disclosure of valuable background that is held
by the other beneficiary (as a trade secret or flagged as confidential) and may require coordination.
Best practice: Although beneficiaries are not required to consult other beneficiaries before
deciding whether to protect their results or not, it may be advisable to provide for
arrangements (either in the consortium agreement or in separate agreements), to ensure
that where needed decisions on protection take due account of the interests of all
beneficiaries concerned.
Protection should last for an appropriate period and have appropriate territorial coverage (in
view of potential) commercial or industrial exploitation and other elements (e.g. potential
markets and countries in which potential competitors are located).
Patent applications should identify the rightful inventors.
Example (not rightful inventor): An entity systematically designates a head of department as
one of the inventors, although it is not true.
Be aware that errors (or fraud) in identifying inventors may lead to the invalidation of
the patent.
7. Exploitation of results (HE)
The beneficiaries must take measures aiming to ensure the exploitation of their results —
either by themselves (e.g. a beneficiary owning results uses them directly) or indirectly by
others (other beneficiaries or third parties, e.g. through licensing or by transferring the
ownership of results).
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific
measures to try to ensure that their results are exploited (to the extent possible and
justified).
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken (see Article 20).
Security obligations — Exploitation must be compliant with other grant obligations,
such as security rules (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
Where possible, these measures should be consistent with the impact expected from the
action and the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results. The exploitation of
results should take into consideration the objectives of the Horizon Europe Programme (see
specific objectives in Article 3(2) of the HE Regulation 2021/695), including promoting
innovation in the EU and strengthening the European Research Area.
The ’plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities’
is a document that details the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that
will be carried out during the project (or afterwards) , to achieve the expected impact.
All proposals must (unless explicitly excluded by the work programme/call conditions),
include a first version of the plan (summary of the planned activities under the description of
the impact pathways). If successful, the projects will then have to provide the complete plan
for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities (normally
within the first six months of the action and then regularly update it). Moreover, beneficiaries
370EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
will have to report on the activities undertaken. See Annex 5 > Communication,
dissemination and visibility.
‘Exploitation’ (as defined at the beginning of Annex 5) means the use of results in further
research and innovation activities other than those covered by the action concerned,
including among other things, commercial exploitation such as developing, creating,
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in
standardisation activities.
Exploitation can also be non commercial, for example use in non-commercial research
or non-commercial teaching activities. When results of the action are used to influence R&I
policy or decision making, this is another form of exploitation.
Best practice: Consider applying for dissemination and exploitation support services,
including go to market support and IP management provided by the European Commission,
during and after the end of your action i.e. the Horizon Results Booster. This service is
available to all running and finished projects.
The best effort obligation applies only to ‘beneficiaries having received funding under the
grant’ and applies during the action and up to four years after the end of the action.
Specific case (exploitation of results):
Additional exploitation obligations (HE) — Where the work programme/call conditions
provide for additional exploitation obligations, those obligations must also be complied
with/fulfilled (by ALL beneficiaries, unless explicitly stated otherwise).
Additional information obligation relating to standards (HE) — Where the work
programme/call conditions provide for this additional obligation, the beneficiaries must
moreover inform the granting authority on any results that could contribute to European or
international standards.
Example: The results are produced in an area in which standards play an important role (such as
in mobile communication, diagnostics or immunological diseases).
Public emergency — Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional
exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency, when requested by the granting
authority, the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences under fair and reasonable
conditions to legal entities that need the results to address the public emergency and commit
to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services at fair and reasonable
conditions.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. for HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Be also aware that for calls specifically addressing a public emergency, the additional
exploitation obligations may already have been activated directly in the work
programme/call conditions. In this case, there will normally not be an additional request by
the granting authority.
‘Public emergencies’ are emergencies characterised by an unexpected genuine and
sufficiently serious threat undermining EU security, public order or public health.
Examples: Public emergencies could cover events such as pandemic diseases (like Covid-19),
terrorist attacks, hacking, earthquakes, tsunamis, CBRN events, e.g. novel and highly fatal
infectious agents or biological or chemical toxins, as well as those from resulting cascading risks.
371EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The public emergency obligation is a last resort option that will only be activated if the
granting authority considers that the EU security, public order or public health cannot be
protected by any less restrictive measure.
Thus, the granting authority will for instance not request activation of the public emergency
obligation if it considers that the beneficiary is able to address the public emergency themself
and commits to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services directly or
indirectly at fair and reasonable conditions. In most cases the obligation will therefore
probably remain dormant.
In case of activation of the public emergency provision by a request of the granting authority,
the duration of the obligations and the fairness and reasonability of the licences will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the specific circumstances of the public
emergency, the context of each project and the nature of its results.
As this is an additional exploitation obligation, the beneficiary cannot OPT out and must
comply with the additional obligations if requested by the granting authority.
Best practice: If you intend to grant any exclusive licences to results that might be
concerned, you must make sure that the licensing agreement allows for an eventual
activation of the obligation (e.g. that it allows you to suspend the exclusive character and
grant licences).
Horizon Results Platform (HE) — The Horizon Results Platform (HRP) is a platform
developed by the European Commission to help promote the exploitation of the results from
the R&I framework programmes. It allows beneficiaries of grants from FP7, Horizon 2020,
Horizon Europe and Euratom to publish and promote the uptake of their results towards their
target audiences. It can be accessed by beneficiaries through the Portal.
Detailed instructions on how to publish results can be found in the IT How To > Managing
Project Results in the Horizon Results Platform.
Beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to consider the use of this free Platform to their own
benefit, at any stage of the project, during as well as after the end of the project, provided
they have key exploitable results (KER; high potential to be exploited, i.e.to be used in a
product, process or service, or act as an important input to further research, R&I related
policy or education, etc). Results such as outcomes or announcements of consortia meetings,
conferences or other events are not considered as key exploitable results and all project
deliverables are not necessarily key exploitable results either.
Publishing results in the Horizon Results Platform ensures high visibility to a variety of
potential users and stakeholders including industry, academia, investors, public
administrations, etc and may lead to finding help to exploit the results directly (e.g.
financing) or finding third parties which may be interested to exploit the results.
Example: Certain beneficiaries in a project have developed a prototype and have jointly filed for
intellectual property protection, however they do not have the capacity to bring the results to the
market. The beneficiaries concerned published their results on the Horizon Results Platform and a
company signalled its interest to use the technology in its production line. After negotiations, the
beneficiaries agreed to transfer ownership of the prototype and any attached rights to this
company in return for royalties.
The use of the Horizon Results Platform becomes mandatory, if one year after the end of
the action, key exploitable results are not exploited.
Example: Beneficiaries in a project have developed R&I policy recommendations and guidelines to
be used by public authorities in case of water pollution resulting from industrial activities. The
beneficiaries would like to see them being used but despite their best efforts they have not
managed to have local authorities use them. At the latest one year after the end of the grant, the
beneficiaries must publish the policy recommendations on the Horizon Results Platform (with the
372EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
appropriate result type = ‘policy related result’). Publishing them on HRP will provide them visibility
to policymakers from local, regional, national and EU authorities and also regulatory bodies.
However, if justified on the basis of a request of the beneficiary, the obligation to use the
Horizon Results Platform may be waived.
Examples:
1. A beneficiary is intending to exploit certain key exploitable results commercially, either
directly or indirectly, but awaits a marketing authorisation before being able to do so.
2. Two beneficiaries owning results are close to finalising an agreement with a third party to
exploit certain key exploitable results.
3. The Platform cannot be used because of the security recommendations that the project is
subject to.
Using the Platform does NOT mean that the beneficiary concerned should no longer use its best
efforts to exploit its results directly or indirectly via other means.
8. Transfers and licencing of results (HE)
Transfers of ownership:
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect
compliance with their obligations under the Agreement.
Security obligations — Transfer may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are
subject to limited disclosure/dissemination (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security).
In case of transfer, the beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations (regarding the
results) apply to the new owner and that this new owner will pass them on in any subsequent
transfer (e.g. by including this in their arrangements with the new owner).
Obligations that must be extended to new owners:
▪ Possible joint ownership obligations
▪ Protection of results
▪ Exploitation of results
▪ Transfer and licensing of results
▪ Access rights to result
▪ Dissemination of results, open science and visibility of EU funding.
When transferring ownership, they must also consider the other beneficiaries’ legitimate
interests, in particular:
− the beneficiary that intends to make the transfer must give the other beneficiaries
(that still have or still may request access rights) at least 45 days advance notice (or
less if agreed in writing; together with sufficient information to allow them to properly
assess the extent to which their access rights may be affected)
− any other beneficiary (with access rights) may object to the transfer within 30 days of
receiving notification (or less if agreed in writing), if it can show that it would
373EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
adversely affect its access rights; in this case, the transfer may not take place, until
the beneficiaries concerned reach an agreement
The mere fact that the results concerned are transferred to a competitor is NOT in itself a
valid reason for an objection. The beneficiary concerned must demonstrate the adverse
effects on the exercise of its access rights.
Example (adverse effect): Beneficiary A intends to transfer ownership of a new process it
created during the course of an action to a competitor of beneficiary B. If beneficiary B shows that
its access rights would be adversely affected by such a transfer (for instance, because the
competitor has a proven track record of systematically legally challenging beneficiary B’s claims),
the transfer may not take place until the two beneficiaries reach an agreement.
Granting licences:
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results, including on an exclusive basis, provided
this does not affect compliance with their obligations under this Agreement (e.g. they must in
particular ensure that any access rights can be exercised and that any additional exploitation
obligations are/can be complied with).
Security obligations — Licences may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are
subject to limited disclosure/dissemination (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security).
Exclusive licences (e.g. for commercial exploitation) may be granted only if all other
beneficiaries have waived their access rights and other access rights/obligations are
preserved, (e.g. the access rights of the EU, Member States or activation of the public
emergency obligation if applicable).
Specific cases (transfers and licencing of results):
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) — If a transfer of ownership is not explicit (through an
‘intended’ transfer) but part of a take-over or merger of two companies, confidentiality
constraints normally prevail (under M&A rules). Therefore, it may be necessary to inform the
other beneficiaries only after the merger/acquisition took place, instead of before.
Specifically-identified third parties — The beneficiaries may (by prior written agreement)
waive their right to object to transfers of ownership to a specifically-identified third party
(e.g. an affiliate entity of one of them). In this case, there is no need to inform them of such
transfers in advance (and they do not have the right to object).
Before agreeing to such a global authorisation, beneficiaries should carefully consider the
situation (and in particular the identity of the third party concerned), to determine if their
access rights would be affected.
Example: For large industrial groups, it is sometimes clear from the beginning that all results
produced will be transferred to another entity of the group, without being detrimental to the other
beneficiaries (who agreed to the global authorisation).
If the granting authority has the right to object to transfers, the beneficiary must formally
notify the request to waive its right to object in advance (through Portal Formal Notifications:
My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal
Notification) and the granting authority may object.
Joint research units (JRUs) — Where the internal arrangements of a JRU state that any
results produced by one member are owned jointly by all members, the JRU member that is
the beneficiary must ensure that it complies with the obligations on transfers under the Grant
Agreement (placing results under joint ownership of the JRU is a form of transfer).
374EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Common legal structures (CLS) — CLS (i.e. entities representing several other legal
entities, e.g. European Economic Interest Groupings (EEIG) or associations) that are
beneficiaries of an action may want to transfer ownership to one (or more) of their members.
This is not prohibited. However, the normal rules on transfers apply (e.g. access rights have
to remain available).
Best practice: Beneficiaries that are members of a common legal structure are strongly
advised to agree on specific arrangements with the other members of the common legal
structure, in particular relating to ownership and access rights.
Right to object to transfers or exclusive licensing — Where the work programme/call
conditions provide for the right to object, the granting authority may object to transfers or
exclusive licences (or, for Euratom grants, also non-exclusive licences) to legal entities
established in a non-associated third country if the granting authority considers that the
transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. for HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Possible grounds for objection:
▪ Planned transfer/licence not in line with EU competitiveness interests
Example: if the transfer or licence would create a major competitive disadvantage for
European companies or could make the results commercially unavailable on fair and
reasonable conditions in the EU
▪ Planned transfer/licence not consistent with ethical principles
Example: If the transfer or licence could cause the results to be used in a way that is not in
accordance with the fundamental ethical rules and principles recognised at EU and
international level
▪ Planned transfer/licence not consistent with security considerations (including, for
Euratom grants, the Member States’ defence interests under Article 24 of the
Euratom Treaty)
Example: If the transfer or licence could make results considered significant from a
security standpoint not readily available in the EU, or if security-sensitive results could fall
into the hands of third parties that are considered a security risk
▪ Planned transfer/licence weakens the EU scientific and technological bases.
Example: If the transfer or licence could weaken the EU capacity & independence in
strategic technological areas (e.g. quantum computing, artificial intelligence)
This right does NOT apply to results generated by ‘beneficiaries not having received funding
under the grant’.
The beneficiary must formally notify the granting authority in advance of any planned
transfer or exclusive licence (and, for Euratom grants, also of any non-exclusive licence)
through Portal Formal Notifications (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification).
A notification before the results are generated is allowed, if the specific results concerned
(and the details of the transfer/licence) can already be identified so an assessment can be
made.
Right to object waiver for specifically-identified third parties — A beneficiary may
formally notify (through Portal Formal Notifications: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project
375EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
> Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) a request to waive the right to
object regarding intended transfers or grants to a specifically identified third party, if
measures safeguarding EU interests are in place. If the granting authority agrees, it will
formally notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any
additional information requested).
Limitations to transfers and licensing due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy
or security reasons (restricted calls) — Where the work programme/call conditions
provide for restricted participation, prior approval by the granting authority is required
regarding any transfers or (exclusive or non-exclusive) licences to third parties which are
established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries).
9. Access rights to background & results (HE)
What & When? The beneficiaries must provide access to background and results, if it is
needed:
− by another beneficiary, for implementing action tasks or exploiting results
− by an entity established in a EU Member State or HE associated country and under the
direct or indirect control of another beneficiary, or under the same direct or indirect
control as another beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling such a beneficiary,
to exploit the results generated by that beneficiary— unless otherwise agreed or
provided for in other provisions of the Agreement.
Examples: Beneficiary A used background from beneficiary B to generate its results which is
also needed to exploit those results. Beneficiary A would like to use its entity C, a sister
company under the same control as beneficiary, established in a MS to exploit the results. For
this, entity C needs access rights to beneficiary B’s background. If entity C is established in a
Member State or an associated country, it has access rights unless otherwise provided for in the
consortium agreement. If not, the beneficiaries could agree on additional access rights (see
further below).
Other examples (restrictions) may be in relation to security related provisions or in case of
restrictions due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member
States.
There is NO definition of ‘needed’. The beneficiary owning the background or results has to
assess (on a case by case basis and taking into account the action’s specificities), if the
requesting beneficiary needs the access (and may refuse it, if it does not).
Example (results needed for implementation): If without these results, action tasks could
not be implemented, would be significantly delayed or would require significant additional
financial or human resources.
Example (background needed for exploitation): If without these results, exploiting a
result would be technically or legally impossible or if significant additional R&D work would
have to be carried out outside of the action to develop an alternative equivalent solution.
Best practice: To avoid conflicts and where appropriate, agree (e.g. in the consortium
agreement) on a common interpretation of what is needed.
However, for background there is NO (or a more limited) obligation to give access, if there
are restrictions (legal or otherwise) and the beneficiary has informed the others — before
acceding to the grant (or immediately when additional background is agreed on).
Example: A pre-existing agreement (e.g. an exclusive licence) which precludes the granting of
access rights to certain background for exploitation purposes.
By contrast, if a beneficiary contracts on background later, it must ensure that it can comply
with its access obligations under the grant.
376EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The other beneficiaries may waive their access rights, provided that such a waiver is made
in writing.
Best practice: Waivers should be made only on a case-by-case basis, once the results have
been correctly identified and it is clear that access is not needed.
How? Access rights are not automatic; they must be requested (in writing).
Best practice: Use your internal rules (e.g. consortium agreement) to specify how to make
such written requests.
Access may be requested even from beneficiaries who left the action before the end, under
the same conditions as from active beneficiaries. Similarly, if a beneficiary is no longer
involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant access.
If applicable, for entities established in a EU Member State or a HE associated country and
under the direct or indirect control, or under the same direct or indirect the same control as
another beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling such a beneficiary, access must be
requested directly from the beneficiary owning the background or results. However, the
beneficiary owning the background results may agree to a different arrangement.
Access to results for exploitation may be requested up to one year after the end of the action
— unless the beneficiaries agreed on another time limit.
The agreement by the beneficiary owning the results (on the request for access) may be in
any form (tacit, explicit, in writing or oral).
Best practice: To keep a record of entities that have access, a written agreement may be
needed, in particular for important background or results.
In case of disagreement, the requesting beneficiary can better substantiate its request,
withdraw it or resort to the conflict resolution procedures foreseen by the consortium (e.g. in
the consortium agreement). If a conflict on access rights to results is likely to affect the
action implementation, the beneficiaries must immediately inform the granting authority.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary
no longer has access rights.
Conditions for access:
Royalty free — Fair and reasonable conditions
Access to results must be given:
– for the implementation of action tasks: royalty-free
– for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions.
Examples (monetary compensation): A lump sum, a royalty percentage, or a combination
of both.
Examples (non-financial terms): A requirement to grant access to technology it has, or to
agree on cooperation in a different field or in a future project.
Best practice: In case financial terms are involved, it may not be always possible to
determine, at the moment of agreeing to these terms, what fair and reasonable financial
conditions are, since the potential value of the foreground or background and the ways of
exploitation may not be clear. Beneficiaries could in such cases opt for an open system which
allows them to take into account unexpected developments, for example by adjusting royalty
percentages in case certain milestones are reached.
377EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The conditions for access to background are slightly different. Unless restrictions apply,
access must be given:
– for the implementation of action tasks: the default rule is royalty-free
However, if agreed by the beneficiaries before the grant is signed, for background
other conditions may apply.
Example: A beneficiary owns a novel technology needed by other beneficiaries for
implementing their tasks under the action and the other beneficiaries do not bring the same
level of background. In such case the beneficiaries may agree that access to the novel
technology to implement the action will not be on a royalty-free basis.
Best practice: If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is
recommended that this is explained in detail in their proposal. Royalty fees paid for
access to background for implementation purposes may exceptionally be eligible costs
if explicitly agreed by all beneficiaries before grant signature (see Article 6.2.C.3).
– for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions.
Scope of access:
Sublicensing/Licensing — Additional access rights — More favourable terms — Additional
conditions
The access rights set out in the Grant Agreement cover only the access needed.
Access rights are a right to use by the entity concerned and do NOT automatically give the
right to the requesting beneficiary to sub-licence. (If this were the case, access rights to
results would be extended — without consent — to virtually any entity in the world, including
a beneficiary’s competitors).
Sub-licensing is only allowed if the beneficiary owning the results agrees — although such
agreement should not be unduly refused, if the sublicensing is necessary. In this case the
sub-licensing does not have to be royalty-free (even if the access rights concerned would be)
and can itself be made subject to specific conditions.
Examples:
1. A university may need the right to sub-license access to results needed to exploit its own
results to third parties, to make it possible to derive value from its own results.
2. In large industrial groups it is quite common that research is conducted by one entity and
exploitation by one or several other entities. Access rights enjoyed by the ‘research entity’ but
not by the ‘exploitation entities)’ would raise problems for those entities not covered by the
access rights for entities under the same control.
Best practice: If needed, agree on the terms and conditions of the sub-licensing generally
and in writing (in the consortium agreement or separately).
Examples: In such an agreement, they could foresee that sub-licensing could apply to the
results (or part of them), but not to the background; sub-licensing could apply to (some of the)
entities forming part of the same group , but not to (some of the) other entities.
The beneficiaries remain free to grant licences (including quasi-exclusive licences) to their
own results, as long as they can guarantee that all their grant obligations are/will be
respected, including that all access rights can be exercised. They can even grant an exclusive
licence to exploit their results, if the other beneficiaries have waived any access rights which
would make granting the exclusive licence impossible (and no additional obligations apply
with the same effect, e.g. additional exploitation/access rights obligations).
Beneficiaries are free to grant additional access rights to results, beyond the rights foreseen
in the grant if compatible with their obligations under the grant.
378EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Examples: Additional access rights for third parties (e.g. affiliated entities if they need it for
implementation purposes, entities under same control but not established in an EU Member State
or HE associated country).
Best practice: Such additional provisions may be included in the consortium agreement or in
a separate agreement.
Access may also be granted on more favourable terms (e.g. include the right to sub-licence)
or be made subject to additional conditions (e.g. appropriate confidentiality obligations).
Access rights may be exercised as long as agreed by the concerned beneficiaries (e.g. which
for patents could be until the patent expires).
Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies
and national authorities to results for policy purposes — Horizon Europe actions:
The granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies (and/or EU Member States
national authorities for Horizon Europe actions under the cluster ‘Civil security for Society’)
have specific access rights for policy purposes. Such access does not extend to beneficiaries’
background.
Access rights for the granting authority, Euratom institutions, funding bodies and
the Joint Undertaking Fusion for Energy — Euratom actions:
In Euratom actions, the granting authority, Euratom institutions, Euratom funding bodies and
the Fusion for Energy Joint Undertaking have royalty-free access, for:
− developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and programmes
− complying with Euratom’s obligations under international research and cooperation
agreements in the field of nuclear energy.
These access rights include the right to sub-license (e.g. to third parties involved in such an
international agreement) or to use the results in public procurement, as long as they are only
used for non-commercial and non-competitive purposes.
Example: Euratom is part of the ITER Agreement and is committed to disseminating information
on technological solutions developed in the context of ITER projects, and to sharing them on a
non-discriminatory basis with other ITER members and ITER itself. It does this by giving ITER and
ITER members royalty-free licences, including the right to sub-license, for the intellectual
property produced, so that they can publicly sponsor fusion and research programmes.
Additional access rights:
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional access rights, they must
also be respected and access granted.
Example: Additional access rights for the beneficiaries of linked actions.

COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION, OPEN SCIENCE AND VISIBILITY (— ARTICLE 17)
(HE)
Dissemination
Dissemination of results
The beneficiaries must disseminate their results as soon as feasible,in a publicly available format,subject to
any restrictions due to the protection of intellectual property, security rules or legitimate interests.
A beneficiary that intends to disseminate its results must give at least 15 days advance notice to the other
beneficiaries (unless agreed otherwise), together with sufficient information on the results it will disseminate.
381EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Any other beneficiary may object within (unless agreed otherwise) 15 days of receiving notification, if it can
show that its legitimate interests in relation to the results or background would be significantly harmed. In
such cases, the results may not be disseminated unless appropriate steps are taken to safeguard those
interests.
Additional dissemination obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional dissemination obligations, the beneficiaries must alsocomply
with those.
Open Science
Open science: open access to scientific publications
The beneficiaries must ensure open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to their results. In
particular, they must ensure that:
- at the latest at the time of publication, a machine-readable electronic copy of the published version
or the final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication, is deposited in a trusted repository
for scientific publications
- immediate open access is provided to the deposited publication via the repository, under the latest
available version of the Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or a
licence with equivalent rights; for monographs and other long-text formats, the licence may exclude
commercial uses and derivative works (e.g. CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND) and
- information is given via the repository about any research output or any other tools and instruments
needed to validate the conclusions of the scientific publication.
Beneficiaries (or authors) must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with the open access
requirements.
Metadata of deposited publications must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain Dedication (CC
0) or equivalent, in line with the FAIR principles (in particular machine-actionable) and provide information
at least about the following: publication (author(s), title, date of publication, publication venue); Horizon
Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and number; licensing terms; persistent identifiers
for the publication, the authors involved in the action and, if possible, for their organisations and the grant.
Where applicable, the metadata must include persistent identifiers for any research output or any other tools
and instruments needed to validate the conclusions of the publication.
Only publication fees in full open access venues for scientific publications are eligible for reimbursement.
Open science: research data management
The beneficiaries must manage the digital research data generated in the action (‘data’) responsibly, in line
with the FAIR principles and by taking all of the following actions:
- establish adata management plan (‘DMP’) (and regularly update it)
- as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP, deposit the data in a trusted repository;
if required in the call conditions,this repository must be federated in the EOSC in compliance with EOSC
requirements
- as soon as possible and withinthe deadlines set out in the DMP, ensure open access — via the repository
— to the deposited data, under the latest available version of the Creative Commons Attribution
International Public License (CC BY) or Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0) or a
licence/dedication with equivalent rights, following the principle ‘as open as possible as closed as
necessary’, unless providing open access would in particular:
- be against the beneficiary’s legitimate interests, including regarding commercial exploitation,or
- be contrary to any other constraints, in particular the EU competitive interests or the
beneficiary’s obligations under this Agreement; if open access is not provided (to some or all
data), this must be justified in the DMP
382EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- provide information via therepository about any research output or any other tools and instruments
needed to re-use or validate the data.
Metadata of deposited data must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or
equivalent (to the extent legitimate interests or constraints are safeguarded), in line with the FAIR principles
(in particular machine-actionable) and provide information at least about the following: datasets (description,
date of deposit, author(s) and embargo); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym
and number; licensing terms; persistent identifiers for the dataset, the authors involved in the action, and, if
possible, for their organisations and the grant. Where applicable, the metadata must include persistent
identifiers for related publications and other research outputs.
Open science: additional practices
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding open science practices, the beneficiaries
must also comply with those.
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding the validation of scientific publications,the
beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access to data or other results needed for validation of the
conclusions of scientific publications, to the extent that their legitimate interests or constraints are
safeguarded (and unless they already provided (open) access at publication).
Where the call conditions impose additional open science obligations in case of a public emergency, the
beneficiaries must (ifrequested by the granting authority) immediately deposit any research output in a
trusted repository and provide open access to it under a CC BY licence, a Public Domain Dedication (CC 0)
or equivalent. As an exception, if the access would be against the beneficiaries’ legitimate interests, the
beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licenses —under fair and reasonable conditions —to legal entities that
need the research output to address the public emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the
resulting products and services at fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after
the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities
Unless excluded by the call conditions, the beneficiaries must provide and regularly update a plan for the
exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities.
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules for communication, dissemination and visibility (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules regarding communication and dissemination activities.
Most programmes use the standard set of additional rules concerning the communication and
dissemination plan and the additional communication activities. Some programmes (HE,
RFCS, DEP) use more customised provisions.
2. Communication and dissemination plan (some programmes)
Programmes that need more detailed information about the communication strategy followed
by the action, have a provision obliging the beneficiaries to provide their full communication
plan (— in addition to the key elements that already need to be part of each proposal/DoA
Annex 1).
383EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For more guidance and communication best practices, see Communicating about your EU-
funded project and the HE Social Media Guide.
3. Special logos (some programmes)
In principle, for 2021-2027, all programmes follow the corporate EU visual identity, meaning
that there are in principle no longer any programme-specific logos. There are however
exceptions for some programmes (e.g. CREA Media, LIFE, HUMA, UCPM). Also, Grant
Agreements of EU funding bodies (such as for instance the EU joint undertakings) will keep
using their own logos (in addition to the EU logo) and will require their use by the projects.
4. Limited communication and visibility to protect persons involved (some
programmes)
Some programmes (especially those active in conflicts and crises, like HUMA and RELEX), will
limit communication and visibility options in order to protect the persons working on the
ground. In these cases, the consortium may propose to the granting authority alternative
arrangement.
5. Dissemination (HE)
Unless it goes against their legitimate interests, the beneficiaries must — as soon as feasible,
but not before a decision on their possible protection — disseminate their results, i.e. make
them public.
Security obligations — Dissemination may be restricted/NOT possible for results that
are subject to security rules (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
Results that are disclosed too early (before the decision on their protection) may run the risk
of making protection impossible.
Example: If a result is disclosed (in writing (including by e-mail) or orally (e.g. at a conference)
before filing for patent protection — even to a single person who is not bound by secrecy or
confidentiality obligations (typically someone from an organisation outside the consortium) this
may invalidate a subsequent patent application.
NO dissemination at all may take place, if:
− the results in question need to be protected as a trade secret (i.e. confidential know-
how) or
− dissemination conflicts with any other obligations under the grant (e.g. personal data
protection, security obligations, etc).
The beneficiaries may choose the appropriate publicly available format for disseminating their
results.
Standard forms of dissemination:
▪ website
▪ presentation at a scientific conference, at an education and training event or other
events with stakeholders and potential users of the results
▪ peer-reviewed publication
The dissemination measures should be consistent with the plan for the exploitation and
dissemination of the results (see below) and proportionate to the impact expected from the
action.
384EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
When deciding on dissemination, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’
legitimate interests.
The beneficiary that intends to disseminate must give the other beneficiaries at least 15 days
advance notice (together with sufficient information on the intended dissemination) — unless
otherwise agreed.
Any other beneficiary may object to dissemination — unless otherwise agreed — within 15
days of receiving notification, if it can show that it would suffer significant harm (in relation to
its background or results). In this case, the results may not be disseminated — unless
appropriate steps are taken to safeguard the interests at stake.
Examples (significant harm): Disseminating the results would lead to disclosure of valuable
background held by another beneficiary as a trade secret or would make protecting another
beneficiary’s results more difficult. Appropriate steps could include: omitting certain data or
postponing dissemination until the results are protected.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should provide for arrangements (either in the consortium
agreement or in separate agreements) to ensure that decisions on dissemination take due
account of the interests of all beneficiaries concerned and yet allow for publication of results
without unreasonable delay. This may include a specific mechanism to resolve any disputes
as soon as possible.
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional dissemination obligations,
those obligations must also be complied with/fulfilled.
Example: Requirement to disseminate the results in a specific website.
6. Open science (HE)
‘Open science’ is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of
knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the research process.
The open science provisions in Horizon Europe contain a set of requirements and encouraged
practices that cover some of the most important aspects of open science. They concern
research outputs such as scientific publications and research data and additional open
science practices .
‘Research outputs’ are results to which online access can be given in the form of scientific
publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes, such as software,
algorithms, protocols, models, workflows and electronic notebooks.
6. Open science: Open access to scientific publications (HE)
Beneficiaries must ensure open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to
their results. This includes articles and long-text formats, such as monographs and other
types of books. Immediate open access is required i.e. at the same time as the first
publication, through a trusted repository using specific open licences.
‘Peer review’ is the assessment of manuscripts or publications by researchers with relevant
expertise.
An article is considered to be peer-reviewed when it has been scrutinized and approved by
expert researchers. The number of the positive assessments required is set by each
publishing venue.
Long-text formats — such as books/monographs and edited volumes — are considered to be
peer-reviewed if the manuscript (or a substantial part thereof) has been reviewed at least by
one independent expert external to the publisher or to the series scientific editor(s). PhD
theses and habitations for professorial degrees are considered peer-reviewed, if they are
385EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
formally published through a publisher. Book chapters are NOT considered long-text formats
but are treated similarly to articles.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open access to ALL publications, even
if they are not peer-reviewed.
How to provide open access:
Beneficiaries/authors may publish in the venue of their choice, either in a closed venue (i.e.
access to all content is restricted), an open access publishing venue or in a hybrid publishing
venue, provided that all their open access-related obligations as detailed in this section are
complied with.
‘Open access publishing venues’ are publishing venues whose entire scholarly content is
published in open access (e.g. open access journals, books, publishing platforms, repositories
or preprint servers).
‘Hybrid publishing venues’ are publishing venues which provide part of their scholarly content
in open access, while another part is accessible through subscriptions/payments (e.g. hybrid
journals and books). These are often journals/books based on subscription/purchase which
provide open access to part of their content when an open access fee is paid by their
authors/institutions (paid ad hoc or on the basis of an institutional agreement with the
publishers).
‘Mirror and sister journals’ (i.e. more recently established open access versions of existing
subscription journals, which may share the same editorial board as the original journal and
usually have (at least initially) the same or very similar aims, scope and peer review
processes and policies; these journals often have a name similar to the subscription title but
a different ISSN) are considered open access publishing venues for Horizon Europe grants
(not hybrid journals).
In parallel, beneficiaries/authors must deposit their publication in a machine-readable format
(i.e. structured format that can automatically be read and processed by a computer) in a
trusted repository — before or at publication time — and immediately provide open access to
the publication through that repository.
Publishing in an open access venue without depositing in a repository, does NOT comply
with the open access requirements. All peer-reviewed publications must be deposited in
trusted repositories and open access provided to them through the repositories.
When choosing the publishing venue and the repository, beneficiaries/authors must keep in
mind that licensing requirements, metadata requirements and validation requirements must
also be complied with at this time.
The European Commission offers Horizon Europe beneficiaries Open Research Europe
(ORE), an open access publishing platform with no publishing fees. ORE is offered as
an additional publishing option to Horizon Europe beneficiaries. When ORE is the selected
publishing venue, all requirements for open access to scientific publications are automatically
fulfilled, as ORE deposits publications in the all-purpose repository Zenodo under the
conditions required by Horizon Europe.
Immediate open access through the repository must be provided either to the final peer-
reviewed manuscript accepted for publication or to the final published peer-reviewed version.
Please also note that publication fees are only eligible when publishing in full open access
publishing venues (venues in which the entire scholarly content is openly accessible to all)
and not in hybrid venues. Publication fees may, in particular, include peer review fees,
including where the peer review service has been provided by an organisation different from
386EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
the one providing the publishing venue. Peer review fees for publications are eligible for
reimbursement only for the first round of peer reviewers.
Publishing fees (including page charges or colour charges) for publications in other
venues, for example in subscription journals (including hybrid journals) or in books that
contain some scholarly content that is open and some that is closed are NOT eligible costs.
Publishing fees for open access books may be eligible to the extent that they cover the
first digital open access edition of the book (which could include different formats such as
html, pdf, epub, etc).
Printing fees for monographs and other books are NOT eligible.
Repository requirements:
Beneficiaries must ensure deposition of and open access to publications (and research data,
where the case) through trusted repositories.
‘Repositories’ are online archives, where researchers can deposit digital research outputs and
provide (open) access to them.
Repositories help manage and provide access to scientific outputs and contribute to the long-
term preservation of digital assets.
They can be institutional, operating with the purpose to collect, disseminate and preserve
digital research outputs of individual research organisations (institutional repositories, e.g.
the repository of University X) or domain-specific, operating to support specific research
communities and supported/endorsed by them (e.g. Europe PMC for life sciences including
biomedicine and health or arXiv for physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative
biology, quantitative finance and statistics; Phonogrammarchiv for audio-visual recordings
the CLARIN-DK-UCPH Repository for digital language data or the European Nucleotide Archive
or databases of astronomical observations operated by the European Southern Observatory,
among others). There are also general-purpose repositories, such as for example Zenodo,
developed by CERN.
Personal websites and databases, publisher websites, as well as cloud storage services
(Dropbox, Google drive, etc) are NOT considered repositories. Academia.edu, ResearchGate
and similar platforms do not allow open access under the terms required and therefore are
also NOT considered repositories.
Trusted repositories can be grouped into three categories which may overlap:
− certified repositories, such as those certified by international organisations or
government-authorised certification bodies (e.g. CoreTrustSeal, nestor Seal
DIN31644, ISO16363)
− disciplinary or domain repositories commonly used and endorsed by the research
communities, and which are recognised internationally
− general-purpose repositories, institutional repositories or any other repositories that
present the essential characteristics of trusted repositories, i.e.:
− display specific characteristics of organisational, technical and procedural quality,
such as services, mechanisms and/or provisions that are intended to secure the
integrity and authenticity of their contents, thus facilitating their use and re-use
in the short- and long-term. Trusted repositories have specific provisions in place
and offer explicit information online about their policies, which define their
services (e.g. acquisition, access, security of content, long-term sustainability of
service including funding, etc)
387EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− provide broad, equitable and ideally open access to content free at the point of
use, as appropriate, and respect applicable legal and ethical limitations. They
assign persistent unique identifiers to contents (e.g. DOIs, handles, etc), such
that the contents (publications, data and other research outputs) are
unequivocally referenced and thus citeable. They ensure that contents are
accompanied by metadata sufficiently detailed and of sufficiently high quality to
enable discovery, reuse and citation and contain information about provenance
and licensing. Their metadata is machine-actionable and standardized (e.g.
Dublin Core, Data Cite, etc) preferably using common non-proprietary formats
and following the standards of the respective community the repository serves,
where applicable
− facilitate mid- and long-term preservation of the deposited material. They have
mechanisms or provisions for expert curation and quality assurance for the
accuracy and integrity of datasets and metadata, as well as procedures to liaise
with depositors where issues are detected. They meet generally accepted
international and national criteria for security to prevent unauthorized access
and release of content and have different levels of security, depending on the
sensitivity of the data being deposited, to maintain privacy and confidentiality.
Licensing requirements and IPR:
Scientific publications must be licensed under the latest available version of a Creative
Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or an equivalent licence. For
monographs and other long-text formats the licence may exclude commercial uses and
derivative works (as in CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND or CC BY-NC-ND or equivalent licences).
For more guidance, including an explanatory checklist of the rights conferred by the above
licences that will help researchers to understand publisher-equivalent licences, see the HE
Programme Guide.
Beneficiaries (or authors, where the case) must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to
be able to comply with their open access requirements.
The obligation to ensure open access under the conditions set out in the Grant Agreement
precedes any subsequent publishing agreement and is therefore a prior obligation with
respect to such agreements.
Best practice: Beneficiaries/authors retain the copyright on their work and grant, insofar as
possible, non-exclusive licences to publishers. To facilitate this, beneficiaries should put in
place institutional policies to ensure copyright retention by authors and/or beneficiaries and
compliance with the open access requirements.
To help you find publishing venues that comply with Horizon Europe open access
requirements, you can use:
- the Journal Checker Tool — can help to determine whether a specific publishing venue
allows compliance with the open access obligations of Horizon Europe
- the Directory of Open Access Journals — can help to identify full open access journals
that allow open access publishing under CC BY or an equivalent licence
- Open Research Europe — open access publishing platform of the European
Commission, allows automatic compliance with the Horizon Europe requirements.
Validation requirements:
Information must be given via the repository (or via the copy of the publication deposited in
the repository) about any research output or any other tools and instruments needed to
388EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
validate the conclusions of the scientific publication. Research outputs, tools and instruments
may include data, software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks
and others. Information should include a detailed description of the research
output/tool/instrument, how to access it, any dependencies on commercial products,
potential version/type, potential parameters, etc.
Best practice: It is recommended that open access is provided to these research outputs,
tools and instruments — unless legitimate interests or constraints apply.
Metadata requirements:
Metadata should be in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
principles. In particular, it should be machine-actionable (i.e. machine-readable, and
automatic computer processing can extract information from the metadata attributes
ensuring a cross-linking between different research outputs) and follow a standardised
format, in line with community standards, and should provide rich information on the
publication/data (author(s), publication title, date of publication, publication venue); Horizon
Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and number; licensing terms.
Additionally, metadata must be open access under a Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication (CC0) or equivalent, ensuring its reusability.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or a handle) must
be provided for the peer-reviewed version of the publication in the first publishing venue
(e.g. journal, book, publishing platform); where the peer-reviewed version has been
published in a preprint server or a repository as first publishing venue, the PID of that
version has to be provided. PIDs also have to be provided for all author(s) involved in the
action (such as ORCIDs or ResearcherIDs) and, if possible, for their organisations (such as
ROR IDs) and the grant (such as grant DOIs).
Best practice: It is recommended that researchers apply these requirements for metadata to
digital research outputs, including data and other tools and instruments identified as
necessary to validate publications.
Visibility, acknowledgment of EU support and disclaimers:
Scientific publications must also acknowledge the EU support and display the European flag
(emblem) and funding statement in line with the provisions set out in Article 17 and, where
applicable, the special logos set out in Annex 5 (see specific rules below).
Best practice: In addition to the metadata requirements, in order to facilitate the
identification of your action and follow-up by the granting authority and your
readers/audience, it is recommended to include, within the text of your publication, specific
information on the grant (e.g. project name, acronym, grant agreement number, and/or your
project's digital object identifier (project DOI)).
7. Open science: Research data management (HE)
Beneficiaries must manage responsibly the digital research data generated in the action
(‘data’) in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. They
should also ensure open access to research data via a trusted repository under the principle
‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.
Generated data also includes re-used data that have been processed or modified in a
systematic or methodical way.
The requirements for research data management apply only to data that are generated in the
course of the action. Beneficiaries should also consider re-used data when developing their
389EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
data management plans (DMPs), if they form part of their research and to the extent
possible.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to manage research outputs other than
publications and research data also in line with the FAIR principles and to adequately describe
relevant efforts in the DMP. Other research outputs may include software, algorithms, code,
protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks among others.
How to meet the research data management and open access requirements:
Beneficiaries must do the following to meet the requirements:
− establish a data management plan (DMP), addressing important aspects of research
data management
AND
− deposit the data in a trusted repository and ensure open access through the
repository, as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP.
Data management plan
Beneficiaries must submit a DMP as a mandatory project deliverable (normally within 6
months after grant signature). An updated DMP deliverable must then be produced mid-
project (for projects longer than twelve months) and at the end of the project (where
relevant).
The ‘data management plan (DMP)’ is a document that outlines from the start of the project
the main aspects of the lifecycle of research outputs, notably including data. This includes
their provenance, organisation and curation, as well as adequate provisions for their access,
preservation, sharing, and eventual deletion, both during and after a project.
Writing a DMP is an activity directly linked to the methodology of the research, i.e. good data
management will make the work more efficient/save time, contribute to safeguarding
information and to increasing the impact and the value of the data among the beneficiaries
and others, during and after the research.
Beneficiaries should maintain the DMP as a living document and update it over the course of
the project whenever significant changes arise. This includes (but is not limited to) the
generation of new data, changes in data access provisions or curation policies, attainment of
tasks (e.g. datasets deposited in a repository, etc), changes in relevant practices (e.g. new
innovation potential, decision to file for a patent), changes in consortium composition.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to encode their DMP deliverables as non-
restricted, public deliverables, unless there are reasons (legitimate interests or other
constraints) not to do so. In the case they are made public, it is also recommended that open
access is provided under a CC BY licence to allow a broad re-use.
For more guidance on research data management and making research data FAIR, and for a
DMP template, see the HE Programme Guide.
De posit and ensure open access through trusted repository
The data must be deposited in a trusted repository, ensuring open access via the repository,
as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP.
The deposition of the data must take place as soon as possible after data
production/generation or after adequate processing and quality control have taken place,
providing value and context to the data and at the latest by the end of the project.
390EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This does not entail that data must be made open, but rather that it is deposited so that
metadata information is available and hence information about the data is findable. In
exceptional cases in which specific constraints apply (e.g. security rules), deposition can be
delayed beyond the end of the project.
Best practice: It is recommended to maintain data available for a substantial period — at
least five years, and preferably 10 years or even longer — according to specific needs and/or
disciplinary deposition practices, in line with the recommendations of the European Code of
Conduct for Research Integrity.
The data includes raw data, to the extent technically feasible, but especially if it is crucial to
enable re-analysis, reproducibility and/or data re-use.
Data underpinning a scientific publication should be deposited at the latest at the time of
publication, and in line with standard community practices.
For calls with a condition relating to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), data must be
deposited in trusted repositories that are federated in the EOSC in compliance with the EOSC
requirements. A list of the services offered by EOSC, including for storage and processing of
research data, can be found on the EOSC Portal.
Open access is required as the default for research data under the principle ‘as open as
possible, as closed as necessary’. This means that, as an exception, beneficiaries may or
must keep certain data closed for justified reasons; they must explain in the DMP the
exception(s) under which they choose to (or must) restrict access to some (or all) of the
research data.
Acceptable exceptions are: if providing open access is against the beneficiary’s legitimate
interests, including regarding commercial exploitation; if it is contrary to any other
constraints, such as data protection rules, privacy, confidentiality, trade secrets, EU
competitive interests, security rules, intellectual property rights or would be against other
obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples (valid justification):
1. Data which is commercially valuable may be kept closed if making the data open would
undermine the exploitation of the data or other results (such as could endanger trade secrets) or
make IP protection of results more difficult.
2. Data protection/privacy rules may mean that certain (sensitive) personal data cannot be made
open.
3. Security rules may also require closed data. In projects relating to the strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the Union, data should to be kept closed if making the data open
would put in jeopardy those objectives.
Licensing requirements:
Research data in open access must be licensed under the latest available version of a
Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) requiring attribution of
authorship, or a licence providing equivalent rights, or under a Creative Commons Public
Domain Dedication (CC0) or equivalent (which waives any rights to the data). The latter may
be appropriate in particular for large datasets that can be more easily re-used without
restrictions, or in any other case if authors so desire. A Creative Commons Public Domain
Mark (PDM) or equivalent should be applied to raw research data, unless the data meet the
requirements to be protected by copyright/database right.
Requirements for the re-use and validation of data:
Information must be given via the repository about any research output or any other tools
and instruments needed for the re-use or validation of research data. Research outputs, tools
and instruments may include data, software, algorithms, code, protocols, models, workflows,
electronic notebooks and others. Information must include a detailed description of the
391EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
research output/tool/instrument, how to access it, any dependencies on commercial
products, potential version/type, potential parameters, etc.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open access to these research outputs,
tools and instruments — unless legitimate interests or constraints apply.
Metadata requirements:
Metadata should be in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
principles. In particular, it should be machine-actionable (i.e. machine-readable, and
automatic computer processing can extract information from the metadata attributes
ensuring a cross-linking between different research outputs) and follow a standardised
format, in line with community standards, and should provide rich information on the data
(author(s), dataset description, date of dataset deposit, dataset deposit venue and dataset
embargo (if any)); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and
number; licensing terms.
Additionally, metadata must be open access under a Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication (CC0) or equivalent, to the extent that legitimate interests are safeguarded and
constraints are taken into account.
In cases where data is closed but there are no compelling reasons that the related metadata
should not be findable and accessible, it is recommended that open access is provided to the
metadata of the data, with CC0 public domain dedication or equivalent, if possible, while the
dataset itself remains closed.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) must be provided for the dataset (such as a Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) or a handle), for all author(s) involved in the action (such as ORCIDs or
ResearcherIDs) and, if possible, for their organisations (such as ROR IDs) and the grant
(such as grant DOIs).
All the above provisions regarding research data management are also recommended for
research outputs other than scientific publications and research data.
Beneficiaries (or researchers, where the case) should retain sufficient intellectual property
rights to comply with the research data management requirements and to follow the research
output management recommendations.
8. Open science: Additional open science practices (HE)
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional obligations regarding open
science practices, those obligations must also be complied with.
Such open science practices can include, where relevant, early and open sharing of research
(for example, through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, or crowd-sourcing);
research output management (beyond publications and data); measures to ensure
reproducibility of research outputs; providing open access to research outputs beyond
publications and research data (for example software, models, algorithms, and workflows);
participation in open peer-review; and involving all relevant knowledge actors including
citizens, civil society and end users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as
citizen science).
Specific cases (open science):
Additional obligations regarding validation of scientific publications — If provided for
in the work programme/call conditions, beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access
to data or other results needed for the validation of the conclusions of scientific publications,
to the extent that their legitimate interests are safeguarded and constraints are taken into
account (for example through agreements with relevant confidentiality provisions) and unless
they already provided the (open) access at the time of publication.
392EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Additional obligations regarding open science in public emergencies — If the public
emergency provisions apply and can be activated on request of the granting authority (see
above for more explanations on additional exploitation obligations in case of public
emergencies), the requirement regarding immediate open access is extended beyond
publications, i.e. to any research outputs as follows:
− Beneficiaries must immediately deposit any research output in a repository and
provide open access to it under the latest version of a CC BY licence or having
released it via a Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or equivalent. Immediate means
that deposition of the research outputs must take place as soon as feasible, taking
into consideration the urgent nature of public emergencies and the care for the public
good.
− As an exception, if providing open access would be against their legitimate interests,
the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable
conditions — to legal entities that need the research output to address the public
emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and
services on fair and reasonable conditions. This obligation will apply for a period of
time specified in the request and up to four years after the end of the action. The
duration of this obligation and the fairness and reasonability of the licences will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the specific circumstances of the
public emergency, the context of each project and the nature of its results.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
In addition to the requirements regarding data management plans (DMPs) outlined above, in
the case of a public emergency for which the granting authority has activated the provision
by a request made at the stage of the work programme/call conditions, the beneficiaries
should provide a DMP preferably with the proposal or at the latest before grant signature.
The work programme/call conditions may provide for additional obligations in this regard.
For more guidance on open science practices and how to incorporate them in the action see the
HE Programme Guide.
9. Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication
activities
Unless the work programme/call conditions explicitly state otherwise, proposals must include
a first version of the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including
communication activities. A more detailed plan will then need to be provided as mandatory
project deliverable (normally within 6 months after grant signature).
The ‘plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities’
is a document that details the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that
will be carried out in the project to achieve the expected impact.
All measures described in the plan should be proportionate to the scale of the project, and
should contain concrete actions to be implemented. Where relevant (and in particular for HE
Innovation Actions), the measures should describe a plausible path to commercialise the
393EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
innovations. If exploitation is expected primarily in non-associated third countries, justify by
explaining how that exploitation is still in the EU interest.
This plan must be updated as required under the Grant Agreement (at least once before the
end of the project), in alignment with the project’s progress. Changes on the dissemination,
exploitation and communication activities can be introduced through the Portal Continuous
Reporting tool. The last version of the plan before the end of the project must include the
dissemination and exploitation activities that the beneficiaries plan to implement in a period
up to 4 years after the end the project.
During that period, beneficiaries must continue reporting on the progress of their activities
and on the project results through the Portal Continuous Reporting tool, which will remain
accessible.

1. Specific rules for carrying out the action (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules for carrying out the actions.
Some of these additional rules are standardised (i.e. based on a similar text, e.g. specific
rules for public procurement actions, specific rules for financial support to third parties
(FSTP), specific rules for blending operations, etc). Others are completely customised and
programme-specific (e.g. specific rules for humanitarian aid operations (HUMA), specific rules
for ESF actions (ESF), specific rules for information and promotion campaigns for agricultural
products (AGRIP)).

Implementation in case of restrictions due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU
and its Member States
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security, the beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated
partners, [third parties giving in-kind contributions,] subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third
parties are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) —unless
otherwise agreed with the granting authority.The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation
with entities established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect
the strategic assets, interests, autonomy or securityof the EU and its Member States.

1. Specific rules for the participation in case of restrictions due to strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States (restricted
calls) (HE)
Where the work programme/call conditions restrict participation due to strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security (so-called ‘restricted calls’), the beneficiaries must ensure
that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners,
subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) are established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or,
if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless
otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
If applicable (and unless the work programme/call conditions provide otherwise),
beneficiaries should provide the necessary justification why the involvement of such entities
is needed. Thus, if already known at the time of submission, the proposals must clearly
indicate that they will involve such entities, i.e. identify (if possible) the entities concerned
and justify why their involvement is needed.
The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation with entities established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or,
if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect
the strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States. This
includes but is not limited to cooperations that could negatively impact the protection and
exploitation of the results.

Recruitment and working conditions for researchers
The beneficiaries must take all measures to implement the principles set out in Annex II to the Council
Recommendation on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial
talents in Europe60 (from now on ‘the European Charter for Researchers’), in particular regarding:
- working conditions
- transparent recruitment processes based on merit, and
- career development.
The beneficiaries must ensure that researchers and all participants involved in the action are aware of them.

Horizon Europe and RFCS actions.
2. Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for their Recruitment —
Recruitment, working conditions and career development — Rights for the
researchers (HE, RFCS)
According to these rules, the beneficiaries must take all measures to implement the principles
set out in the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for their
Recruitment55.
The Charter provides a framework for researchers’ activities and career management, and
includes obligations for researchers, employers and funders. The Code of Conduct provides
for transparency to the recruitment and selection process, ensuring the equal treatment of all
applicants. It includes obligations for employers and funders.
55 Commission Recommendation 2005/251/EC of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on
a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75/67 , 22.3.2005, p. 67).
397EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific
steps to address conflicts between their policies and practices and the principles set out in the
European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken and measures put in place (see Article 20).
The granting authority will verify compliance with this obligation, when monitoring the action
implementation and in case of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 25).
The beneficiaries must in particular implement the general principles and requirements from
that relate to recruitment, working conditions and career development.
List of principles (relating to recruitment):
▪ Recruitment
▪ Transparency
▪ Judging merit
▪ Selection
▪ Variations in the chronological order of CVs
▪ Recognition of mobility experience
▪ Recognition of qualifications
▪ Seniority
▪ Postdoctoral appointments
List of principles (relating to working conditions):
▪ Research freedom
▪ Accountability
▪ Non-discrimination
▪ Working conditions
▪ Research environment
▪ Funding and salaries (in particular, adequate social security)
▪ Stability and permanence of employment
▪ Gender balance
▪ Intellectual property rights
▪ Complaints/appeals and
▪ Participation in decision-making bodies.
List of principles (relating to career development):
▪ Career development
▪ Access to research training and continuous development (independently of the
researcher’s status)
398EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Value of mobility
▪ Access to career advice
▪ Supervision
▪ Evaluation/appraisal systems.
The principles relating to recruitments imply that beneficiaries should have a clear policy for
recruiting and selecting researchers, which is publicly available and ensures that:
− all research vacancies and funding opportunities are publicly advertised (e.g. via the
EURAXESS Jobs Portal56)
− vacancies and funding opportunities are also published in English
− vacancy announcements include a clear job description
− vacancy announcements include the requirements for the position or the funding
opportunity, and the selection criteria
− there is an appropriate time period left between publication and the deadline for
applications
− there are clear rules for the composition of the selection panels (e.g. number and role
of members, inclusion of experts from other (foreign) institutions, gender balance)
− adequate feedback is given to applicants
− there is a complaint mechanism
− the selection criteria adequately value mobility, qualifications and experience,
including qualifications and experience obtained in non-standard or informal ways.
These principles also apply to selection procedures that do not lead to formal employment
relationship (e.g. award of a research fellowship).

Specific rules for access to research infrastructure (HE)
[OPTION for all HE and Euratom ToA (except HE IA, HE PCP/PPI, HE ERC Grants, HE EIC Grants and
HE EIT KIC Actions): Specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities
Definitions
Research Infrastructures —Facilities that provide resources andservices for the research communities to
conduct research and foster innovation in their fields. This definition includes the associated
human resources, and it covers major equipment or sets of instruments; knowledge-related
facilities such as collections, archives or scientific data infrastructures; computing systems,
communication networks, and any other infrastructure, of a unique nature and open to
external users, essential to achieve excellence in research and innovation. Where relevant,
they may be used beyond research, for example for education or public services, and they
may be ‘single-sited’, ‘virtual’ or ‘distributed’61:
When implementing access to research infrastructure activities, the beneficiaries must respect the following
conditions:
- for transnational access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, transnational access to research infrastructure or
installations for selected user-groups.
The access must include the logistical, technological and scientific support and the specific
training that is usually provided to external researchers using the infrastructure.
Transnational access can be either in person (hands-on), provided to selected users that visit
the installation to make use of it, or remote, through the provision to selected user-groups of
remote scientific services (e.g. provision of reference materials or samples, remote access to
a high-performance computing facility).
- categories of users that may have access:
Transnational access must be provided to selected user-groups, i.e. teams of one or more
researchers (users).
The majority of the users must work in a country other than the country(ies) where the
installation is located (unless access is provided by an international organisation, the Joint
Research Centre (JRC), an ERIC or similar legal entity).
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they have generated under the
action may benefit from the access (unless the users are working for SMEs).
Access for user groups with a majority ofusers not working in a EU Member State or
Horizon Europe associated countryis limited to 20% of the total amount of units of access
provided under the grant (unless a higher percentage is foreseen in Annex 1).
- procedure and criteria for selecting user groups:
The user groups must request access by submitting (in writing) a description of the work
that they wish to carry out and the names, nationalities and home institutions of the users.
The user groups must be selected by (one or more) selection panels set up by the
consortium.
The selection panels must be composed of international experts in the field, at least half of
them independent from the consortium (unless otherwise specified in Annex 1).
The selection panels must assess all proposals received and recommend a short-list of the
user groups that should benefit from access.
The selection panels must base their selection on scientific merit, taking into account that
priority should be given to user groups composed of users who:
61 See Article 2(1) of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme Regulation 2021/695.
400EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- have not previously used the installation and
- are working in countries where no equivalent research infrastructure exist.
It will apply the principles of transparency, fairness and impartiality.
Where the call conditions impose additional rules for the selection of user groups,the
beneficiaries must also comply with those.
- other conditions:
The beneficiaries must request written approval from the granting authority for the selection
of user groups requiring visits to the installations exceeding 3 months (unless such visits are
foreseen in Annex 1).
In addition, the beneficiaries must:
- advertise widely, including on a their websites, the access offered under the Agreement
- promote equal opportunities in advertising the access and take into account the gender
dimension when defining the support provided to users
- ensure that users comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement
- ensure that its obligations under Articles 12, 13, 17 and 33 also apply to the users
- keep records of the names, nationalities, and home institutions of users, as well as the
nature and quantity of access provided to them
- for virtual access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, virtual access to research infrastructure or installations.
‘Virtual access’ means open and free access through communication networks to digital
resources and services needed for research, without selecting the users to whom access is
provided.
The access must include the support that is usually provided to external users.
Where allowed by the call conditions, beneficiaries may in justified cases define objective
eligibility criteria (e.g. affiliation to a research or academic institution) for specific users.
- other conditions:
The beneficiaries must have the virtual access services assessed periodically by a board
composed of international experts in the field, at least half of whom must be independent from
the consortium (unless otherwise specified in Annex 1). For this purpose, information and
statistics on the users and the nature and quantity of the access provided, must be made
available to the board.
The beneficiaries must advertise widely, including on a dedicated website, the access offered
under the grant and the eligibility criteria, if any.
Where the call conditions impose additional traceability62 obligations, information on the
traceability of the users and the nature and quantity of access must be provided by the
beneficiaries.
These obligations apply regardless of the form of funding or budget categories used to declare the costs (unit
costs or actual costs or a combination of the two).]
62 According to the definition given in ISO 9000, i.e.: “Traceability is the ability to trace the history, application, use and
location of an item or its characteristics through recorded identification data.”The users can be traced, for example, by
authentication and/or by authorization or by other means that allows for analysis of the type of users and the nature and quantity
of access provided.
401EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities (HE)
The specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities apply to Horizon Europe
actions involving transnational and/or virtual access to research infrastructure for scientific
communities (in particular calls under Part III of the HE Work Programme, ‘Research
infrastructures’).
The specific rules in Annex 5 apply independently of the cost form chosen by the
beneficiary (unit cost or actual cost; see Article 6.2.D.3 and 6.2.D.4).
2. Transnational access to research infrastructure (HE)
Grants including this type of activity usually reimburse — for the provision of transnational
access — the following types of costs:
− ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the research infrastructure or installation and
costs related to logistical, technological and scientific support for users, including ad-
hoc user training and the preparatory and closing activities needed to use the
installation)
− ‘users’ travel and subsistence costs
− costs of advertising the transnational access offered under the action
− costs related to the selection procedure (e.g. the selection panel members’ travel and
subsistence costs, logistical costs of meetings, fees, etc.)
− costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the
periodic technical reports. For this purpose, beneficiaries should keep records of the
names, nationalities and home institutions of users, as well as the nature and quantity
of access provided to them.
‘Installation’ means a part or a service of a research infrastructure that could be used
independently from the rest. A research infrastructure consists of one or more installations.
The access costs (first indent) may be declared as unit costs, actual costs or — under certain
conditions — as a combination of the two (see HE RI authorising decision57), while the other
costs in this list (users’ travel and subsistence, advertisement, selection, reporting, etc) must
be declared as actual costs (see Article 6).
If the access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget
category 6.2.D.3 Transnational access to research infrastructure unit costs. They must fulfil
the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for that budget category (see
Article 6.2.D.3).
If they are declared as actual costs, they must be declared under the other budget categories
(see Article 6). They must fulfil the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for
57 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
402EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
the type of cost in question (e.g. costs for other goods and services must also fulfil the
specific eligibility conditions for the cost category C.3 Other goods, works and services).
Capital investments (i.e. equipment costs for renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable
equipment, infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed , unless provided for in the
work programme/call conditions (see also Article 6.2.D.3).
Transnational access must be measured (in ‘units of access’).
The units of access for the various installations must be specified in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. A unit of access will always be specified for each installation (regardless whether
the access costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs).
Examples (units of access): Per beam-hour for a synchrotron; per night for a telescope; per
number of frozen embryos for a mouse repository; per week of access for a historical archive; per
campaign-day for a research vessel.
Detailed information on the provision of access activity must be described in the periodic
technical reports.
Record-keeping — The beneficiaries must keep appropriate records and supporting
documentation to justify the number of units of transnational access for which they declare costs,
including:
− users’ names, nationalities and home institutions
− the nature and quantity of access and provided to them
− the number of units of access provided.
This information must be included in the periodic reports to the granting authority.
3. Transnational access which must be provided (HE)
Transnational access can be either:
− in person (hands-on), provided to selected users that visit the installation or
− remote, through the provision to selected users of remote scientific services.
Remote transnational access requires competitive selection of the users to be served under
the Grant Agreement, since it always applies to resources that are not unlimited (e.g.
computing hours on a supercomputer or remote analysis of a sample). It is thus different
from virtual access, for which selection of users is NOT required.
Examples (remote access): provision of reference materials or samples (e.g. shipping of a virus
strain); performing a remote sample analysis or sample deposition; remote access to a high-
performance computing facility.
Transnational access must be given to selected user groups (free of charge).
4. Categories of users that may have transnational access — Limited access for
special user groups (HE)
For transnational access, the majority of the users, in a user team applying for access, must
work in a country other than the country(ies) where the installation is located (— unless
access is provided by an international organisation, the European Commission Joint Research
Centre (JRC), a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) or similar legal entity
with international membership).
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they will generate under the
action may benefit from the access (— unless the users are working for SMEs).
403EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
User groups in which all or most users work in non-associated third countries may ONLY
have access for up to 20 % of the total number of units of access provided under the grant.
The consortium should itself define whether this 20% limit is uniformly applied to the
different installations or some installations may be used more than others. This should be
done in the consortium agreement.
Specific cases (transnational access to research infrastructure):
Distributed research infrastructure — In the case of distributed research infrastructures,
the exemption for the user origin/location applies to ALL installations providing services under
the umbrella of the research infrastructure (e.g. the ERIC), even if owned/operated by a
different legal entity (e.g. local/national node of an ERIC). In this case, all concerned
installations must be clearly listed in the proposal as being part of the same research
infrastructure benefitting from the exemption (e.g. the ERIC) and the distributed research
infrastructure (e.g. ERIC) must be a beneficiary. Beneficiaries must keep evidence that the
access to these installations or to their services are part of the offer of the distributed
infrastructure (e.g. service level agreements, other agreements).
With regard to related installations operated by another legal entity (e.g. local/national node
of an ERIC), this legal entity participate as:
- an affiliated entity to the research infrastructure
- another beneficiary if also carrying out other tasks in the project not under the
umbrella of the research infrastructure
- a third party to which the research infrastructure is purchasing access services
excluding any profit margin (see Article 6.2.C)
- a third party providing in-kind contributions free of charge
depending on the statutes of the research infrastructure, the agreements with its
nodes, the expected level of use of the concerned installations and any other relevant
implementation aspects.
5. Selection procedure with a selection panel (transnational access) (HE)
For transnational access, access providers must set up a common selection panel that
regularly evaluates the applications for access and recommends a shortlist of the user groups
that will benefit from access.
If justified, access providers may use several different selection sub-panels.
Example: Different thematic selection sub-panels could be set up for a set of analytical facilities
serving multidisciplinary communities.
6. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to users — Controls,
impact evaluation (transnational access) (HE)
The beneficiaries must ensure that users comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant
Agreement.
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are respected by the
users (e.g. through the agreement for the use of the research infrastructure, i.e. Terms and
conditions for use).
They cover in particular the obligations regarding controls and assessment. Thus, the
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA)
and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits
404EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
and investigations on the users (see Article 25), and in particular to audit proper
implementation of action tasks. If access is denied by the user, the costs will be rejected.
They must also ensure that the granting authority has the right to make an evaluation of the
impact of the action under Article 26.
7. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to users — Conflicts of
interest, confidentiality, visibility, liability (transnational access) (HE)
For transnational access, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the users comply with
certain other obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Obligations that must be extended to users:
▪ Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13)
▪ Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17)
▪ Liability for damages (see Article 33).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
users.
8. Virtual access to research infrastructure (HE)
Virtual access applies to digital resources and services needed for research that are available
through communication networks.
Grants including this type of activity usually reimburse — for the provision of virtual access—
the following types of costs:
− ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the installation during the course of the
action and costs related to technological and scientific support for users access (e.g. a
helpdesk)
− costs of advertising virtual access offered under the action
− costs related to the assessment carried out by the board of international experts (e.g.
costs of organising a board meeting)
− costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the
periodic technical reports and the assessment report (see below point 3).
The access costs (first indent) may be declared as unit costs, actual costs or — under certain
conditions — as a combination of the two (see HE RI authorising decision58), while the other
costs in this list (users’ travel and subsistence, advertisement, selection, reporting, etc) must
be declared as actual costs (see Article 6).
If the access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget
category 6.2.D.4 Virtual access to research infrastructure unit costs. They must fulfil the
general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for that budget category (see Article
6.2.D.4).
58 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
405EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If they are declared as actual costs, they must be declared under the other budget categories
(see Article 6). They must fulfil the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for
the type of cost in question (e.g. costs for other goods and services must also fulfil the
specific eligibility conditions for the cost category C.3 Other goods, works and services).
Capital investments (i.e. costs of renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable equipment,
infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed, unless provided for in the work
programme/call conditions (see also Article 6.2.D.4). In this case only the portion used to
provide virtual access under the project is eligible.
Virtual access must be measured (in ‘units of access’).
The units of access for the various installations be specified in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. A unit of access will always be specified for each installation (regardless whether
the access costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs).
When allowed by the call conditions and in well justified cases, the grant proposal can also
define objective eligibility criteria (e.g. affiliation to a research or academic institution) for the
users to whom access will be provided under the grant.
Detailed information on the provision of access activity must be described in the periodic
technical reports, including statistics on all users in the reporting period compiled through
web analytical tools.
9. Virtual access which must be provided (HE)
Since virtual access applies to digital resources and services available through communication
networks (i.e. resources that are unlimited available), the users do NOT have to undergo a
formalised selection procedure (this, together with the transnationality of users, is the main
difference between virtual and transnational access).
Access provided must be free of charge for users.
Example: Access to a database available on the internet.
10. Periodic assessment by a board of international experts (virtual access) (HE)
For virtual access, the access services must be regularly assessed by a board of international
experts, at least half of whom must be independent from the consortium (unless otherwise
specified in Annex 1).
At least two assessments are usually carried out during the course of an action.
The assessment reports must already be foreseen in the proposal (as deliverables; see HE RI
application form) and be included in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement.
406EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Annex 5 > HE PCP and PPI procurements
Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements (HE)
[OPTION for HE PCP-PPI: Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements
When implementing procurements in Pre-commercial Procurement (PCP) or Public Procurement of Innovative
Solution (PPI) actions,the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination,
equal treatment, sound financial management,proportionality and competition rules
- assign the ownership of the intellectual property rights under the contracts to the contractors (for PPI
procurements: unless there are exceptional overriding public interests which are duly justified in
Annex 1), with the right of the buyers to access results —on a royalty-free basis—for their own use
and to grant (or to require the contractors to grant) non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the
results for them —under fair and reasonable conditions —without any right to sub-license
- allow for all communications to be made in English (and any additional languages chosen by the
beneficiaries)
- ensure that prior information notices, contract notices and contract award notices contain information
on the EU funding and a disclaimer that the EU is not participating as contracting authority in the
procurement
- allow for the award of multiple procurement contracts within the same procedure (multiple sourcing)
- for procurements involving classified information: apply the security rules set outin Annex 5 mutatis
mutandis to the contractors and the background and results of the contracts
- where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons: apply the restrictions set out in Annex 5 mutatis mutandis to the contractors and the
results under the contracts
- where the call conditions impose a place of performance obligation: ensure that the part of the
activities that is subject to the place of performance obligation is performed in the eligible countries or
target countries set out in the call conditions
- to ensure reciprocal level of market access: where the WTO Government Procurement Agreement
(GPA) does not apply, ensure that the participation in tendering procedures is open onequal terms to
bidders from EU Member States and all countries with which the EU has an agreement in the field of
public procurement under the conditions laid down in that agreement, including all Horizon Europe
associated countries. Where the WTO GPA applies, ensure that tendering procedures are also open to
bidders from states that have ratified this agreement, under the conditions laid down therein. ]
1. Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements (HE)
These specific provisions apply to HE PCP and PPI types of action (i.e. calls with PCP/PPI
ToA).
They summarise the key requirements from General Annex H of the HE Work Programme for
the beneficiaries that are part of the buyers group (procurers).
407EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Formally speaking, the Annex 5 provisions apply ONLY for calls that run as PCP/PPI type
of action (i.e. where also the specific cost category in Article 6.2.D.5 applies).
Other types of calls (RIA, IA, CSA, etc) are NOT subject to Annex 5 (nor to Article
6.2.D.5) —even if projects should include PCP or PPI activities. For them, the PCP/PPI
activities must be handled as subcontracting in accordance with Article 6.2.B and Article
9.3.
However, for BOTH groups, the detailed provisions in General Annex H of the HE Work
Programme apply. If you plan to implement PCP or PPI activities in a Horizon Europe action,
you should therefore always first look at the General Annex.
2. Conflict of interest (HE)
The beneficiaries must avoid potential conflicts of interest in the preparation and
implementation of PCP/PPI procurements.
‘Conflict of interests’ means any situation where the impartial and objective implementation
of the Agreement could be compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life, political
or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect interest (see Article 12).
Therefore, entities that could have a potential conflict of interest with the PCP/PPI
procurement should in principle NOT be involved in the EU grant.
Thus, for instance potential providers of solutions can NOT participate as beneficiaries,
affiliated entities or associated partners in the EU grant. They can also NOT be used as
external experts, consultants or subcontractors for tasks to help prepare and/or manage the
PCP/PPI procurement (e.g. tasks for preparing the open market consultation and/or tender
specifications, evaluation of tenders, management of the procurement procedure).
Entities that are not potential providers, but which represent such providers (e.g. industry /
research associations or funding agencies, standardisation fora / bodies) can participate but
must take specific measures to ensure avoidance of conflict of interest. They must, for
instance, ensure that:
− the activities are performed in an impartial, independent way by their own staff (not
by staff of the providers)
− any interactions with providers are done in a non-discriminatory way (ensuring equal
treatment of ‘all’ providers, without giving any preferential treatment to those
providers that are represented by the entity).
3. Transparency — Communications in English — Equal treatment and non-
discrimination of tenderers and providers (HE)
The beneficiaries must comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and
equal treatment.
The transparency requirements apply both before, during and after the end of the PCP/PPI
procurement. They aim to ensure that all potentially interested providers are informed well
in advance to be able to make an offer and to disseminate the results of the PCP/PPI
procurement in line with the Horizon Europe policy on dissemination.
The public procurers must, in particular:
− publish prior information notices for the open market consultation (PINs), contract
notices and contract award notices in the OJEU (TED)
408EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− at the end of the PCP/PPI tender evaluation (for PCP, also for each phase) provide to
the granting authority:
− information on the total number of bids received, winning tenderer(s) and
abstracts of their project(s) (template) — public deliverable; will be published by
the granting authority
− final ranking list of the selected projects, final scores and qualitative assessment
per criterion for each bid received, minutes of the evaluation meeting — non-
public deliverable
− at the end of the action:
− give a demonstration to the granting authority of the tested solutions (PCP),
respectively the deployed innovative solution(s) (PPI)
− assessment by the procurers of the results achieved by each tenderer (for PCPs,
also after each phase) (template) — public deliverable; will be published by the
granting authority
Additional requirements for the PINs, contract notice and contract award notices (including
timing and exceptions) are set out in the General Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
Regarding deadlines for publication of notices, we will consider as the ‘date of publication’ the
date when you submitted the notice to the OJEU Publication Office.
In order to foster wide participation of potential providers from across Europe, the
procurement procedure must be done at least in English. In addition to English, you can also
choose to allow other languages.
This obligation applies not only to the language(s) used by the public procurers for
publication of the PINs, contract notice and contract award notice, the tender specifications
and contracts, but also to the language(s) that tenderers are allowed to use for the
submission of questions and offers.
Additional transparency requirements (including timing and exceptions) are set out in General
Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
The beneficiaries must ensure non-discrimination and equal treatment of all tenderers,
throughout the preparation and implementation of the procurement.
They must pay particular attention to:
− keep market consultations open to all tenderers
− evaluate all offers according to the same objective criteria, regardless of the
geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of the tenderers
It is therefore NOT possible to restrict the access or give preferential access to:
− tenderers from your specific country, region or city
− startups or SME type solution providers
− tenderers with a specific governance structure (e.g. stock listed vs non-stocklisted
companies, foundations, NGOs, research organisations, etc).
− not to provide information in a discriminatory manner that may give some
tenderers/providers an advantage over others
409EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− not to reveal confidential information communicated by a tenderer/provider without
their explicit agreement.
This can be ensured by including appropriate provisions for communication and
confidentiality of information in the open market consultation and call for tender
documents.
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
4. Intellectual property rights (HE)
Results generated by the beneficiaries follow the standard rules on IPR in Article 16 and
Annex 5.
For results generated by PCP/PPI procurement providers, the ownership of the IPR must
be assigned to the providers (for PPI procurements: unless there are exceptional overriding
public interests which are duly justified in the DoA Annex 1).
For PCP procurements, the beneficiaries must reserve the rights to:
− enjoy royalty-free access rights to the R&D results for their own use
− grant themselves (or to require the providers to grant) non-exclusive licences to third
parties, to exploit the results for them under fair and reasonable market conditions,
without any right to sub-license
This right serves as a safeguard to ensure continuity of service and a competitive
supply chain (during or after the action). It does NOT mean that every PCP provider
will always and automatically be obliged to grant licences to third parties to exploit the
results.
Example (licences needed): Other providers working for the procurers need access to the
IPR to work for the procurers. A PCP provider abuses its monopoly situation in the
commercialisation of products resulting from the PCP and, in order to ensure a competitive
supply chain, the procurers need another provider on the market to be able to supply them the
products.
The right is only allocated to the procurers (not to third parties directly) and only
applies to cases when licensing to third parties is needed to exploit the results ‘for the
procurers’ (not for other potential customers). Therefore, the provision does NOT give
competitors of the PCP providers any rights to require the procurers and/or PCP
providers to grant them licences to exploit the results. The provision also does NOT
give the procurers any rights to grant (or require the PCP providers to grant) licences
to third parties to exploit the results for ‘other markets’ beyond the procurers. The
licensing must ensure also that the PCP provider is financially compensated under fair
and reasonable market conditions.
− require the provider to transfer ownership of the results to them, if the provider uses
the results to the detriment of the public interest (including security interests) or fails
to commercially exploit the results within a given period after the PCP as fixed in the
PCP contract (call back provision)
This right serves as a safeguard to prevent abuse of results and ensure commercial
exploitation of results in the public interest, in case the PCP providers fail to do so
themselves. It can be exercised after consultation with the PCP on the reasons for why
this happened. By obtaining the IPR ownership, the public procurers can ensure
410EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
commercial exploitation of the results in line with the public interest. It will be for
exceptional cases.
Example (call-back needed): A PCP provider is winding up its business or decides to stop the
production line that commercialises the PCP results. A PCP provider abuses security related
results, for example to hack public services.
− to publish public summaries of the results of the PCP procurement, including
information about key R&D results attained and lessons learnt (e.g. on the feasibility
of the solution approaches to meet the requirements and lessons learnt for potential
future deployment of solutions).
Details that would be contrary to the public interest, would harm legitimate business
interests (e.g. regarding IPR-protected specificities of their individual approaches to
solutions) or could distort fair competition may not be disclosed.
To see what is normally published, see the templates for PCP-PPI Contractor details
and abstracts and End of phase and end of project results and conclusions for PCP-
PPI.
This allows to optimise the conditions for the PCP providers to pursue wide exploitation of
results and for the procurers to use the results without supplier lock-in, while ensuring that
the PCP procurement complies with the conditions for its exemption from the EU Public
Procurement Directives and from the international procurement agreements between the EU
and third countries.
If additional exploitation obligations apply, the beneficiaries must moreover ensure that the
PCP/PPI procurement call for tender documents comply with these obligations.
Example:
1. Due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions may require
that PCP/PPI providers commercialise the majority of the results in EU Member States.
2. Due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions may restrict
the participation to the action to entities that are established in (and controlled from) EU Member
States. Annex 5, stipulates that in the case, the beneficiaries (in particular the procurers carrying out
the PCP/PPI) as well as the PCP/PPI providers may NOT transfer ownership of their results or grant
licences to third parties which are not established (and, if applicable, are not controlled from) EU
Member States — unless they have requested and received prior approval by the granting authority.
Finally, for all PCP/PPI procurements, the allocation of the IPR to the providers must be
factored into the tender price. This will allow to obtain the best value for money price
according to market conditions (and rule out State aid).
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
5. Multiple sourcing (HE)
For PCP procurements, the use of multiple sourcing is obligatory, because pre-commercial
is per definition a procurement approach that awards multiple procurement contracts for R&D
services to multiple tenderers within the same procedure, in order to compare and test
potential alternative solution approaches from different providers in parallel.
For PPI procurements, the use of multiple sourcing is optional, unless the call conditions
explicitly require it. Although multiple sourcing requires higher upfront investment from the
buyers in terms of procurement budget and effort needed to monitor the contracts, multiple
sourcing can be useful for the deployment of solutions in PPIs for a number of reasons:
411EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− security reasons: multiple sourcing can be needed to guarantee the required security
levels and assurances in the supply of goods or services
− security of supply: multiple sourcing removes the dependency on only one supplier to
deliver all solutions and can guarantee that there is at all times security of supply of
sufficient solutions. This may be vital where a steady, reliable supply of
products/services is needed but the supply chain is fragile and the risk is too big to
rely on one supplier only to deliver all required solutions (e.g. supply of COVID
vaccines)
− strategic autonomy: multiple sourcing can reduce the dependency on non-European
providers for example by awarding the same contracts to both European and non-
European providers. This can be vital in situations of geopolitical tensions or
uncertainty
− continuity of service: solution/technology redundancy guarantees that if one solution
of one provider crashes/fails, another can immediately take over
Example: Since so many public services run these days on digital networks, ICT networks
typically install nodes from different competing providers and load balancing ensures that if
there is a technical failure in nodes from one provider, nodes from other providers that are
implemented differently can immediately take over the task and there is no service disruption.
− complementarity of solutions: when none of the solutions of different providers works
on its own in all circumstances, and the simultaneous deployment of different
solutions from different providers is needed to cover all the possible situations that
may occur
Example: If a harbour wants to track goods across the full supply route, solutions based on
sensors, camera’s, optical scanners, satellite images can all detect movement of goods in
different situations, but none of them covers all situations (indoor versus outdoor, short versus
long range, high versus low accuracy). If there is no provider on the market with and end-to-
end solution that can address all situations and requirements, the best way forward may be to
buy and install simultaneously different solutions that use alternative technologies from
different providers.
− better value for money: by awarding the same contract to multiple providers, the level
of competition is maximised. If the performance of one of the providers drops
significantly, the public buyer will immediately notice and there is no hurdle for him to
switch immediately to one of the other providers. If the performance of one provider
significantly increases, the buyer can immediately ask the other providers why they
are not performing at the same level. This competition can incentivize providers to
continue to improve their level of performance and reduce their prices over time in
order to remain among the best of the pack.
6. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to providers — Security
related obligations (HE)
Actions that involve security issues must apply the security rules set out in Annex 5 mutatis
mutandis to the PCP/PPI procurement providers, the background and results of the
PCP/PPI contracts.
These security rules will impact the preparation and implementation of the PCP/PPI. The
procurers must ensure that the whole process (market consultation, preparation of the tender
documents, evaluation of tenders, award and performance of the contracts) respects the
security rules.
For PCP/PPIs involving classified information, the beneficiaries need to ensure that
throughout the whole process all involved staff on the side of the participating providers,
subcontractors and procurers and other involved beneficiaries have the required security
412EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
clearances, and that all communications and deliverables are submitted and handled
according to the applicable rules for handling classified information.
In addition, the security rules may impact the procurement procedures in terms of limiting
the information that be disclosed (both in terms of IPR, deliverables of the procurement,
dissemination activities), limiting the providers that can participate (both to the market
consultation and the call for tenders) and limiting the allowed subcontracting. All these
aspects require also prior written explicit approval of the EU granting authority.
PCPs/PPIs involving dual-use goods or dangerous materials and substances must comply with
applicable EU, national and international law on handling these items, and the procurers must
ensure that PCP/PPI providers deliver them the required export or transfer licences.
In case the Grant Agreement includes security recommendations that affect the PCP/PPI
procurement, the beneficiaries must ensure that the open market consultation and tender
documents comply with the recommendation.
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
7. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to providers — Restrictions
on participation and/or control (HE)
If, due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions restrict
the participation to beneficiaries that are established in (and controlled from) eligible
countries, for example EU Member States only, , only procurers established in (and controlled
from) EU Member States are allowed to carry out the PCP/PPI procurement. Procurers
established in (and controlled from) third countries are NOT allowed to participate in the
action.
For such calls, the beneficiaries must apply the restrictions also to the contractors. For this,
the procurers must ensure that the PCP/PPI call for tender documents restrict participation to
bidders/providers established in the eligible countries. Other bidders/providers cannot
participate.
Example: Due to security reasons, the call conditions may require that the participation to the PPI
grants under the call is restricted to procurers from EU Member States (e.g. because the call
concerns solutions with potentially security sensitive products/solutions. The buyers group must
then incorporate provisions in its PPI call for tender documents that ensure that for the lots of the
PPI procurement that are concerned (i.e. involve the deployment of security sensitive
products/solution components), the participation is limited to bidders/providers that are
established in and controlled from EU Member States. For lots that are not concerned (i.e. do not
involve the deployment of security sensitive products/solution components), the participation
should remain open to providers from all countries with which the EU has an international
agreement on public procurement under the conditions provided by that agreement.
8. Place of performance obligation (HE)
Where the call conditions impose a place of performance obligation, the beneficiaries must
ensure that the part of the PCP/PPI procurement activities that is subject to the place of
performance obligation is performed (by the providers and their subcontractors) in the
eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions
413EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For PCP, a more general minimum condition regarding place of performance is also
set out in the General Annex H of the HE Work Programme, i.e. that the majority (i.e. at
least 50%) of the activities performed for the PCP contract as well as the principle R&D
staff must be located in EU Member States or HE associated countries.
The ‘activities performed for the PCP contract’ include R&D and operational activities (e.g.
research, development, testing, certifying solutions, etc).
The ‘principal R&D staff’ are the main researchers, developers and testers responsible for
leading the R&D activities covered by the contract.
For PPI, the minimum condition doesn’t apply since PPI procurements are typically
subject to the WTO GPA and other international procurement agreements.
Example (PCP): For projects in the field of security, the call conditions may specific for example
that 100% of the R&D work performed for the PCP contract on security components of the solution
as well as all the principle R&D staff working on security components must be located in the EU
Member States. The EU Member States are then the target countries for this additional place of
performance obligation. The procurers in the action must then ensure that their PCP call for tender
documents include not only the minimum place of performance obligation but also include the above
additional place of performance obligation. This will ensure that PCP providers and their
subcontractors implement minimum 50 % of all activities — including the non-security activities — of
the PCP in the EU Member States and HE associated countries and 100% of the R&D work for the
security components of the solution in the EU Member States.
Example (PPI): For projects in the field of security, the call conditions may specific for example
that 100% of the work for the PPI contract must be performed — and all the staff working on the PPI
contract must be located — in the EU Member States (or even in certain specific EU Member States).
The EU Member States listed in this obligation are then the target countries of this place of
performance obligation.
If a place of performance obligation applies, the beneficiaries must require PCP/PPI providers
to comply with it, including when they subcontract work.
The PCP/PPI call for tender documents and the procurement contract must clearly set out this
obligation and must require that it is passed on to subcontractors.
9. Market access for bidders from non EU countries — WTO GPA — International
agreements on public procurement (HE)
To ensure reciprocal level of market access, beneficiaries must ensure that where the WTO
Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) does not apply, the participation in tendering
procedures is open on equal terms to bidders from EU Member States and all countries with
which the EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement under the conditions laid
down in that agreement, including all HE associated countries. Where the WTO GPA applies,
ensure that tendering procedures are also open to bidders from states that have ratified this
agreement, under the conditions laid down therein.
PCP procurements are generally exempt from the WTO GPA and all other agreements on
public procurement between the EU and third countries because they are for R&D services
contracts (i.e. contracts with the objective to provide R&D services). Access to PCP
procurements can therefore be limited to PCP providers from the EU Member States and HE
associated countries (— and even restricted further in case of restricted calls due to strategic
assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons).
PPI procurements are generally not exempt from the WTO GPA and the other agreements
on public procurement between the EU and third countries. Access to PPI procurements must
therefore normally be open also to tenderers from third countries that are parties to the WTO
GPA or with whom the EU has an agreement on public procurement, under the conditions
specified in those agreements (— except for calls that are restricted due to strategic assets,
414EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
interests, autonomy or security reasons, provided that the restriction also falls under a
specific exemption in those agreements, e.g. exemptions for public security and public
health).
International agreements on public procurement usually also contain non-discrimination
obligations. Country of origin and other local content restrictions are thus only allowed in
PCP/PPI procurements if they fall under an exception/exemption of these agreements (e.g.
for PCPs: all PCPs are exempted, for PPIs: only limited exemptions exist, e.g. for security and
public health).
Example:
1. Due to the exceptional situation on public health created by the corona pandemic, COVID-19
vaccine procurement contracts may currently contain provisions requiring that vaccine production
takes place in the EU Member States and that essential components are sourced from the EU
Member States.
2. Due to exemptions for the utilities sector, public buyers in the utilities sector can reject tenders
for supply contracts when more than 50% of the products come from third countries with which the
EU does not have an international (WTO GPA or bilateral) agreement on public procurement.
3. Due to the exemption for PCP procurements, PCP procurements can require that essential
components for developing, testing and commercialising the solution are sourced from the EU
Member States and the countries associated to Horizon Europe as well as that the PCP providers
locate minimum 50% of the production of products and/or the provisioning of services that result
from the PCP in the EU Member States and the countries associated to Horizon Europe. If required,
e.g. due to security or public health reasons, this requirement could be restricted to EU Member
States.

[OPTION for HE and Euratom Programme Cofund actions: Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships
When implementing financial support to third parties in Co-funded Partnerships, the beneficiaries must respect
the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and
sound financial management
- for the types of activity and categories of persons that will be supported:
- for multi-beneficiary projects (including multi-participant projects): the projects supported
must be transnational, involving at least two independent legal entities from two different EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries as recipients of the financial support
and may also include legal entities established in a non-associated third countries not
receiving financial support
- for mono-beneficiary projects (multi-participant projects): the projects supported must be
transnational, involving one legal entity established in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe associated country as recipient of the financial support and one legal entity
established in a non-associated third country not receiving financial support
- for the selection procedure and criteria:
- publish open calls widely (including on the Funding & Tenders Portal and the beneficiaries’
websites)
- keep open calls open for at least two months
- inform recipients of call updates (if any) and the outcome of the call (list of selected projects,
amounts and names of selected recipients)
- measures to avoid potential conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants must be
ensured (notably through appropriate communication/exchange of information channels and
independent and fair complaints procedures)
- use the following selection criteria: the standard Horizon Europe award criteria
- use the following selection procedures:
- projects must be selected following a joint transnational call for proposals
- beneficiaries must make the selection through a two-step procedure:
- Step 1: review at national or transnational level (including national
eligibility checks)
- Step 2: single international peer review
and in Step 2:
- proposals must be evaluated with the assistance of at least three independent
experts
- proposals must be ranked according to the evaluation results and the
selection must be made on the basis of this ranking
- the selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer,
who must make a report.
416EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Where the financial support is implemented through implementing partners, the beneficiaries must:
- ensure that the partners comply with the same rules, standards and procedures for implementing the
financial support
- implement effective monitoring and oversight arrangements towards the partners, covering all aspects
relating to the action
- ensure effective and reliable reporting by the partners, covering the activities implemented,
information on indicators, as well as the legality and regularity of the expenditure claimed
- ensure that the partnersprovide that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF,
Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the final recipients
- where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons: apply the restrictions set out in Annex 5 mutatis mutandis to the final recipients and
their results.]
1. Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships (HE)
The specific rules (such as the participation of beneficiaries/affiliated entities as recipients of
FSTP) for Co-funded Partnerships apply to certain HE Programme Co-fund types of action
(i.e. calls with COFUND ToA). They replace the former Joint programming initiatives (JPIs),
European research area networks (ERA-NETs) and European Joint programmes (EJPs) Cofund
actions in Horizon 2020.
The Annex 5 provisions focus ONLY on the cascading scenario (i.e. where beneficiaries
provide financial support to third parties (FSTP); so-called ‘co-funded calls’). For
transnational projects implemented by the beneficiaries themselves (as part of the action),
the standard rules of the Grant Agreement apply.
Co-funded Partnerships are ALSO subject to the rules for recipients of financial support
(FSTP) in Article 9.4.
2. Providing financial support vs implementation of transnational projects by the
beneficiaries (HE)
A core part of Co-funded Partnerships is to provide financial support to third parties (i.e. pass
on the EU support they receive via the Co-funded Partnerships grant to recipients that are
not party to the Grant Agreement, also called ‘cascade funding’).
In this case, the beneficiaries’ activity consists in providing the financial support, while it is
the final recipients (‘third parties receiving financial support’) that actually implement the
projects.
Specific cases (co-funded partnerships):
FSTP between beneficiaries — Beneficiaries to the EU grant can in principle NOT also be
final recipient (since that is not the purpose of a cascading grant).
However, if explicitly permitted by the call conditions/Grant Agreement and included and
justified in the DoA Annex 1, there are cases where exceptions are permitted (i.e. where the
co-funded call can be opened also for entities that are also beneficiaries of the EU grant or
417EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
other departments of the beneficiary). In this case, the consortium will be asked during grant
preparation to:
- -propose a clear list of beneficiaries (or which department of a beneficiary, where
applicable) that will have the responsibility of drafting call texts, and managing the
award procedure
- -identify the beneficiaries (or other departments of the same beneficiary) which can
apply for funding under the co-funded call for proposals
- -explain the measures to mitigate (potential) conflict of interest or unequal treatment
of applicants (see information barriers below) and
- -reflect this fully in their DoA Annex 1, both in the context of the description of the co-
funded call and in relation to the monitoring of the transnational projects.
If needed, beneficiaries must set up information barriers (‘firewalls’) to prevent exchanges or
communication that could lead to conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants and
ensure independent and fair complaints procedures.
Costs can be declared ONLY by the beneficiary providing the financial support, NOT by the
final recipient receiving the financial support (even if it is at the same time beneficiary of the
grant and can therefore declare other costs).
3. Calls for transnational projects (HE)
The projects financed under the co-funded calls must be transnational, i.e. for Horizon co-
funded partnerships, they must involve:
− for multi-beneficiary projects (including multi-participant projects): at least two
independent legal entities from two different EU Member States or HE associated
countries which implement the project receiving financial support; in addition the
projects may also include legal entities from non-associated third countries not
receiving any financial support from the EU grant
OR
− for mono-beneficiary projects (multi-participant projects): one legal entity from an EU
Member State or HE associated country which implements the project with financial
support; in addition, to ensure their transnational nature, the projects must include at
least one legal entity established in a non-associated third country not receiving any
financial support from the EU grant.
Note that additional eligibility conditions may apply in specific cases concerning the minimum
number of independent entities (including entities from third countries).
For Euratom Co-funded Partnerships, references to ‘associated countries’ must be understood
as Euratom associated countries (not HE associated countries).
4. Award criteria (HE)
The evaluation in the co-funded calls must be done on the basis of the same award criteria
that are used for Horizon Europe calls, i.e.:
(a) Excellence
(b) Impact
(c) Quality and efficiency of the implementation.
418EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The aspects to be taken into account for each award criterion should also be the same used
for Horizon Europe proposals. Depending on the type of action, General Annex D of the HE
Work Programme should be applied.
5. Two-step selection procedure (HE)
The selection procedure of the co-funded calls must follow a two-step procedure, ensuring
for:
Step 1: review at national or transnational level (including national eligibility checks)
Step 2: single international peer review
and that in Step 2:
– proposals must be evaluated with the assistance of at least three independent
experts
– proposals must be ranked according to the evaluation results and the selection
must be made on the basis of this ranking
– the selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer, who
must make a report.
Only entities/consortia that are eligible for funding under BOTH Horizon Europe rules and
national funding rules should be invited to Step 2.
The co-funded calls and projects must in principle comply BOTH with the applicable
Horizon Europe and with the national funding rules of the beneficiaries.
Best practice: Where possible, the beneficiaries are however encouraged to harmonise the
national rules and implementation modalities for their transnational calls (e.g. by using only
Horizon Europe rules as common rules).
Consortia should be allowed to adjust the budget between Steps 1 and 2, in order to balance
the requested funding and available funding per participating EU Member State and HE
associated country.
6. Independent experts — Observers (HE)
In addition to using expert evaluators for the evaluation of the co-funded calls, the
beneficiaries must appoint, for each call, an independent expert as an observer to verify that
the selection procedure meets the requirements (in particular, for the peer review evaluation
and the ranking).
The observer’s report must be submitted by the coordinator, as part of the periodic report
(see Article 21.2).
7. Ranking list — Joint selection list (HE)
The beneficiaries must base their selection (joint selection list) on the order of the ranking list
(or the ranking lists, if there are different topics).
If proposals have identical scores, the proposals coming from participating EU Member States
or HE associated countries with still available funding can be given precedence, in order to
maximise the number of selected projects.
The ranking list(s) and the joint selection list must be submitted by the coordinator, as part
of the periodic report (see Article 21.2).
419EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
8. Project implementation — Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement
to final recipients (HE)
The implementation of the transnational projects by final recipients will follow in principle the
rules of the cascade grant agreements they sign with the beneficiaries (e.g. usually national
rules, but they can also decide to use Horizon Europe rules as common rules for those
agreements).
In all cases, the beneficiaries must ensure that the users comply with certain obligations from
the EU grant (see Article 9.4).
Obligations that must be extended to recipients:
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding as appropriate (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18)
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are respected by the final
recipients (e.g. through the cascade grant agreement).
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
recipients, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
recipient, the costs will be rejected.
420EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Annex 5 > HE ERC Grants
Specific rules for ERC Grants (HE)
[OPTION for HE ERC Grants: Specific rules for ERC Grants
When implementing ERC Grants, the beneficiaries must ensure that the action tasks described in Annex 1 are
performed under the guidance of the principal investigator.
In accordance with Article 21, beneficiaries must submit progress reports (scientific reports) and periodic
reports according to the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Points 4.1 and 4.2). Reports
must be prepared using the templates available in the Portal (ERC scientific and periodic reports).
The internal arrangements set out in Article 7 must cover the decision making procedures for scientific and
grant management issues, the distribution of the EU contribution, internal dispute settlement and division of
responsibilities for cases of rejection of costs or reduction of the grant.
In addition to the obligations set out in Article 17, communication and dissemination activities as well as
infrastructure, equipment or major results funded by the grant mustmoreover display the following special
logo:
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions for the principal investigator and their
team:
- host and engage the principal investigator for the whole duration of the action
- take all measures to implement the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers — in
particular regarding working conditions, transparent recruitment processes based on merit and career
development — and ensure that the principal investigator, researchers and third parties involved in the
action are aware of them
- enter — before grant signature — into a Supplementary Agreement with the principal investigator,
that specifies:
- the obligation of the beneficiary to meet its obligations under the Grant Agreement
- the obligation of the principal investigator to supervise the scientific and technological
implementation of the action
- the obligation of the principal investigator to assume the responsibility for the scientific
reporting for the beneficiary and contribute to the periodic reporting
- the obligation of the principal investigator to meet the time commitments for implementing
the action and for working in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe associated country, as
set out in Annex 1
- the obligation of the principal investigator to apply the beneficiary’s usual management
practices
421EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- the obligation of the principal investigator to inform the beneficiary immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect the Grant Agreement, such as:
- a planned portability of the grant (or part of it) to a new beneficiary (see Articles 32.2,
39, 40, 41)
- any personal grounds affecting the implementation of the action
- any changes in the information that was used as a basis for signing the supplementary
agreement
- any changes in the information that was used as a basis for awarding the grant
- the obligation of the principal investigator to ensure the visibility of EU funding in
communications or publications and in applications for the protection of results (see Article
16 and 17)
- the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights — during the implementation of
the action and afterwards —, in particular, the obligation of the principal investigator to
uphold the intellectual property rights of the beneficiary and full access — on a royalty-free
basis — for the principal investigator to background and results needed for their activities
under the action
- the obligation of the principal investigator to maintain confidentiality (see Article 13)
- for portability of the grant to a new beneficiary (see Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41):
- the right of the principal investigator to request the portability of the grant, provided that
the objectives of the action remain achievable
- the obligation of the principal investigator to:
- propose to the coordinator (in writing) to what extent the action will be transferred
and the details of the transfer arrangement
- provide a statement to the coordinator with the detailed results of the research up to
the time of transfer
- the right of the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court of
Auditors (ECA), etc.) to exercise their rights also towards the principal investigator
- the applicable law and the dispute settlement forum
- provide the principal investigator with a copy of the signed Agreement
- guarantee the principal investigator scientific independence, in particular for the:
- use of the budget to achieve the scientific objectives
- authority to publish as senior author and invite as co-authors those who have contributed
substantially to the work
- preparation of scientific reports for the action
- selection and supervision of the other team members, in line with the profiles needed to
conduct the research and in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual management practices
- possibility to apply independently for funding
- access to appropriate space and facilities for conducting the research
- provide — during the implementation of the action — research support to the principal investigator
and the team members (regarding infrastructure, equipment, access rights, products and other
services necessary for conducting the research)
- support the principal investigator and provide administrative assistance, in particular for the:
- general management of the work and their team
- scientific reporting, especially ensuring that the team members send their scientific results
to the principal investigator
422EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- periodic reporting, especially providing timely and clear financial information (for actual
costs)
- application of the beneficiary’s usual management practices
- general logistics of the action
- access to the electronic exchange system
- inform the principal investigator immediately (in writing) of any events or circumstances likely to
affect the Agreement
- ensure that the principal investigator enjoys adequate:
- conditions for annual, sickness and parental leave
- occupational health and safety standards
- insurance under the general social security scheme, such as pension rights
- allow (for both mono and multi-beneficiary actions) the portability of the grant to a new beneficiary,
if requested by the principal investigator and provided that the objectives of the action remain
achievable (see Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41). The beneficiary may object only on the basis that the
portability of the grant is not possible under national law. In particular, the beneficiary must:
- agree with the principal investigator and the new beneficiary on a plan for the transfer of the
intellectual property rights under the Agreement to the new beneficiary
- transfer to the new beneficiary any part of the pre-financing received which is not covered by
an approved periodic report, if requested by the granting authority
- transfer to the new beneficiary the equipment purchased and used exclusively for the action
— against reimbursement of the costs that have not yet been depreciated (for actual cost
grants) or under fair and reasonable conditions agreed among the concerned beneficiaries (for
lump sum grants) — if requested by the principal investigator and the granting authority, and
unless the transfer is not possible under national law.
For ERC Grants with more than one principal investigator, the above-mentioned obligations must be ensured
by each beneficiary towards their principal investigators and their teams (and by each principal investigator
towards their beneficiary, the coordinator and the other principal investigators). Moreover, the following
specificities must be observed:
- for the implementation of the action: the corresponding principal investigator bears the overall
responsibility for the supervision of the scientific and technological implementation of the action,
while the other principal investigators must contribute to the overall implementation and supervise
each one their parts
- for the reporting: the corresponding principal investigator assumes the primary responsibility for the
scientific reporting and contribution to the periodic reporting, while the other principal investigators
must contribute to both the scientific and periodic reporting
- for events or circumstances likely to affect the Agreement: each principal investigator must inform
the coordinator, their beneficiary and the other principal investigators
- for portability of the grant by one of the principal investigators (Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41):
- the corresponding principal investigator must verify that the beneficiary of the principal
investigator and the coordinator were informed
- the principal investigator concerned must provide the coordinator and their beneficiary with a
statement on the detailed results of the research up to the time of transfer
- for the internal arrangements (Article 7): they must also cover settlement of disputes between the
principal investigators and between them and the beneficiaries).
For ERC Proof of Concept Grants, the specific rules on reporting (scientific and periodic reporting) and the
special conditions for the principal investigator and their team do not apply.]
423EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Specific rules for ERC Grants (HE)
The specific rules for ERC Grants apply to all HE ERC types of action (i.e. calls with ERC ToA,
including ERC SyG and ERC PoC).
ERC types of action that use actual costs also have two special cost categories in
Article 6.2.D.7 and 6.2.D.8.
2. Actions under the guidance of the principal investigator (PI) (HE)
ERC Grants are designed to attract excellence in fundamental research and focus on principal
investigators (PIs).
PIs do not become party to the Grant Agreement, but they are the key actors, in charge of
the research activities. The host institution which hosts and engages the PI is the one that
must apply for the ERC Grant (and will act as coordinator, in case of multi-beneficiary
grants).
For ERC Synergy Grants (SyG), there might be several host institutions (beneficiaries
hosting and engaging a PI). In this case, the coordinator will be the entity hosting and
engaging the corresponding PI, who will be the administrative contact point for the group of
PIs.
The host institution becomes the signatory of the Grant Agreement and formally subscribes
to the legal and financial obligations under it.
The hosting institution must ensure that the action is performed under the guidance of the PI.
Due to the key role of the PI, they can NOT be replaced by any other researcher during the
action. Requests for amendments to change the PI will be rejected.
Combining ERC & other EU grants — ERC grants do NOT prevent PIs from applying
independently (i.e. in their own name) for further EU funding for other actions or for the same
action, but for costs that are not eligible (or not declared) under the ERC grant.
The fact that the funding rate for ERC grants is 100% does not mean that the grant pays for
100% of the costs of the ERC action. Therefore, cost items not declared under the ERC grant may
be covered by other EU funding.
2. Scientific and financial reporting (HE)
The ERC Grant Agreements set out different reporting periods for the financial and scientific
reporting.
The financial reporting corresponds to the periodic reporting in standard EU grants. The
scientific reporting is a special form of progress reporting.
The scientific reporting is done separately from the periodic reporting (i.e. in addition to the
financial reports which are needed to receive interim and final payments).
Normally, the two types of reports alternate between them. At the end of the action, they are
submitted together in a single periodic report, in order to receive the final payment.
For ERC Starting Grants, Consolidator Grants and Advanced Grants, where the usual duration
is 60 months, the first scientific report is submitted after 24 months, while the first periodic
(financial) report is submitted after 30 months. Depending on the overall duration of the
action the periodicity may change.
424EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For ERC Synergy Grants, where the normal duration is 72 months, the scientific reports are
expected at month 24, 48 and 72, whereas the periodic (financial) reports are expected at
month 18, 36, 54 and 72.
Scientific reports (progress reports):
The scientific reports must be submitted through the Portal (Scientific Reporting tool).
These scientific reports include:
– information about the scientific progress of the work
– the achievements and results of the action
– information on whether and how open access has been provided to the results
– information on how the results have been disseminated
– a summary of the achievements of the action, for publication by the granting
authority.
Financial reports (periodic reports):
The financial reports are available directly through the Portal (Periodic Reporting tool).
These financial reports include:
– an overview of the action implementation indicating in particular any significant
deviation in relation to the DoA Annex 1
– a narrative containing information on the eligible costs, including an explanation on
the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
– an individual financial statement
– a consolidated financial statement, created automatically by the IT system (on the
basis of all financial statements submitted by the beneficiaries and affiliated entities
for the reporting period), which counts as the request of payment
– the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (when required by the Grant
Agreement; see Article 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3).
3. Host and engage the PI (HE)
The principal investigator must be hosted and engaged by the host institution, for the whole
duration of the action.
This obligation is also an eligibility criterion for ERC actions. Like all eligibility criteria, it
must be fulfilled for the entire duration of the action (see Article 7) — otherwise the
action may have to be terminated (see Article 32).
Normally the PI will be employed by the host institution, but there may be cases where the
PI’s employer is a third party who makes the PI available to work for the host institution,
where the PI is self-employed, or where the PI has a particular status in the HI (e.g.
‘emeritus’).
The specific conditions of engagement (which normally should be similar to those of an
employee of the host institution) will be subject to clarification and approval by the granting
authority during the grant preparation (or in case of an amendment request).
425EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
4. Supplementary agreement (HE)
The host institution must — before grant signature — conclude a supplementary agreement
(SA) with the principal investigator.
The ‘Supplementary Agreement (SA)’ is an agreement between the host institution and the
principal investigator to set out their internal arrangements for implementing the grant and
govern their relationship during the ERC action.
The supplementary agreement is NOT intended to replace the employment/engagement
contract.
It should cover all the practical issues that may arise in the context of the grant
implementation and must remain in place at least for the action duration (— without any
interruptions). For ERC Synergy grants (i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs),
each host institution must conclude a supplementary agreement with the PI(s) it engages.
The supplementary agreement must be concluded before grant signature (or in case of
portability before submission of the amendment request) and have the following minimum
content:
Main obligations (towards the PI):
▪ Host and engage the PI for the whole duration of the action
▪ Scientific independence, to achieve the action’s objectives under the best possible
conditions, and within the time agreed
▪ Research support, to conduct the research as described in the Grant Agreement
▪ Access to and protection of intellectual property rights
▪ Adequate working conditions, always in accordance with national law and
institutional rules
▪ Administrative support, to manage the legal and financial aspect of the action
▪ Grant portability, allowing and facilitating the transfer of the grant to another host
institution.
Main obligations (of the PI):
▪ Supervision of the scientific and technological implementation of the action
▪ Responsibility for the scientific reporting and contribution to the financial reporting
▪ Meeting the time commitment for implementing the action (see below”)
▪ Applying the host institution’s usual management practices (in particular,
regarding the way the work is organised, the premises where it is carried out, and
the manner in which it is supervised)
▪ Informing the host institution immediately of any events or circumstances likely to
affect the Grant Agreement
▪ Ensure the visibility of EU funding
▪ Upholding the intellectual property rights of the beneficiaries
This obligation is not limited to respecting the host institution’s intellectual
property rights (IPRs). The PI must actively inform it, if they become aware of any
violations.
426EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: The PI reads a research article and discovers a violation of the host institution’s
project IPRs. They are obliged to inform the host institution.
▪ Maintaining confidentiality.
A template for a model supplementary agreement is available on the ERC website. The model
is not mandatory; beneficiaries may use other clauses, provided they benefit the research
action and do not contradict the Grant Agreement (e.g. if the supplementary agreement
contains additional provisions concerning intellectual property, they must allow the host
institution to comply with its obligations under Article 16 of the Grant Agreement).
The granting authority is NOT party to the supplementary agreement and has NO responsibility
for it (nor for any adverse consequences).
It must NOT contain any provisions contrary to the Grant Agreement. Contradicting provisions are
considered void and cannot be opposed to the granting authority.
5. PI time commitments (HE)
The host institution must make sure that the principal investigator ensures a sufficient time
commitment and presence throughout the action, to guarantee its proper implementation.
The host institution must in particular make sure that the PI complies with the minimum
requirements set out in the DoA Annex 1 regarding working time on the action and working
time in an EU Member State or HE associated country.
These two time commitment obligations are as follows:
- % of working time that the PI must work on the action
- % of working time that the PI must work in an EU Member State or HE associated
country.
To be operational, these two percentages must be translated into working days, i.e.:
- minimum number of days that the PI must work in the action over its duration
- minimum number of days that the PI must work in an EU Member State or HE
associated country over the duration of the action.
The calculation should be done as follows:
Step 1 — For each year of the action, the percentages of PI commitment are applied to
215 fixed annual days.
The 215 fixed annual days work as a ceiling: they apply even if the PI works in total
more days (i.e. has other parallel affiliations, freelance activities or work-related
obligations or works more days on the action). In this case, the time commitment is
capped at 100% and the days are calculated on the 215 fixed annual days.
By contrast, if the PI works in total less days than the 215 fixed annual days, the time
commitment obligation will be reduced proportionally (e.g. in cases of part-time
employment, maternity leave, sick leave…).
The total work of the PI will be determined by adding up all their days of remunerated
work, including under contracts with entities other than the host institution.
Example: The % of PI commitment to the ERC action is 50%. The PI works 129 annual days at
the host institution and has another contract with a different entity to work 35 days over the
year. The days that the PI works in total are 164 days (129 + 35). Since this amount is lower
than the 215 fixed annual days, the time commitment obligation will be: 164 x 50 % = 82 days
427EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 — Sum up the results for each year of Step 1 to get the total number of days over
the action duration.
The percentages must be reached for the overall action duration (NOT annually or per
reporting period).
The PI's time commitments obligations must ALWAYS be fulfilled — even if no personnel
costs are charged for them to the project.
6. Transfer of the GA (portability) (HE)
Portability means that the PIs have a right to request the transfer of their grant to a new host
institution — provided that the objectives of the action remain achievable and that the new
host institution meets the eligibility criteria set out in the ERC work programme/call
conditions.
Portability allows the PI to request the transfer of the entire grant or part of it, and it applies
both in case of mono-beneficiary grants and multi-beneficiary grants. In ERC Synergy Grants
(i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs), each PI has the right to transfer their part
of the action. They must inform and consult the other PIs, to ensure that the action’s
objectives can still be achieved.
ERC grants can thus be transferred to a new host institution (‘new beneficiary’) — at any time
during the action.
Transfers without a formal amendment are void and may result in grant termination. The
former host institution remains fully responsible until the granting authority has approved the
amendment.
The transfer may be based on any ground that is beneficial for the PI and does not affect the
achievement of the action’s objectives.
The transfer may be refused, if the objectives of the action do not remain achievable or if
there is an issue with eligibility (e.g. if the PI requests a transfer to an institution established
in a non-associated third country). In this case the Grant Agreement may be terminated (see
Article 32). Exceptions, in line with the applicable ERC work programme/call conditions, may
apply for ERC Synergy Grants.
In addition, the former host institution (‘former beneficiary’) may oppose a transfer if it is not
allowed under national law.
The transfer conditions (including transfer of team members, intellectual property rights and
equipment) should be negotiated with the new host institution, taking into account the views
of the PI.
Amendment procedure:
Portability transfers are done directly in the Portal Amendment tool as in/out amendment
(AT4 beneficiary termination is combined with AT1 Addition of a new beneficiary; see Article
39; new for 2021-2027).
The procedure is therefore in principle the one for consortium-initiated partner terminations
(see Article 32).
The PI should first contact the host institution that signed the Grant Agreement (i.e. the
former host institution).
Best practice: Both the beneficiaries and the PI should keep records of the consultation and
decision-making process for each portability case.
428EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The former host institution must submit a request for amendment to the granting authority
(see Article 39). The amendment should normally cover both the termination of the old host
institution and the addition of the new host institution.
The termination/addition may exceptionally (and in duly justified cases) not be necessary,
if the old host institution remains in the action as normal beneficiary (and the action becomes
a multi-beneficiary action), but in this case the amendment will have to do a change of
coordinator to change the roles (AT11).
The transfer date must be indicated in the amendment request. If the new host institution
joins the action, the transfer date must be the same date as the accession date. Retroactive
dates may be accepted only in exceptional cases, if duly justified.
In addition, the financial reporting periods may be adapted to match the transfer date (can
be done in the same amendment). The scientific reporting periods will usually remain
unchanged (since the transfer normally has no effect on the scientific implementation of the
action).
For more guidance on amendments, see the Amendment Guide and the Online Manual >
Amendments.
Effects:
The effects are also those of consortium-initiated partner terminations (see Article 32).
The host institution must — within 60 days from either the transfer date or the date of
signature of the amendment whichever is the latest — submit:
− a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned (only in case of
multi-beneficiary grants)
− a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate
on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
The documents will be used for calculating the next payment due to the former beneficiary.
The granting authority will moreover instruct the former host institution to transfer the
remaining pre-financing to the new host institution.
If the PI requests it, the granting authority may also require the former host institution to
transfer equipment that was purchased and used exclusively for the action.
The former host institution may oppose this only if it is not possible under national law. It
may however negotiate transfer conditions with the new host institution, taking into account
the views of the PI.
Thus, the new host institution should make its best effort to buy the equipment fully used for
the project. If it does so, it may declare the costs of this purchase (and any other related
costs, i.e. dismantling, transfer and installation), if they fulfil the eligibility conditions set out
in Article 6. In particular, the purchase price should not be higher than the net accounting
value of the equipment at the former host institution (i.e. initial value of the asset minus
depreciation incurred until the transfer).
Specific cases (ERC):
PI employed by a third party — The PI may be employed not by the host institution but by
a third party (from an EU Member State or HE associated country), i.e.:
− a third party that provides the PI as in-kind contribution or
429EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− an affiliated entity.
This must be specifically justified in the proposal (or amendment request) and included in the
DoA Annex 1.
In this case, the supplementary agreement should be signed by the PI, the host institution
and the third party employing the PI.
Retired PI — The PI may be retired. In this case, there must still be an ‘engagement’
relationship, comparable to an employment relationship, between the PI and the host
institution, ensuring that the PI will have the scientific independence and the necessary rights
to supervise the research and the team, and comply with the rights and obligations specified
in the Grant Agreement.
PI who is also the representative of the host institution— If the PI is at the same time
the representative of the host institution entitled to sign the supplementary agreement on
behalf of the host institution (because of their position in the institution), the supplementary
agreement must be counter-signed by another person empowered by the institution. The PI
can NOT sign their own supplementary agreement for both sides.
Portability — If the Grant Agreement is transferred to another host institution, a new
supplementary agreement must be signed with the new host institution. The new
supplementary agreement must take effect from the grant transfer date (or before). The
Grant Agreement cannot be amended before the new supplementary agreement has been
provided to the granting authority.
Former host institution remains beneficiary — If certain team members (or equipment)
stay with the former host institution, while the PI moves to a new host institution, the Grant
Agreement is transferred and changed into a multi-beneficiary grant (allowing both the
former host institution and the new host institution to participate in the grant). The former
host institution stays on as beneficiary, the organisation that hosts and engages the PI is the
new host institution.
If the former host institution remains only for a limited time (e.g. to ensure a smooth
handover), it can then be terminated at a later stage (see Article 32).
Recruitment costs — The host institution must guarantee the PI scientific independence to
select the other team members. Thus, for ERC actions, recruitment costs, if clearly
attributable to the action, are eligible as ‘other direct costs’, even for the unsuccessful
candidates (because recruitment is part of the action activities).
Purchase of scientific publications — The host institution must provide research support
to the PI regarding any equipment, products or services necessary for conducting the
research. Consequently, costs related to the purchase of scientific publications (e.g. books,
manuscripts, articles, digital copies, etc) may be eligible, if their direct link to the action and
their necessity for the action is demonstrated.
Costs for ‘teaching buy-outs’ — The host institution must support the PI and provide
administrative assistance. However, if the host institution hires substitutes to perform some
of the PI’s duties that are not linked to the ERC grant (e.g. teaching), these costs are NOT
eligible.

ERC Work Programme and the call and topics pages of the ERC calls.

on the European Charter for Researchers
and on a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment
of Researchers
The Commission ofthe European Communities
Having regard to the Treatyestablishing the European Community, and in
particular Article 165 thereof
Whereas
(1) The Commission considered itnecessaryin January2000 1to estab-
lish the European Research Area asthe linchpin ofthe Community’s
future action in thisfield with a view to consolidating and giving struc-
ture to a European research policy.
(2) The Lisbon European Council set the Community the objective of
becoming the mostcompetitive and dynamicknowledge economyin
the world by2010.
(3) The Councilhasaddressed issuesrelated to the profession and the
career ofresearcherswithin the European Research Area in itsResolution
of10 November 2003 2and welcomed in particular the Commission’s
intention to worktowardsthe developmentofa European Researcher’s
Charter and a Code ofConductfor the RecruitmentofResearchers.

the profession and the career ofresearcherswithin the European Research Area).
3(4) The identified potentialshortage ofresearchers3, particularlyin cer-
tain key disciplines, will pose a serious threat to EU’s innovative
strength, knowledge capacity and productivity growth in the near
future and mayhamper the attainmentofthe Lisbon and Barcelona
objectives. Consequently, Europe must dramatically improve its
attractiveness to researchers and strengthen the participation of
women researchersbyhelping to create the necessaryconditionsfor
more sustainable and appealing careersfor them in R&D 4.
(5) Sufficientand well-developed human resourcesin R&D are the cor-
nerstone of advancement in scientific knowledge, technological
progress, enhancing the qualityoflife, ensuring the welfare ofEuro-
pean citizensand contributing to Europe’scompetitiveness.
(6) New instrumentsfor the career developmentofresearchersshould be
introduced and implemented, thuscontributing to the improvement
ofcareer prospectsfor researchersin Europe.
(7) Enhanced and more visible career prospectsalso contribute to the
building of a positive public attitude towards the researchers’ pro-
fession, and thereby encourage more young people to embarkon
careersin research.
(8) The ultimate politicalgoalofthisRecommendation isto contribute to
the development of an attractive, open and sustainable European
labour marketfor researchers, where the frameworkconditionsallow
for recruiting and retaining high qualityresearchersin environments
conducive to effective performance and productivity.
(9) Member States should endeavour to offer researchers sustainable
career developmentsystemsatallcareer stages, regardlessoftheir
contractualsituation and ofthe chosen R&D career path, and they

4should endeavour to ensure thatresearchersare treated asprofes-
sionalsand asan integralpartofthe institutionsin which theywork.
(10) Even though Member Stateshave made considerable effortsto over-
come administrative and legalobstaclesto geographicaland inter-
sectoralmobility, manyofthese obstaclesstillremain.
(11) Allformsofmobilityshould be encouraged aspartofa comprehen-
sive human resource policyin R&D atnational, regionaland institu-
tionallevel.
(12) The value ofallformsofmobilityneedsto be fullyrecognised in the
career appraisal and career advancement systems for researchers,
thusguaranteeing thatsuch an experience isconducive to their pro-
fessionaldevelopment.
(13) The development of a consistent career and mobility policy for
researchersto 5and from the European Union should be considered
with regard to the situation in developing countriesand regionswithin
and outside Europe, so thatbuilding research capacitieswithin the
European Union does not occur at the expense of less developed
countriesor regions.
(14) Fundersor employersofresearchersin their role asrecruitersshould
be responsible for providing researcherswith open, transparentand
internationallycomparable selection and recruitmentprocedures.
(15) Societyshould appreciate more fullythe responsibilitiesand the pro-
fessionalism thatresearchersdemonstrate in executing their workat
different stages of their careers and in their multi-faceted role as
knowledge workers, leaders, projectcoordinators, managers, super-
visors, mentors, career advisorsor science communicators.

respective national, regionalor sectorallegislation requirements.
(17) ThisRecommendation providesMember States, employers, funders
and researcherswith a valuable instrumentto undertake, on a vo-
luntarybasis, further initiativesfor the improvementand consolidation
ofresearchers’ career prospectsin the European Union and for the
creation ofan open labour marketfor researchers.
(18) The generalprinciplesand requirementsoutlined in thisRecommen-
dation are the fruits of a public consultation process to which the
members of the Steering Group on Human Resources and Mobility
have been fullyassociated,
Herebyrecommends:
1. ThatMember Statesendeavour to undertake the necessarystepsto
ensure thatemployersor fundersofresearchersdevelop and main-
tain a supportive research environmentand working culture, where
individuals and research groups are valued, encouraged and sup-
ported, and provided with the necessarymaterialand intangible sup-
port to enable them to fulfil their objectives and tasks. Within this
context, particular priority should be given to the organisation of
working and training conditionsin the earlystage ofthe researchers’
careers, asitcontributesto the future choicesand attractivenessof
a career in R&D.
2. ThatMember Statesendeavour to take, wherever necessary, the cru-
cialstepsto ensure thatemployersor fundersofresearchersimprove
the recruitmentmethodsand career evaluation/appraisalsystemsin
order to create a more transparent, open, equaland internationally
accepted system of recruitment and career development as a pre-
requisite for a genuine European labour marketfor researchers.
63. That Member States - as they formulate and adopt their strategies
and systemsfor developing sustainable careersfor researchers- take
duly into account and are guided by the general principles and
requirements, referred to asThe European Charter for Researchers
and the Code ofConductfor the RecruitmentofResearchersoutlined
in the Annex.
4. ThatMember Statesendeavour to transpose these generalprinciples
and requirementswithin their area ofresponsibilityinto nationalre-
gulatoryframeworksor sectoraland/or institutionalstandardsand
guidelines(chartersand/or codesfor researchers). In so doing they
should take into accountthe greatdiversityofthe laws, regulations
and practiceswhich, in differentcountriesand in differentsectors,
determine the path, organisation and working conditionsofa career
in R&D.
5. That Member States consider such general principles and require-
ments as an integral part of institutional quality assurance mecha-
nismsbyregarding them asa meansfor establishing funding criteria
for national/regionalfunding schemes, aswellasadopting them for
the auditing, monitoring and evaluation processesofpublicbodies.
6. ThatMember Statescontinue their effortsto overcome the persisting
legaland administrative obstaclesto mobility, including those related
to intersectoral mobility and mobility between and within different
functions, taking into accountan enlarged European Union.
7. ThatMember Statesendeavour to ensure thatresearchersenjoyade-
quate socialsecuritycoverage according to their legalstatus. Within
thiscontext, particular attention should be paid to the portabilityof
pension rights, either statutory or supplementary, for researchers
moving within the publicand private sectorsin the same countryand
also for those moving across borders within the European Union.
Such regimesshould guarantee thatresearcherswho, in the course
7oftheir lives, change jobsor interrupttheir careersdo notundulysuf-
fer a lossofsocialsecurityrights.
8. ThatMember Statesputin place the necessarymonitoring structures
to review thisRecommendation regularly, aswellasto measure the
extentto which employers, fundersand researchershave applied the
European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the
RecruitmentofResearchers.
9. That the criteria for measuring this will be established and agreed
with the Member Stateswithin the contextofthe workundertaken by
the Steering Group on Human Resourcesand Mobility.
10. That Member States in their role as representatives in the interna-
tionalorganisationsestablished atintergovernmentalleveltake due
accountofthisRecommendation when proposing strategiesand tak-
ing decisionsconcerning the activitiesofthose organisations.
11. This Recommendation is addressed to the Member States but it is
also intended asan instrumentto encourage socialdialogue, aswell
asdialogue among researchers, stakeholdersand societyatlarge.
12. The Member Statesare invited to inform the Commission, asfar as
possible, by 15th December 2005 and annually thereafter of any
measures they have taken further to this Recommendation, and to
inform it of the first results of its application as well as to provide
examplesofgood practice.
13. ThisRecommendation willbe reviewed periodicallybythe Commis-
sion in the contextofthe Open Method ofCoordination.

8ANNEX
Section 1
The European CharterforResearchers
The European Charter for Researchersisa setofgeneralprinciplesand
requirementswhich specifiesthe roles, responsibilitiesand entitlements
of researchers as well as of employers and/or funders of researchers6.
The aim of the Charter is to ensure that the nature of the relationship
between researchersand employersor fundersisconducive to successful
performance in generating, transferring, sharing and disseminating
knowledge and technological development, and to the career develop-
mentofresearchers. The Charter also recognizesthe value ofallformsof
mobility as a means for enhancing the professional development of
researchers.
In thissense, the Charter constitutesa frameworkfor researchers, employers
and funderswhich invitesthem to actresponsiblyand asprofessionals
within their working environment, and to recognise each other assuch.
The Charter addressesallresearchersin the European Union atallstages
oftheir career and coversallfieldsofresearch in the publicand private
sectors, irrespective ofthe nature ofthe appointmentor employment7, the
legalstatusoftheir employer or the type oforganisation or establishment
in which the workiscarried out. Ittakesinto accountthe multiple rolesof
researchers, who are appointed not only to conduct research and/or to
carryoutdevelopmentactivitiesbutare also involved in supervision, men-
toring, managementor administrative tasks.
6 See definition in Section 3.
7 See definition in Section 3.
9This Charter takes as its premise that researchers as well as employers
and/or fundersofresearchershave an overriding obligation to ensure that
theymeetthe requirementsofthe respective nationalor regionallegisla-
tion. Where researchers enjoy a status and rights which are, in certain
respects, more favourable than those provided for in thisCharter, itsterms
should notbe invoked to diminish the statusand rightsalreadyacquired.
Researchers, aswellasemployersand funders, who adhere to thisChar-
ter willalso be respecting the fundamentalrightsand observe the prin-
ciplesrecognised bythe Charter ofFundamentalRightsofthe European
Union 8.

10General Principles and Requirements
applicable to Researchers:
Research Freedom
Researchersshould focustheir research for the good ofmankind and for
expanding the frontiersofscientificknowledge, while enjoying the free-
dom ofthoughtand expression, and the freedom to identifymethodsby
which problemsare solved, according to recognised ethicalprinciplesand
practices.
Researchers should, however, recognise the limitations to this freedom
thatcould arise asa resultofparticular research circumstances(including
supervision/guidance/management) or operational constraints, e.g. for
budgetaryor infrastructuralreasonsor, especiallyin the industrialsector,
for reasons of intellectual property protection. Such limitations should
not, however, contravene recognised ethicalprinciplesand practices, to
which researchershave to adhere.
Ethicalprinciples
Researchersshould adhere to the recognised ethicalpracticesand fun-
damentalethicalprinciplesappropriate to their discipline(s) aswellasto
ethicalstandardsasdocumented in the differentnational, sectoralor insti-
tutionalCodesofEthics.
Professionalresponsibility
Researchersshould make everyeffortto ensure thattheir research isre-
levantto societyand doesnotduplicate research previouslycarried out
elsewhere.
11Theymustavoid plagiarism ofanykind and abide bythe principle ofintel-
lectualpropertyand jointdata ownership in the case ofresearch carried
out in collaboration with a supervisor(s) and/or other researchers. The
need to validate new observationsbyshowing thatexperimentsare repro-
ducible should notbe interpreted asplagiarism, provided thatthe data to
be confirmed are explicitlyquoted.
Researchersshould ensure, ifanyaspectoftheir workisdelegated, that
the person to whom itisdelegated hasthe competence to carryitout.
Professionalattitude
Researchers should be familiar with the strategic goals governing their
research environmentand funding mechanisms, and should seekallne-
cessaryapprovalsbefore starting their research or accessing the resources
provided.
They should inform their employers, funders or supervisor when their
research projectisdelayed, redefined or completed, or give notice ifitis
to be terminated earlier or suspended for whatever reason.
Contractualand legalobligations
Researchers at all levels must be familiar with the national, sectoral or
institutional regulations governing training and/or working conditions.
This includes Intellectual Property Rights regulations, and the require-
ments and conditions of any sponsor or funders, independently of the
nature oftheir contract. Researchersshould adhere to such regulationsby
delivering the required results(e.g. thesis, publications, patents, reports,
new productsdevelopment, etc) assetoutin the termsand conditionsof
the contractor equivalentdocument.
12Accountability
Researchers need to be aware that they are accountable towards their
employers, fundersor other related publicor private bodiesaswellas, on
more ethical grounds, towards society as a whole. In particular,
researchersfunded bypublicfundsare also accountable for the efficient
use oftaxpayers’ money. Consequently, theyshould adhere to the prin-
ciplesofsound, transparentand efficientfinancialmanagementand co-
operate with anyauthorised auditsoftheir research, whether undertaken
bytheir employers/fundersor byethicscommittees.
Methodsofcollection and analysis, the outputsand, where applicable,
detailsofthe data should be open to internaland externalscrutiny, when-
ever necessaryand asrequested bythe appropriate authorities.
Good practice in research
Researchersshould atalltimesadoptsafe working practices, in line with
nationallegislation, including taking the necessaryprecautionsfor health
and safetyand for recoveryfrom information technologydisasters, e.g. by
preparing proper back-up strategies. Theyshould also be familiar with the
currentnationallegalrequirementsregarding data protection and confi-
dentialityprotection requirements, and undertake the necessarystepsto
fulfilthem atalltimes.
Dissemination, exploitation ofresults
All researchers should ensure, in compliance with their contractual
arrangements, that the results of their research are disseminated and
exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research settingsor,
if appropriate, commercialised. Senior researchers, in particular, are
expected to take a lead in ensuring thatresearch isfruitfuland thatresults
13are either exploited commercially or made accessible to the public (or
both) whenever the opportunityarises.
Publicengagement
Researchersshould ensure thattheir research activitiesare made known
to societyatlarge in such a waythattheycan be understood bynon-spe-
cialists, therebyimproving the public’sunderstanding ofscience. Direct
engagement with the public will help researchers to better understand
publicinterestin prioritiesfor science and technologyand also the pub-
lic’sconcerns.
Relation with supervisors
Researchersin their training phase should establish a structured and re-
gular relationship with their supervisor(s) and faculty/departmentalrep-
resentative(s) so asto take fulladvantage oftheir relationship with them.
Thisincludeskeeping recordsofallworkprogressand research findings,
obtaining feedbackbymeansofreportsand seminars, applying such feed-
backand working in accordance with agreed schedules, milestones, deliv-
erablesand/or research outputs.
Supervision and managerialduties
Senior researchersshould devote particular attention to their multi-faceted
role assupervisors, mentors, career advisors, leaders, projectcoordina-
tors, managers or science communicators. They should perform these
tasksto the highestprofessionalstandards. With regard to their role as
supervisorsor mentorsofresearchers, senior researchersshould build up
a constructive and positive relationship with the early-stage researchers,
in order to setthe conditionsfor efficienttransfer ofknowledge and for the
further successfuldevelopmentofthe researchers’ careers.
14Continuing ProfessionalDevelopment
Researchersatallcareer stagesshould seekto continuallyimprove them-
selvesbyregularlyupdating and expanding their skillsand competencies.
Thismaybe achieved bya varietyofmeansincluding, butnotrestricted to,
formaltraining, workshops, conferencesand e-learning.
15General Principles and Requirements applicable to Employers and
Funders:
Recognition ofthe profession
Allresearchersengaged in a research career should be recognised aspro-
fessionals and be treated accordingly. This should commence at the
beginning of their careers, namely at postgraduate level, and should
include alllevels, regardlessoftheir classification atnationallevel(e.g.
employee, postgraduate student, doctoralcandidate, postdoctoralfellow,
civilservants).
Non-discrimination
Employers and/or funders of researchers will not discriminate against
researchers in any way on the basis of gender, age, ethnic, national or
social origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation, language, disability,
politicalopinion, socialor economiccondition.
Research environment
Employers and/or funders of researchers should ensure that the most
stimulating research or research training environment is created which
offersappropriate equipment, facilitiesand opportunities, including for
remote collaboration over research networks, and thatthe nationalor sec-
toralregulationsconcerning health and safetyin research are observed.
Fundersshould ensure thatadequate resourcesare provided in supportof
the agreed workprogramme.
16Working conditions
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thatthe working conditionsfor
researchers, including for disabled researchers, provide where appropri-
ate the flexibilitydeemed essentialfor successfulresearch performance in
accordance with existing nationallegislation and with nationalor sectoral
collective-bargaining agreements. They should aim to provide working
conditionswhich allow both women and men researchersto combine fam-
ilyand work, children and career 9. Particular attention should be paid,
interalia, to flexible working hours, part-time working, tele-working and
sabbaticalleave, aswellasto the necessaryfinancialand administrative
provisionsgoverning such arrangements.
Stabilityand permanence ofemployment
Employers and/or funders should ensure that the performance of
researchersisnotundermined byinstabilityofemploymentcontracts, and
should therefore committhemselvesasfar aspossible to improving the
stability of employment conditions for researchers, thus implementing
and abiding bythe principlesand termslaid down in the EU Directive on
Fixed-Term Work10.
9 See SEC(2005) 260, Women and Science: Excellence and Innovation – Gender Equalityin
Science.
10 Which aimsto preventfixed-term employeesfrom being treated lessfavourablythan similar
permanentemployees, to preventabuse arising from the use ofsuccessive fixed-term con-
tracts, to improve accessto training for fixed-term employeesand to ensure thatfixed-term
employeesare informed aboutavailable permanentjobs. CouncilDirective 1999/70/ECcon-
cerning the “FrameworkAgreementon fixed-term work” concluded byETUC, UNICEand CEEP,
adopted on 28 June 1999.
17Funding and salaries
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould ensure thatresearchers
enjoyfair and attractive conditionsoffunding and/or salarieswith ade-
quate and equitable social security provisions (including sickness and
parentalbenefits, pension rightsand unemploymentbenefits) in accor-
dance with existing nationallegislation and with nationalor sectoralcol-
lective bargaining agreements. Thismustinclude researchersatallcareer
stagesincluding early-stage researchers, commensurate with their legal
status, performance and levelofqualificationsand/or responsibilities.
Gender balance 11
Employersand/or fundersshould aim for a representative gender balance
atalllevelsofstaff, including atsupervisoryand manageriallevel. This
should be achieved on the basisofan equalopportunitypolicyatrecruit-
mentand atthe subsequentcareer stageswithout, however, taking prece-
dence over qualityand competence criteria. To ensure equaltreatment,
selection and evaluation committees should have an adequate gender
balance.
Career development
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould draw up, preferablywithin
the frameworkoftheir human resourcesmanagement, a specificcareer
developmentstrategyfor researchersatallstagesoftheir career, regard-
lessoftheir contractualsituation, including for researcherson fixed-term
contracts. Itshould include the availabilityofmentorsinvolved in provi-
ding supportand guidance for the personaland professionaldevelopment
of researchers, thus motivating them and contributing to reducing any
11 See SEC(2005) 260, Women and Science: Excellence and Innovation – Gender Equalityin
Science.
18insecurity in their professional future. All researchers should be made
familiar with such provisionsand arrangements.
Value ofmobility
Employersand/or fundersmustrecognise the value ofgeographical, inter-
sectoral, inter- and trans-disciplinaryand virtual12mobilityaswellasmobi-
lity between the public and private sector as an important means of
enhancing scientificknowledge and professionaldevelopmentatanystage
ofa researcher’scareer. Consequently, theyshould build such optionsinto
the specificcareer developmentstrategyand fullyvalue and acknowledge
anymobilityexperience within their career progression/appraisalsystem.
Thisalso requiresthatthe necessaryadministrative instrumentsbe putin
place to allow the portabilityofboth grantsand socialsecurityprovisions,
in accordance with nationallegislation.
Accessto research training and continuousdevelopment
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thatallresearchersatanystage
of their career, regardless of their contractual situation, are given the
opportunityfor professionaldevelopmentand for improving their employ-
abilitythrough accessto measuresfor the continuing developmentofskills
and competencies.
Such measuresshould be regularlyassessed for their accessibility, take-
up and effectivenessin improving competencies, skillsand employability.
12 i.e. remote collaboration over electronicnetworks.
19Accessto career advice
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thatcareer advice and job place-
mentassistance, either in the institutionsconcerned, or through collabo-
ration with other structures, isoffered to researchersatallstagesoftheir
careers, regardlessoftheir contractualsituation.
IntellectualPropertyRights
Employers and/or funders should ensure that researchers at all career
stagesreap the benefitsofthe exploitation (ifany) oftheir R&D results
through legal protection and, in particular, through appropriate protec-
tion ofIntellectualPropertyRights, including copyrights.
Policies and practices should specify what rights belong to researchers
and/or, where applicable, to their employersor other parties, including
externalcommercialor industrialorganisations, aspossiblyprovided for
under specificcollaboration agreementsor other typesofagreement.
Co-authorship
Co-authorship should be viewed positivelybyinstitutionswhen evaluating
staff, asevidence ofa constructive approach to the conductofresearch.
Employersand/or fundersshould therefore develop strategies, practices
and proceduresto provide researchers, including those atthe beginning
oftheir research careers, with the necessaryframeworkconditionsso that
theycan enjoythe rightto be recognised and listed and/or quoted, in the
contextoftheir actualcontributions, asco-authorsofpapers, patents, etc,
or to publish their own research resultsindependentlyfrom their supervi-
sor(s).
20Supervision
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thata person isclearlyidentified
to whom early-stage researcherscan refer for the performance oftheir pro-
fessionalduties, and should inform the researchersaccordingly.
Such arrangementsshould clearlydefine thatthe proposed supervisors
are sufficientlyexpertin supervising research, have the time, knowledge,
experience, expertise and commitment to be able to offer the research
trainee appropriate supportand provide for the necessaryprogressand
review procedures, aswellasthe necessaryfeedbackmechanisms.
Teaching
Teaching isan essentialmeansfor the structuring and dissemination of
knowledge and should therefore be considered a valuable option within
the researchers’ career paths. However, teaching responsibilitiesshould
notbe excessive and should notpreventresearchers, particularlyatthe
beginning oftheir careers, from carrying outtheir research activities.
Employers and/or funders should ensure that teaching duties are ade-
quatelyremunerated and taken into accountin the evaluation/appraisal
systems, and thattime devoted bysenior membersofstaffto the training
ofearlystage researchersshould be counted aspartoftheir teaching com-
mitment. Suitable training should be provided for teaching and coaching
activitiesaspartofthe professionaldevelopmentofresearchers.
Evaluation/appraisalsystems
Employersand/or fundersshould introduce for allresearchers, including
senior researchers, evaluation/appraisalsystemsfor assessing their pro-
fessionalperformance on a regular basisand in a transparentmanner by
an independent(and, in the case ofsenior researchers, preferablyinter-
national) committee.
21Such evaluation and appraisal procedures should take due account of
their overall research creativity and research results, e.g. publications,
patents, managementofresearch, teaching/lecturing, supervision, men-
toring, nationalor internationalcollaboration, administrative duties, pub-
lic awareness activities and mobility, and should be taken into
consideration in the contextofcareer progression.
Complaints/appeals
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould establish, in compliance
with nationalrulesand regulations, appropriate procedures, possiblyin
the form of an impartial (ombudsman-type) person to deal with com-
plaints/appeals of researchers, including those concerning conflicts
between supervisor(s) and early-stage researchers. Such procedures
should provide allresearch staffwith confidentialand informalassistance
in resolving work-related conflicts, disputesand grievances, with the aim
of promoting fair and equitable treatment within the institution and
improving the overallqualityofthe working environment.
Participation in decision-making bodies
Employers and/or funders of researchers should recognise it as wholly
legitimate, and indeed desirable, thatresearchersbe represented in the
relevantinformation, consultation and decision-making bodiesofthe insti-
tutionsfor which theywork, so asto protectand promote their individual
and collective interestsasprofessionalsand to activelycontribute to the
workingsofthe institution 13.
13 In thiscontextsee also EU Directive 2002/14/EC.
22Recruitment
Employers and/or funders should ensure that the entry and admission
standardsfor researchers, particularlyatthe beginning attheir careers, are
clearly specified and should also facilitate access for disadvantaged
groupsor for researchersreturning to a research career, including teachers
(ofanylevel) returning to a research career.
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould adhere to the principles
setoutin the Code ofConductfor the RecruitmentofResearcherswhen
appointing or recruiting researchers.
23Section 2
The Code ofConductforthe RecruitmentofResearchers
The code ofconductfor the recruitmentofresearchersconsistsofa setof
generalprinciplesand requirementsthatshould be followed byemployers
and/or funders when appointing or recruiting researchers. These prin-
ciples and requirements should ensure observance of values such as
transparencyofthe recruitmentprocessand equaltreatmentofallappli-
cants, in particular with regard to the developmentofan attractive, open
and sustainable European labour market for researchers, and are com-
plementary to those outlined in the European Charter for Researchers.
Institutionsand employersadhering to the Code ofConductwillopenly
demonstrate their commitment to act in a responsible and respectable
wayand to provide fair frameworkconditionsto researchers, with a clear
intention to contribute to the advancementofthe European Research Area.
General Principles and Requirements for the Code of Conduct
Recruitment
Employersand/or fundersshould establish recruitmentprocedureswhich
are open 14, efficient, transparent, supportive and internationallycompa-
rable, aswellastailored to the type ofpositionsadvertised.
14 Allavailable instrumentsshould be used, in particular internationalor globallyaccessible
web-based resources such as the pan-European Researcher’s Mobility Portal:
http://europa.eu.int/eracareers.
24Advertisementsshould give a broad description ofknowledge and com-
petencies required, and should not be so specialised as to discourage
suitable applicants. Employersshould include a description ofthe working
conditions and entitlements, including career development prospects.
Moreover, the time allowed between the advertisementofthe vacancyor
the callfor applicationsand the deadline for replyshould be realistic.
Selection
Selection committeesshould bring together diverse expertise and compe-
tencesand should have an adequate gender balance and, where appropri-
ate and feasible, include membersfrom differentsectors(publicand private)
and disciplines, including from other countriesand with relevantexperience
to assessthe candidate. Whenever possible, a wide range ofselection prac-
ticesshould be used, such asexternalexpertassessmentand face-to-face
interviews. Membersofselection panelsshould be adequatelytrained.
Transparency
Candidatesshould be informed, prior to the selection, aboutthe recruitment
processand the selection criteria, the number ofavailable positionsand the
career developmentprospects. Theyshould also be informed after the selec-
tion processaboutthe strengthsand weaknessesoftheir applications.
Judging merit
The selection processshould take into consideration the whole range of
experience 15ofthe candidates. While focusing on their overallpotentialas
researchers, their creativity and level of independence should also be
considered.
15 See also The European Charter for Researchers: Evaluation/Appraisalsystemsin Section 1 of
thisdocument.
25Thismeansthatmeritshould be judged qualitativelyaswellasquantita-
tively, focusing on outstanding resultswithin a diversified career path and
notonlyon the number ofpublications. Consequently, the importance of
bibliometricindicesshould be properlybalanced within a wider range of
evaluation criteria, such asteaching, supervision, teamwork, knowledge
transfer, managementofresearch and innovation and publicawareness
activities. For candidatesfrom an industrialbackground, particular attention
should be paid to anycontributionsto patents, developmentor inventions.
Variationsin the chronologicalorder ofCVs
Career breaksor variationsin the chronologicalorder ofCVsshould notbe
penalised, butregarded asan evolution ofa career, and consequently, as
a potentiallyvaluable contribution to the professional development of
researcherstowardsa multidimensionalcareer track. Candidatesshould
therefore be allowed to submit evidence-based CVs, reflecting a repre-
sentative arrayofachievementsand qualificationsappropriate to the post
for which application isbeing made.
Recognition ofmobilityexperience
Anymobilityexperience, e.g. a stayin another country/region or in another
research setting (publicor private) or a change from one discipline or sector
to another, whether aspartofthe initialresearch training or ata later stage
ofthe research career, or virtualmobilityexperience, should be considered
asa valuable contribution to the professionaldevelopmentofa researcher.
Recognition ofqualifications
Employersand/or fundersshould provide for appropriate assessmentand
evaluation ofthe academicand professionalqualifications, including non-
formalqualifications, ofallresearchers, in particular within the contextof
26internationaland professionalmobility. Theyshould inform themselves
and gain a fullunderstanding ofrules, proceduresand standardsgover-
ning the recognition of such qualifications and, consequently, explore
existing nationallaw, conventionsand specificruleson the recognition of
these qualificationsthrough allavailable channels16.
Seniority
The levelsofqualificationsrequired should be in line with the needsofthe
position and notbe setasa barrier to entry. Recognition and evaluation
ofqualificationsshould focuson judging the achievementsofthe person
rather than his/her circumstancesor the reputation ofthe institution where
the qualifications were gained. As professional qualifications may be
gained atan earlystage ofa long career, the pattern oflifelong profes-
sionaldevelopmentshould also be recognised.
Postdoctoralappointments
Clear rulesand explicitguidelinesfor the recruitmentand appointmentof
postdoctoralresearchers, including the maximum duration and the objec-
tives of such appointments, should be established by the institutions
appointing postdoctoral researchers. Such guidelines should take into
accounttime spentin prior postdoctoralappointmentsatother institutions
and take into consideration that the postdoctoral status should be
transitional, with the primarypurpose ofproviding additionalprofessional
development opportunities for a research career in the context of long-
term career prospects.

Definitions
Researchers
For the purpose ofthisRecommendation the internationallyrecognised
Frascati definition ofresearch 17willbe used. Consequently, researchersare
described as
“Professionalsengaged in the conception orcreation of newknowledge,
products, processes, methodsand systems, and in the managementof
the projectsconcerned.”
More specifically, thisRecommendation relatesto allpersonsprofessio-
nallyengaged in R&D atanycareer stage 18, regardlessoftheir classification.
This includes any activities related to “basic research”, “strategic
research”, “applied research”, experimentaldevelopmentand “transfer of
knowledge” including innovation and advisory, supervisoryand teaching
capacities, the managementofknowledge and intellectualpropertyrights,
the exploitation ofresearch resultsor scientificjournalism.
A distinction is made between Early-Stage Researcher and Experienced
Researchers:
• The term Early-Stage Researcher 19refersto researchersin the first
four years(full-time equivalent) oftheir research activity, including
the period ofresearch training.

19 See WorkProgramme Structuring the European Research Area Human Resourcesand Mobil-
ityMarie Curie Actions, edition September 2004, page 41.
28• Experienced Researchers 20 are defined as researchers having at
leastfour yearsofresearch experience (full-time equivalent) since
gaining a universitydiploma giving them accessto doctoralstudies,
in the country in which the degree/diploma was obtained or
researchersalreadyin possession ofa doctoraldegree, regardless
ofthe time taken to acquire it.
Employers
In the context of this Recommendation “employers” refers to all those
publicor private institutionswhich employresearcherson a contractual
basisor which hostthem under other typesofcontractsor arrangements,
including those without a direct financial relationship. The latter refers
particularlyto institutionsofhigher education, facultydepartments, lab-
oratories, foundationsor private bodieswhere researcherseither undergo
their research training or carryouttheir research activitieson the basisof
funding provided bya third party.

KI-NA-21620-EN-C The European Commission has adopted the European Charter for
Researchers and a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of
Researchers. These two documents are key elements in the EU’s
policy to make research an attractive career, which is a vital
feature of its strategy to stimulate economic and employment
growth. The Charter and Code of Conduct will give individual
researchers the same rights and obligations wherever they may
work throughout the EU. This should help counter the fact that
research careers in Europe are fragmented at local, regional,
national or sectoral level, and allow Europe to make the most of
its scientific potential.Horizon Europe

Version 2.0
28 February 2025EU Grants: Evaluation form (HE MSCA): V2.0 – 28.02.2025
IMPORTANT NOTICE
Scoring:
Scoring must be in the range from 0-5. Half-marks may be given.
0 — The proposal fails to address the criterion or cannot be assessed due to missing or
incomplete information.
1 — Poor. The criterion is inadequately addressed, or there are serious inherent
weaknesses.
2 — Fair. The proposal broadly addresses the criterion, but there are significant
weaknesses.
3 — Good. The proposal addresses the criterion well, but a number of shortcomings are
present.
4 — Very Good. The proposal addresses the criterion very well, but a small number of
shortcomings are present.
5 — Excellent. The proposal successfully addresses all relevant aspects of the criterion.
Any shortcomings are minor.
Thresholds & weighting:
The threshold for the individual criteria is 3. The overall threshold, applying to the sum of the 3
individual scores, is 10 points.
Weighting is only for the ranking (not to determine if the proposal passed the thresholds).
Specific calls or topics may have different rules regarding threshols and weighting.
Specific cases:
Two-stage calls
For stage 1 proposals, only the criteria Excellence and Impact will be evaluated and within those
criteria only the aspects indicated in bold in General Annex of the Main Work Programme. The
threshold for each of the two individual criteria is 4.
After the evaluation, the call coordinator will then fix an overall threshold, to limit the proposals that
will be invited to stage 2. (This overall threshold will be set at a level which ensures that the total
requested budget of proposals admitted to stage 2 is as close as possible to three times the available
budget, and in any case, not less than 2.5 the available budget. The actual level will therefore depend
on the volume of proposals received. The threshold is expected to normally be around 8 or 8.5.)

1. My Area — User account and roles
Getting access to My Area
The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is the central electronic portal for all EU funding and
tenders.
It is managed by the European Commission and used by itself and other EU services (together
‘EU’) for their grants, prizes and procurements.
The Portal has two parts: A public section with general information (Funding Opportunities,
Reference Documents, etc) and My Area, which is a secured, personalised section (Portal
electronic exchange system) used by the participants for managing their proposals and
grants/contracts.
For security reasons, access to My Area is based on:
• EU Login account — unique identifier for individuals. All you need to open an EU Login
account is your work e-mail address.
• Roles & access rights (Identity and Access Management System — IAM)
• PIC number — unique identifier for organisations. This 9-digit number is received after
you register in the Portal Participant Register.
In My Area you can:
• get access to non-public information on your proposals, projects/contracts,
organisations, etc
• register in the Participant Register and update your organisation/natural person data
• sign contracts, submit reports, cost claims, invoices and receive payments
• communicate with the EU services about your ongoing projects/contracts
• for experts working with the EU services: register, sign contracts, manage tasks, submit
cost claims and receive payments
• for external audit firms working with the EU services: register and manage tasks
Individual users:
• have to register as a user only once
• will be asked to agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions on their first login
• will have specific access rights, depending on their roles in the
organisation/projects/contracts
Organisations:
• will be asked to agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions when they appoint their LEAR.
1.1 EU Login
EU Login provides a single sign-on to a large number of services and tools available on the

• To create an EU Login account, you click on the Register button on the Portal homepage;
all you need is your name and work e-mail address.
• If you already have an EU Login account, you must use that one.
EU Login is the new name for the previously used ECAS account (European Commission
Authentication System); old accounts continue to work, there is no need to create new ones.
Creating an EU Login account
Go to the Portal Register page and enter:
• your first name, last name and e-mail address
• the displayed security code.
Select Create an account
You will receive an e-mail to the address that you specified, containing a link you should
use to complete the registration process.
Click the link you will be asked to choose and confirm a password.
Go back to the Portal homepage.
Click on Login and log in with your registered e-mail (user name) address and
password.
Your EU Login password and user name is personal — do NOT share it with colleagues or
anyone else. All transactions made with your account (user name, password) will be considered
as having been made by yourself. Keep your password secure and change it regularly.
Logging in to the Portal with your EU Login account
After logging in, you can use the personalised services and tools available on the Portal.
Your EU Login account gives you only general access to My Area, but it will NOT yet give you
access to project/contract data of your organisation. This access depends on your roles and
access rights.
FAQ
• FAQ on EU Login help page
1.2 Roles and access rights
Roles and access rights restrict the information a user can view and the tasks they can perform
(for instance, only a person with the coordinator role can delete a draft application).
Access rights are linked to a user's roles in the Portal personalised area (My Area), which are
in turn linked to their functions within their organisation or in relation to a particular
project/contract and their nomination by the organisation’s LEAR (or other authorised person).
6EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
How are access rights managed?
Roles are divided into 2 main sections:
• Organisation roles are linked to the whole organisation and its data (but without any
access to the projects/contracts)
• Project/contract roles are defined first in the proposal, and then transferred to the
project/contract when you have been invited to sign with the EU. They are managed
application by application and project by project, covering all types of access
(read/write/submit).
One user can have several roles at the same time.
How are the roles assigned?
Most of these roles can be freely assigned and managed by you or your organisation, according
to your needs:
• you can start creating an application yourself
• you can be invited by other users who have created an application to join their
application
• persons in your organisation can give you (and revoke) access to roles of your
organisation
• the initiator of an application (or persons in your organisation involved in an on-going
application) can give you (and revoke) access to roles in the application
• persons involved in on-going projects/contracts can give you (and revoke) access to
roles in their projects/contracts.
All access rights are linked to the user's EU Login account.
Exceptions
The EU services intervene in the assignment of the following 2 key roles:
LEAR (Legal Entity Appointed Representative) — organisation role
The LEAR is the person that is officially nominated by an organisation to manage rights and
obligations related to the use of the Portal and to act as main administrative and legal contact
in case of issues. Usually, LEARs are staff members in the central administration of the
organisation. The LEAR handles all the organisation-related data on the Portal and appoints the
persons within their organisation that are allowed to electronically sign grants/contracts and
cost claims.
There can only be one LEAR per organisation.
LEARs are validated by the Central Validation Service as part of the registration in the
Participant Register. Learn more about the detailed procedure for appointing the LEAR.
Primary Coordinator Contact — project role
The Main Contact/Contact Point of the Coordinator/Group Leader in the application will become
the PCoCo (Primary Coordinator Contact). This person is by default the one creating the
application in the Portal and thereby becomes the main person responsible for the application.
As such, they can submit requests, reports and notifications to the EU on behalf of the
consortium.
7EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
There can only be one PCoCo per project/contract.
During the application phase and before call deadline, the PCoCo may transfer this role to
someone else in the application.
Afterwards (i.e. after call submission is closed), a new PCoCo can be assigned only by the EU
Project/Procurement Officer. If such a replacement becomes necessary, the Coordinator should
send a request to the Officer via the Portal Messaging Service (My Projects/My Contracts >
Actions > Manage Project/Contract).
Exceptionally — and only until a LEAR has been appointed — self-registrants have certain
roles (that were not assigned to any of the other users listed above).
Roles — Overview
The picture below shows all the roles involved in managing organisations and projects/contracts
in the Portal.
For some funding programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe ERC and MSCA grants), additional roles
are used. See the for more details.
Organisation roles
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
The LEAR is the formally nominated main responsible for an organisation’s use of the Portal and
thus bears the final responsibilty for all the organisation’s actions in the Portal.
LEARs have system rights to:
• update their organisation's data
• nominate/revoke representatives of their organisation to electronically sign
grant/contracts
• nominate/revoke representatives of their organisation to electronically sign cost
claims/invoices
• nominate/revoke Account Administrators within their organisation to help them with
their work.
8EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The LEAR does NOT assign the Legal Signatories and Financial Signatories for a particular
project/contract. This is done by the Coordinator Contact (CoCo) or Participant Contact (PaCo)
of that project/contract.
Self-registrant
The Self-registrant is the person who first registers an organisation in the Portal Participant
Register.
Before the LEAR is validated, Self-registrants can provide the EU with requested information
and documents about their organisation.
Once the LEAR has been formally validated (normally after the organisation has been validated
by the Central Validation Service), the role of Self-registrant is revoked and replaced by the
LEAR.
Account Administrator
The LEAR may delegate tasks to one or more Account Administrators. Though the LEAR keeps
the full responsibility, Account Administrators can fulfil tasks for their LEAR. An organisation
can have an unlimited number of Account Administrators.
If the organisation nominates a new person as their LEAR, the existing Account Administrators
remain, but can be revoked by the new LEAR.
Legal Signatory (LSIGN)
LSIGNs must be nominated for an organisation by the LEAR or an Account Administrator (see
Figure 3).
LSIGNs are assigned to a particular project by a Coordinator or Participant Contact (see Figure
3). An organisation can have an unlimited number of LSIGNs.
Financial Signatory (FSIGN)
FSIGNs must be nominated for an organisation by the LEAR or an Account Administrator (see
Figure 3).
FSIGNs are assigned to a particular project by a Coordinator or Participant Contact (see Figure
3). An organisation can have an unlimited number of FSIGNs.
Primary Audit Contact (PAuCo) and Audit Contact (AuCo)
Audit roles can be assigned in the Portal only when the organisation is audited.
The LEAR is automatically assigned the Primary Audit Contact (PAuCo), and can nominate other
PAuCos in the organisation.
The PAuCo(s) must also nominate at least one Audit Contact (AuCo) as main contact for audits
on the organisation, and additionally, assign both the AuCo and the audit to an audit team
within the organisation.
PAuCos have the following system rights for their organisation:
• nominate other PAuCo(s) for the organisation and the AuCo(s) for an audit (My
Organisations > Actions > View Roles, click the Roles tab). Detailed explanations are
available in the
• manage the teams in the organisation to assign the audits and the audit contacts to
them (My Organisations > Actions > View Roles, click the Teams tab). Detailed
explanations are available in the
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• revoke other roles
AuCos can nominate other AuCos for the teams to which they are assigned. They can also
revoke other AuCos in their team.
An AuCo assigned to a team has the following system rights for those audits:
• perform the audit tasks for their organisation
• communicate with the EU auditors (receive and send formal notifications, submit audit
documents, etc)
Summary organisation roles
When nominating FSIGNs or LSIGNs, the LEAR can add comments that can help the
Participant Contacts to select the right LSIGN/FSIGN for their project (e.g. "Mr Smith can sign
for projects run by Department X from 1 February 2014."). Such comments can be useful for
defining the scope of responsibilities or duration of FSIGNs or LSIGNs in large organisations
with different departments.
Proposal roles
When preparing your proposal, you will need to define the participating organisations and the
organisation/proposal contact(s). Both are set in the application online form.
For grants and prizes: The proposal will contain the following types of participating
organisations:
• Coordinator. A proposal can have only one, and you may submit an application with just
one Coordinator and no other participating organisations. You need to name a
10EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Coordinator immediately to launch your application, but you can change it later on,
before submission.
• Partner. A proposal can have none, one or more. The number of Partners in an
application (and other aspects such as the country where they are registered, etc) are
subject to the call conditions (i.e. the specific requirements for each call for proposals).
• Partners can also have Affiliated Entities linked to them (through a permanent legal or
capital link or as members of an association; former Linked Third Parties). Affiliated
Entities are allowed to fully participate in the grant and claim costs. They must comply
with all eligibility conditions (same as a Partner).
• Associated Partners. This kind of participating organisation contributes to the project
but cannot claim costs. They are normally not linked to any Partner and do not need to
comply with the eligibility conditions.
Then, you will need to define the contact persons for each participating organisation. There are
two possible types of contacts:
• Main Contact. You need to define one per participating organisation.
• Contact Person. You may define one or more Contact Persons for each Partner. You may
further define their kind of access as Coordinator/Participant Contact (full access) or
Team Member (read-only access).
The roles in your proposal will afterwards become project roles:
• The Main Contact of the Coordinator will become the Primary Coordinator Contact
(PCoCo). This role is automatically assigned to the initiator of the application who
submits the proposal to the EU.
• The Main Contacts of the Partners will become Participant Contacts (PaCo).
• The Contact Persons of the Coordinator/Partners will become Team Members (TeMe) if
they had read-only access in the application form or Participating Contacts (PaCo) if
they had full access.
For tenders:
The tender will contain the following types of participating organisations:
• Group Leader. A submission can have only one, and you may submit a tender with just
one Group Leader and no more participating organisations.
• Group Member. A submission can have none, one or more (often none).
In a call for tenders, you need to provide one single contact: Contact Point. One per application.
This Contact is always linked to the Group Leader.
During the submission phase, this is the only role which will be defined. The Contact Point will
then become the Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo).
Project/contract roles
Depending on your project roles you can have read-only, read-write or read-write-submit rights
to information, documents and online forms.
(Primary) Coordinator Contact (PCoCo/CoCo)
The Primary Coordinator Contact is for each project the main contact between the consortium
and the EU for a particular project/contract. By default, it is the person that creates the
application in the Portal.
11EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The PCoCo can nominate/revoke a Coordinator Contact (CoCo) for the project/contract
(unlimited number possible), who will then have the same rights — except the right to revoke
the PCoCo.
All Coordinator Contacts can:
• nominate/revoke Participant Contacts for other organisations in the consortium
• nominate/revoke Task Managers and Team Members in their own organisation
• assign Legal and Financial Signatories in their organisation to their projects
• make changes to project documents on the Portal
• communicate with the EU services and submit applications and project documents to
the EU.
It is important to list your partner organisations (and their contact persons) relatively early
on in the application process, because this will give them access to the application and allow
them to appoint other roles for their organisation.
Participant Contact (PaCo)
The PaCo is a representative of an organisation in the consortium that is not the coordinating
organisation.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of PaCos per project, and each will be able to:
• nominate/revoke other PaCos in their organisation
• assign Legal and Financial Signatories in their organisation to their projects/contracts
• submit their work to the Coordinator
• nominate/revoke Task Managers and Team Members in their own organisation
• make changes specifically to the participant-related sections of the project documents
on the Portal
• submit information directly to the EU services (if required under the Grant Agreement)
Task Manager (TaMa)
TaMas can perform some restricted actions: creating, updating and uploading documents about
their organisation's participation and completing, modifying or deleting project/contract
information.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of TaMas per project. They cannot nominate or
revoke anybody, nor submit information to the Coordinator or EU.
This role is not used during the application phase.
Team Member (TeMe)
TeMes have limited access rights: search and read-only functions.
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN)
The PLSIGN has the right to sign the grant/contract (and amendments) for a specific project on
behalf of the organisation.
12EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint LSIGNs; the Coordinator and each
participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PLSIGNs for a given project to act as legal
signatory for the participant in the project.
An organisation can have can have an unlimited number PLSIGNs per project.
They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot
assign/revoke any roles.
Project Financial Signatory (PFSIGN)
The PFSIGN has the right to sign cost claims/invoices on behalf of the organisation.
The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint FSIGNs; the Coordinator and each
participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PFSIGNs for a given project to act as legal
signatory for the participant in the project.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of PFSIGNs per project.
They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot
assign/revoke any roles.
Summary project/contract roles
Rights associated with roles
13EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Nomination process
Some roles are automatically given based on the information in your application:
• The proposal initiator will become the Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo).
• The main contact persons in the participating organisations will become Participant
Contacts (PaCos).
• Persons with read-only access to the proposal will become Team Members (TeMes).
Once your organisation is validated by the Central Validation Service, it is important that
you appoint a LEAR to make sure that you can manage the access rights to the Portal.
How to nominate/revoke someone
To grant a role, the LEAR (or other authorised person) must enter the user's e-mail address. It
must be the same as the address the person used to open their EU Login account.
If the person does not already have an EU Login account, they will automatically receive an
invitation to create one.
Organisation roles — to grant/revoke, go to My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation
Roles > Add Roles.
Project/contract roles — to grant/revoke, go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Consortium
> Edit Roles.
How many different roles are needed in a consortium?
A user's EU Login account can carry any combination of roles, this depends on the participants.
Thus, a user can acquire a differentiated set of access rights to different functions for managing
projects, contracts or organisation data.
For small organisations or beneficiaries who are individuals (natural persons), this means
that one single person can combine all the access rights needed to manage their
projects/contracts (i.e. LEAR, CoCo/PaCo, PLSIGN and PFSIGN).
The minimum configuration for a consortium in any given project is:
• 1 Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo)
14EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• 1 Participant Contact (PaCo) per beneficiary
• 1 LEAR per organisation
• 1 Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN) per organisation
• 1 Project Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) per organisation.
One person can have several roles at the same time.
Organisations that participate as Affiliated Entities (or other type of participant — Associated
Partner, Subcontractor, etc) do NOT need any access roles in the Portal, since they are not
allowed to use it. All actions in the Portal are handled for them by the Coordinator/Beneficiary
they are linked to.

1.3 Accepting the Terms and Conditions of Use
The Portal is part of the Single Electronic Data Exchange Area set up under Articles 147 and
128 of the EU Financial Regulation.
On the first login to My Area, users must agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions and the
Portal Privacy Statement.
Organisations will be asked to agree to the Terms and Conditions when they appoint their LEAR
(declaration of consent). Every time you access to My Area, you are implicitly reaffirming
your acceptance of the Terms and Conditions valid at that time.
Personal data will be kept and processed for the purposes of the Single Electronic Data Exchange
Area, i.e. for the management and implementation of your EU grants, contracts, prizes and
other transactions managed through the Portal. The detailed conditions for the processing of
your personal data are set out in the Portal Privacy Statement.
2. Participant Register — Register your organisation
15EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If you want to submit a proposal, your organisation needs to be registered in the Portal
Participant Register and have a 9-digit Participant Identification Code (PIC).
If your proposal is successful, you will receive a notification and be asked to:
• provide supporting documents to confirm the administrative and legal information
declared during the registration (legal entity validation)
• appoint a Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR appointment)
• provide supporting documents to verify the financial capacity of your organisation
(financial capacity assessment, if applicable)
• validate the bank account for payments (bank account validation, only for coordinators).
2.1 Registration and validation of your organisation
Before submitting an application, all participants involved in the proposal must first be
registered in the Portal Participant Register and have their 9-digit Participant Identification Code
(PIC number).
You can verify directly on the Portal whether your organisation is already registered and has a
PIC. If not, please proceed with the registration following the instructions on the same page
(the Registration wizard will help you through the process). Once completed, you get the PIC
to be used in your online application form and further correspondence with the EU services.
If you do not have an user account (EU Login), you will first need to create one, before starting
the registration process. If you already have a user account (EU Login), you can log in and
directly start registration.
Please note that the Participant Register is primarily directed at organisations and that not
all of the labels fit for individuals (natural persons). Enter your information as appropriate (e.g.
country of residence instead of country of registration, passport number instead of registration
number, etc).
What you need to register your organisation
To register your organisation, you will need to provide basic administrative and legal
information, in addition to contact details.
Get ready
Since the declared information will be verified against supporting documents later on, it is
useful to have the relevant documents at hand when you complete the registration, to
make sure you fill in everything correctly (legal form, non-profit, public/private, etc).
16EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Check for already existing PIC
In order to avoid creating duplicate PICs, you should first check whether your organisation
(or another department) is already registered in the Portal and use that PIC.
Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Search a PIC > Search a PIC and put in
your organisation data. Check several variants to make sure there is really no entry.
If no PIC is registered, start registration
Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Register your organisation. The
Registration wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process.
Detailed explanations are available in the .
You do not need to complete the registration process in a single session. You can enter some
information, save it and continue later on. To resume your registration, go to My Organisations
> Continue Registration. Incomplete draft registrations are automatically deleted after one
year.
If you create by mistake a new PIC, see below Data updates.
PIC number
After completing a new registration, you will receive the 9-digit Participant Identification
Code (PIC) — to be used in your online application form and further correspondence with the
EU services.
The newly created PIC will be provisional (declared/non-valid status) until it is formally validated
at a later stage.
Nothing else is expected from you after the PIC has been generated, the Central Validation
Service will contact you later, to initiate the validation process.
Validation of your organisation
If your proposal is successful, you will be contacted for the validation of your PIC
registration data.
Validation is needed only for certain types of participants (grants: Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities; procurement: Contractors). It is not needed for Associated Partners, Subcontractors
or other participants.
It will be done by the Central Validation Service which carries out the validation for all EU
services using the Portal.
The Central Validation Service will contact the person who registered the organisation (Self-
registrant) and ask them to:
• upload official supporting documents (via the My Organisations page)
• clarify any details.
The documents that are required will be listed in the notification you receive. You will need to
fill out a legal entity identification form and provide us with an official VAT document,
registration extract, statutes or act of establishment, etc. The detailed list of documents is also
17EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
explained in the Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity
Assessment.
The Central Validation Service will check that your organisation is legally recognised (has legal
personality). If this is not the case (exceptionally this is allowed), you will have to prove that
the representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on the organisation’s behalf
and that the organisation has financial and operational capacity equivalent to that of legal
persons.
The Central Validation Service will also check whether your organisation qualifies for some of
the special legal statuses that are required for some funding programmes (private or public
body, non-profit, international organisation).
The outcome of this process is the validation of your organisation (validated PIC). The Central
Validation Service will send a confirmation message once the process is completed and the PIC
is validated.
Please don’t forget that all communications with the Central Validation Service must take
place through the Participant Register (My Organisations page). Emails and other
communications will NOT be accepted.
Please also note that if you apply for a call with specific eligibility criteria that are not validated
by the Central Validation Service, these will be checked by the responsible EU service managing
the call — in addition to the validation, which means that they may come back to you with
additional questions.
Validation of the organisation is a prerequisite for the LEAR appointment.
Data updates
Updates to the registered organisation data must be requested via the Participant Register (My
Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation):
• by the LEAR (or Account Administrators) for validated entities
• by the Self-registrant if your organisation has not been validated yet.
If your organisation has already a validated PIC and a new one is created by mistake, your
LEAR or Account Administrator should contact the Central Validation Service via the Portal
Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation). The information will be
transferred from the duplicate PIC to the correct PIC and the duplicate flagged.
SME self-assessment
In addition to the standard validation, a SME self-assessment is needed if you apply for a call
where SME status is an eligibility criterion (or allows for a higher funding rate or other
advantages).
If there is no recent (not older than 2 years) SME self-assessment information available in the
Participant Register, the Portal Submission System will automatically prompt you to go through
the SME self-assessment wizard to establish your SME status. You will need to enter the
financial figures of the last approved accounting period of your organisation and of any other
organisation that might be directly or indirectly related to you. If the result confirms your SME
status, you will be able to proceed with the application process.
Please note that the SME self-assessment is only needed if the SME-status is an eligibility
criterion (or gives special advantages); otherwise, you will simply self-declare your SME status
in the Legal Information tab and proceed with the registration.Detailed rules are explained in
the Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment.

2.2 LEAR appointment and validation
Parallel to the validation of your organisation, you will be requested by the Central Validation
Service to appoint your Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR).
This must be done by a legal representative of your organisation with the necessary legal
authority to commit the organisation for this type of decisions (e.g. typically CEOs, rectors,
Director-Generals, etc... always in accordance with the statutes of your organisation). If
such decisions are normally reserved for joint decision-making by several representatives, the
appointment must be done together (documents signed by all).
The LEAR role, which can be performed by any member of the organisation (typically from the
central administration), is key. They are formally nominated to manage your organisation’s use
of the Portal and thus bear the final responsibilty for all your actions in the Portal. Once
validated, they will be responsible for:
• keeping an overview of all the proposals/projects/contracts your organisation is involved
in
• managing all the legal and financial information about your organisation
• managing the access rights at organisation-level (and read-only access at project-level)
• appointing the persons which will be able to electronically sign grants/contracts (Legal
Signatories — LSIGNs) and cost claims/invoices (Financial Signatories — FSIGNs).
Applicants that are natural persons do not need to prove their capacity to become a LEAR, but
still need to enter their LEAR data and submit supporting documents.
Further details about the LEAR's rights and responsibilities are explained in the Roles and access
rights section.
Appointing and validation of your LEAR
Please note that registration and validation of your organisation is a prerequisite for the
validation of your LEAR.
Identify the person in your organisation who will act as LEAR and the legal
representative who will appoint them
The person who initially registered the organisation in the Participant Register (the Self-
registrant) will receive the notification from the Central Validation Service to launch the
LEAR appointment procedure.
Encode in the Participant Register the name and contact information of the
LEAR and the legal representative appointing them
19EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
To do so, the Self-registrant must go to My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation.
The Participant Register will, then, generate the necessary documents to be signed:
• LEAR appointment letter and LEAR role and duties (generated as a single document)
• declaration of consent to the Portal Terms & Conditions.
The system will automatically check the existence of an EU Login account for the LEAR (e-
mail address, first and last name). In case of inconsistencies, the system alerts the Self-
registrant. If no EU Login account exists, the system will start creating one and the LEAR
will be requested (via a notification e-mail) to finalise it. The LEAR appointment process
will be blocked until this is done.
Get your organisation's legal representative to:
• date, sign and stamp the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR roles and duties
document generated by the system ( both sections must be signed)
• read the Portal Terms and Conditions and
• date, sign and stamp the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions.
Upload the following documents in the Participant Register:
• the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR role and duties (dated and signed by the legal
representative and the LEAR)
• the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions (dated and signed by
the legal representative)
• copies of an official valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport) with a photo and
signature of:
the legal representative and
o
the appointed LEAR
o
• documents proving the authority of the legal representative; these documents
must:
clearly indicate the person’s role/function within the organisation as legal
o
representative
identify and appoint the individual (by name) as the person covering that
o
specific role/function.
Don't forget that you MUST keep the originals of all documents you uploaded, so that
they are available in case of EU controls, checks or audits. Since your registration in the
Participant Register is valid for this and any future EU funding and tenders procedures your
organisation will ever apply for, the originals must be kept permanently, as long as you are
registered in the Portal (and possibly beyond, for controls, checks and audits, etc). You
should therefore NOT throw them away and ensure that they are maintained also in case
of insolvency, takeover or change of control.
Validation of the LEAR appointment by the Central Validation Service
20EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
After receiving the above-listed documents and once the corresponding PIC has been
validated, the Central Validation Service will also validate the LEAR appointment in the
Participant Register.
Activate the LEAR's online user account
After validation, the LEAR account (with the special access rights) can be be activated by:
• following the instructions the LEAR receives by e-mail
• using the account activation PIN code which will be sent to the LEAR by post, or
by SMS if the LEAR's mobile phone number was provided
Should you encounter any problems with the LEAR appointment, please contact the Central
Validation Service via the Portal Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions> Modify
Organisation).
Data updates — Changing the LEAR
If you need to replace an already validated LEAR, you can designate a new LEAR by making a
new appointment (same steps as initial appointment).
If you are a LEAR and your e-mail address has changed, please inform the Central Validation
Service via the Portal Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation),
in order to obtain instructions on how to proceed for the change.
How can you contact the LEAR?
For contacting LEARs of other organisations, go to How to participate > Participant Register >
Search a PIC to find the organisation. Then, select Actions > Contact Organisation. This will
launch a contact form that allows you to send a message to the LEAR (and their Account
Administrators). The LEAR can then contact you directly.
To contact your own LEAR, log in and then go to My Organisations > Actions > Contact
Organisation.

2.3 Bank account registration and validation
Registration and validation of the bank account for payments
In addition to the validation of the participating organisations, we also have to validate the bank
account that will be used for our payments to you (usually bank account of the Coordinator).
The Central Validation Service will contact the Coordinator after the PIC is validated, to enter
the bank account details into the Participant Register and upload the necessary supporting
documents (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you will need
to provide the bank account details and either a bank statement or financial identification form.
21EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The Central Validation Service will cross-check this information and validate the account.When
registering your organisation for the first time, you do not need to declare any bank account
information. You will be prompted to do this only later on, if your proposal is successful.
Data updates
If you need to change an already validated bank account, please declare the new bank account
details via the Participant Register and upload the required supporting documents.
Please note that it can happen that not all types of modifications are supported. In case of an
issue, please contact the IT Helpdesk.
2.4 Financial capacity assessment
Assessment of your financial capacity
For some participants, we will also have to check the financial capacity before awarding
grants/contracts.
For grants, the criteria for checking financial capacity are set out in the call conditions.
Normally, the financial capacity assessment will be done for all Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities, except:
− public bodies (entities established as public body under national law, including local,
regional or national authorities) or international organisations
− if the individual requested grant amount is EUR 60 000 or below.
Specific rules apply for some programmes (i.e. only for coordinators; only for grants above a
certain threshold; State guarantee; see Horizon Europe Programme Guide, Erasmus+
Programme Guide).
The Central Validation Service will contact you during grant preparation to upload the necessary
financial documents (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you will need
to provide documents showing your financial situation for the last two closed financial years
(profit and loss account and balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an approved
external auditor, certifying the accounts for the last closed financial year, etc).
The analysis is based on neutral financial indicators (liquidity, financial autonomy, solvency and
profitability), but will also take into account other aspects, such as dependency on EU funding
and deficit and revenue in previous years. The results of your financial capacity assessment will
be taken into account when evaluating your ability to implement the project (and to take on
the Coordinator role, if it is the case).
If we consider that your financial capacity is not satisfactory, we may require:
– an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several liabiliy for all
Beneficiaries or joint and several liability of Affiliated Entities
– prefinancing paid in instalments (multiple/additional prefinancing)
– (one or more) prefinancing guarantees
or
– propose no prefinancing or
– request that you are replaced or, if needed, reject the entire application.
22EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Specific rules apply to programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM, former Participant
Guarantee Fund; e.g. Horizon Europe). For these programmes, prefinancing guarantees and
joint and several liability of Beneficiaries are normally excluded.
Financial capacity self-check
You can check your financial capacity yourself by using the Financial capacity self-check
simulator.
The self-check is not available for all programmes (because of the algorithms used).
Moreover, it is only a simulation. If a formal financial capacity assessment is required, you will
have to go through the formal procedure.

2.5 Data updates
Who can update the online information about your organisation?
• Initially, only the person who first registered the organisation or any other appointed
Self-registrant
• once appointed, only the appointed representative (LEAR) and appointed Account
Administrators.
To change the information on your organisation, go to My Organisations > Actions > Modify
Organisation.
Please upload legal/financial supporting documents for any updates you submit so that the
Central Validation Service can validate them. Maximum size for uploads: 6MB per file
Changes of legal status
If your organisation changes status or address, your LEAR should immediately update the
information in the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation) and,
if possible, directly inform (via your Coordinator) your EU Project Officers in ongoing grants
(Coordinator uses the Portal Messaging Facility: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Process communications > New message).
Some changes like, for instance, partial or universal transfers of rights will moreover require
amendments in case you have ongoing Grant Agreements/Procurement Contracts.
Managing roles in the organisation
If organisation roles need to be changed, your LEAR should immediately update them in the
system (My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation Roles)
If project/contract roles need to be changed, your CoCo/PaCo should immediately update them
in the system (My Projects > Actions > Project Consortium).
If grants/contracts or cost claims/invoices are signed in the system by persons whose access
rights should have been revoked, this will be your responsibility and you will have to bear the
consequences. Their signatures and other actions will be considered valid by the EU services.

2.6 Complaints about validation
If you believe that a validation result is flawed, you can submit a complaint (following the
deadline and procedure set out in the message on the validation result).
Generally, the means of redress are the following:
• request for validation review — within 30 days of receiving the message
• request for review of legality under Article 22 of Regulation 58/2003 — within 1 month
of receiving the message (using the Article 22 complaints form template)
• action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU — within 2 months of receiving the
message.
You are free to choose any of the above means of redress. However, in the interest of good
administration and procedural efficiency, it is recommended to use first the available
administrative review procedures (if any). The objective of these procedures is to re-examine
the circumstances of the validation procedure and to reach a final decision on your registration.
Deadlines for further redress will therefore run as from when you receive our reply with the
final position.
Please note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending are
considered to have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from opening/access (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
When filing a complaint, please take into account that the formal decision was taken by the
Central Validation Service hosted in the REA executive agency, and that complaints must
therefore be directed against that agency (NOT against the European Commission).
In case you consider that there has been maladministration on the part of the Central Validation
Service, you can also address a complaint to the European Ombudsman — within 2 years after
you became aware of it AND after having used all the means of administrative redress available
(validation review and Article 22 request).

You can access calls and topics in your area of interest through the Portal Search funding &
tenders page. This page allows you to search in the text of the call and topic titles, call and
topic identifiers, topic description and keywords and tags. You can also filter using the quick
search per topics related to specific EU priorities.
If you would like to receive updates on new calls, you can subscribe to the Funding Opportunities
RSS feed.
The Search funding & tenders page also hosts calls for tenders (EU procurements) and prizes.
It does NOT cover financial instruments (EU loans and venture capital) — these are normally
managed through financial partners (banks), but the Portal homepage has a direct link to the
Access to finance page on Europa.
Calls and topics
On the Portal most calls are divided into topics.
Call — Group of topics that are open in parallel and address the same policy domain.
Topic — Part of a call with one opening and closing date. The proposals submitted to the topic
will be evaluated together and compete against each other.
The Search funding & tenders page will display the list of open topics; the name of the call they
belong to is visible on the Topic page.
The Topic page contains all the information you need to have for your proposal (call conditions,
legal framework and key documents, standard application form and other practical information
you need to prepare your proposal). The Topic page also specifies the call deadline and contains
a link to the Portal Submission System, through which you can submit your proposal. The
Topic page also contains call and topic updates (changes or important information for the
applicants).
Deadline for submission
A topic is considered open until the deadline for submission has passed (call deadline).
Each topic will specify deadlines and/or cut-off dates.
Deadline models
Single-stage
For most topics, you must submit a full proposal by the call deadline.
Two-stage
26EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Some topics have a 2-stage submission procedure, which means that you have to submit a
short outline proposal for stage 1 and then a full proposal only if you are invited to stage 2
(meaning that your project looks promising).
Multiple cut-off
Some topics are continuously open, where you can submit a proposal at any time, and cut-
off dates mean that all proposals received by a given cut-off date will be evaluated after that
deadline.
Types of action
Types of action designate funding schemes, i.e. calls with the same characteristics: policy
domain (scope of funded activities), award criteria, reimbursement rate and in some cases form
of funding (budget-based grant, lump sum grant, unit grant, prize, procurement, debt and
equity facility, etc).
The types of action depend on each EU programme.
There are two main types: action grants (for projects) and operating grants (to support
organisations and their running costs).
In addition, most programmes distinguish the following:
• Project Grants
• Lump Sum Grants
• Unit Grants and
• Framework Partnerships.
However, especially larger programmes have developed their own specific set of types of action,
for instance:
• Horizon Europe: Research and Innovation Actions, Innovation Actions, Coordination and
Support Actions, Pre-commercial Procurements, Public Procurement of Innovative
Solutions, etc
• Digital Europe: Simple Grants, Coordination and Support Actions, SME Support Actions,
Grants for Financial Support, Grants for Procurement, PAC Grants for Procurement,
Lump Sum Grants, Framework Partnerships
• CEF: Project Grants, Infrastructure Projects, Lump Sum Grants, Unit Grants, Framework
Partnerships
• Single Market Programme: Project Grants, Lump Sum Grants, Grants for Financial
Support, PPI Grants for Procurement, Framework Partnerships, European Statistics, etc.
Within the types of actions, EU grants fund all kinds of activities (collaborative actions,
coordination and networking actions, coordination and support actions, support to
organisations, technical assistance and capacity building actions, mobility actions, cofund
actions to existing grant schemes/procurements of the beneficiaries, infrastructure actions,
etc).
Technology readiness levels (TRL)
Calls in the field of innovation (close to market) often use the notion of technology readiness
level to specify also the level of technology readiness that is expected from the projects. There
are 9 technology readiness levels:
27EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• TRL 1 — basic principles observed
• TRL 2 — technology concept formulated
• TRL 3 — experimental proof of concept
• TRL 4 — technology validated in lab
• TRL 5 — technology validated in relevant environment
• TRL 6 — technology demonstrated in relevant environment
• TRL 7 — system prototype demonstration in operational environment
• TRL 8 — system complete and qualified
• TRL 9 — actual system proven in operational environment.
3.1.2 Projects that can be funded — Conditions for funding
The types of projects and activities that can be funded are set out for each call in the call
conditions on the Topic page.
The other conditions (eligibility of participants, admissibility requirements, exclusion grounds,
operational and financial capacity requirements, award criteria, etc) are also explained on the
Topic page.
Please note that for some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe, EDF and AMIF), projects may
need to undergo additional checks and procedures before funding can be awarded, such as
specific ethics review, security scrutiny, third country control check, etc.
3.1.3 Apply with partners or as individual
Who can apply?
To see whether your organisation is eligible for funding, check the call conditions on the Topic
page.
In general, most EU funding programmes require that participants (Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities) are:
• legal entities (public or private bodies, including international organisations)
and
• established in one of the eligible countries, i.e.:
EU Member State (including EU overseas countries and territories (OCTs))
o
eligible non-EU countries:
o
EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway — if opted-in for the
o
programme)
associated countries (countries associated to the funding programme by
o
paying a contribution — list differs for each programme).
Please be aware, however, that almost all programmes have additional criteria, which
widen or narrow the group of entities that can apply. Some programmes are open to participants
from the entire world (e.g. Horizon Europe) others are deliberately restricted to EU countries
only (e.g. EDF). In addition, the situation can be different from call to call even within a
programme. It is therefore very important to carefully look at the call conditions.
Moreover, participants must be registered in the Participant Register (mandatory for
Beneficiaries, Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners) and be validated by the Central
28EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Validation Service by the time the grant is signed (mandatory for Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities).
Multi-participant or mono-participant actions
Most of the calls for EU grants target multi-beneficiary consortia made up of participants from
different countries — to enhance the EU added value, promote cooperation between
organisations in different countries, reinforce the quality of applications and ensure fair
competition and equal opportunities throughout the EU.
Some programmes formalise this, by adding specific requirements for the consortium
composition (e.g. Horizon Europe, UCPM, etc).
To see whether a call requires minimum consortium composition, check the call conditions on
the Topic page.
How to find partners for your project ideas?
To find partners for your project ideas, you can:
• Use the Partner Search function of the Portal. The function allows to:
look for organisations which received funding in the past
o
create and check Partner Search requests by call/topic
o
• Use other Partner Search tools and services. A list of recommended support sites is
offered under the Helpdesks & Support Services page.
• Participate in conferences, brokerage events organised by the EU or networks in the
Member States (National Contact Points or Desks, Enterprise Europe Network, etc).
Portal Partner Search
If you want to find experienced partners who already have ongoing projects, or if you want to
browse in the database of registered organisations, visit the Partner Search page. You can
search by keyword/geographical area/funding type, etc. Search results include complete
organisation profiles with lists of funded projects and the possibility to contact representatives.
If you have selected your area of interest via the Topic search, you may publish your
offer/interest for one or more of the open/forthcoming topics of a call on the Portal. All your
published offers/interests will be visible on your organisation's page too.
Enterprise Europe Network Cooperation Opportunities Database — The Enterprise Europe
Network (EEN) publishes an extensive number of innovation and technology profiles from
international companies and research organisations to help identify suitable partners for
bilateral business, innovation and technology cooperation. The EEN database is updated with
new profiles on a weekly basis. All profiles are published anonymously. Express your interest in
collaboration by filling in and sending the Expression of Interest form to your local EEN office,
who will establish the contact.
Consortium roles and responsibilities
When setting up your grant consortium, you should think of organisations that help you reach
objectives and solve problems.
29EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Beneficiaries — Affiliated Entities — Associated Partners —
Subcontractors
The roles should be attributed according to the level of participation in the project. Main
participants should participate as Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities (former Linked Third
Parties); other entities can participate as Associated Partners, Subcontractors, Third parties
giving in-kind contributions, etc.
Associated Partners and Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not get any part
of the grant money and will therefore have to organise other funding sources (bear their own
costs, internal reallocation of funding inside the consortium, find investors, etc).
Subcontracting should normally constitute a limited part of the project and will need to
be justified (give reasons). Tasks may NOT be subcontracted inside the consortium (between
Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities).
Coordinator — Other Beneficiaries
The Coordinator is responsible for managing the project, submitting reports and deliverables
and acting as intermediary for all contacts with the EU Granting Authority.
The other Beneficiaries must implement their part of the project and contribute to the grant
administration (preparing the grant, reporting, etc).
The consortium participants will be jointly responsible for implementing the project activities
(in accordance with their proposal/description of the action). If a project is not finished (or badly
implemented), the grant money may have to be reduced for everyone.
3.1.4 Submit a proposal — Portal Submission System
Proposal submission
Proposals must be submitted electronically using the Portal Submission System.
Where? Access to the Submission System is available through the Topic page on the Portal>
Start Submission.
Who? Proposals must be created and submitted by a contact person of the coordinating
organisation. Exceptions exist for some programmes/types of action which are fully focused on
individuals (e.g. the Principal Investigator in Horizon Europe ERC grants or the Fellow in Horizon
Europe MSCA grants).
How? The Submission wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process. You will need
to use the online forms and templates available in the Submission System. The application form
is described below.
Submission process
Get prepared: Finding your topic > Find partners > Plan your work and budget
Electronic proposal submission: Get an EU Login account > Get a PIC number (Participant
Register) > Launch Submission wizard > Pre-register your draft proposal > List participants,
contact persons > Fill in Administrative Forms (Part A) > Upload Technical Description (Part B)
> Submit your proposal > Acknowledgement of receipt
Application form (Part A and B)
30EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Proposals are submitted using the application forms available in the Submission System. The
application form is structured in into two parts, Parts A and B:
• Part A: contains the structured Administrative Forms with data on the participants, legal
declarations and contact persons (retrieved from the Submission System screens). It
may also include some programme-specific questions.
• Part B (the narrative part): Technical Description of the project with the planned
activities, work packages, costs, etc (must be uploaded as PDF).
Part A is generated while entering the data into the Submission System; Part B needs to be
prepared in advance (using the template downloaded from the system; do NOT use the standard
template from the Topic page).
Part B will also include annexes and supporting documents if required by the call conditions
(detailed budget table, declarations from national authorities, CVs, annual activity reports, etc).
All participants can contribute to the parts, but it is the person from the coordinating
organisation who created the application who must finalise and submit the application.
For programmes with specific security requirements, special instructions may apply (e.g. for
EDF, documents must be uploaded through a password-word protected zip file). For such
programmes, detailed instructions will be available in the call documentation.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Mandate: Make sure that you have the mandate of all participants to submit the
application (explicit agreement to participate).
• Quality check:
Check that the application is coherent and that Part A and B are consistent (especially
budgetary information).
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed; make
sure that no annexes are missing.
Confidentiality
EU services will treat your proposal confidentially, as well as any related information, data
and documents received.
Our evaluators (both in-house and outside experts, if any) are also bound by an obligation of
confidentiality.
Please do NOT discuss your proposal with persons that might act as expert evaluator for us
or be otherwise involved in the evaluation, since this could lead to a conflict of interest with
adverse consequences both for you and the concerned person.
Security, data protection and document retention
Your proposal and all the information received from you will be stored under secure conditions
at all times. The Portal is a closed, secured platform with multiple safeguards.
After the evaluation, we will keep the proposals for audit trail purposes (at least 5 years for
unsuccessful proposals and 10 years after project end for successful proposals and, possibly,
longer if needed for controls, checks and audit purposes).
Personal data will be handled according to the standards set out in Regulation No 2018/1725
and in line with the Portal Privacy Statement.
31EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please be aware that your proposal MUST NOT contain any classified information (Decision
2015/444 or national rules).
Access to proposals
The proposals will remain sealed and closed until after the call deadline.
However, in order to plan the evaluation process (organise translations, evaluation capacities,
evaluators with specialist knowledge, etc) we will ask you for permission to access to certain
information already before:
• call title and topic for which the proposal is submitted
• title of your application, proposal abstract, keywords
• PICs of the participating organisations
• relevant panel (for proposals submitted to specific panels, e.g. Horizon Europe MSCA,
UCPM).
A warning will inform you that the Granting Authority will be accessing this information and
will give you the opportunity to refuse access.

3.1.4.1 Get prepared
Before you can start completing your application, you should study the call documentation,
select partners and plan your project.
Study the call documentation
Choose your topic, and then read carefully the related documents and standard
templates that are available on the Topic page.
The Submission System will check some basic admissibility and eligibility requirements,
but NOT all of them. It is therefore very important that you carefully read the call
conditions. Please note that whenever there is a contradiction between the IT checks in
place and the call documentation, the call documentation prevails.
Select your partners for the project
Most calls require several participants in the proposal (see call conditions on the Topic
page).
You can use the Portal Partner Search to find partners. Other partner search tools are
explained in the Helpdesk & Support Services page.
Plan your project and prepare the Technical Description (Part B)
Planning of the work (work packages, deliverables, milestones)
32EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Look at the call conditions, award criteria and standard application form (Technical
Description (Part B)) on the Topic page.
For most types of action the Technical Description must give a detailed description of the
project idea and work plan (work packages, milestones and deliverables, division of
responsibilities and resources, time schedule, project management structure,
dissemination and communication activities).
Work packages
All project activities should be grouped in a logical, consistent and structured way into
separate work packages. All work packages must present a clear, logical link to the
project objectives and to the other work packages. Ideally, each work package should
constitute a sub-part of the project, a step leading to the achievement of the project’s
overall goals.
Projects should normally have at least 2 work packages:
− work package 1 — management and coordination activities
− work package 2 — outputs related to the project goals.
Beyond that, create only as many as you need (as many as necessary, as few as
possible).
Work package 1 should normally cover all activities related to the general management
and coordination of the project and any activities that do not relate to any of the work
packages leading to a specific result, but which are directly linked to the project as a whole.
For the other work packages, describe the:
• objective(s)
• activities to be implemented — in specific terms
• (tangible and intangible) outputs to be produced.
Milestones & deliverables (if required)
Concerning the outputs:
1. Distinguish between milestones and deliverables:
− milestones: control points in the project that help to chart progress (kick-
off meetings, steering committes, first-draft of a survey, prototype, etc)
− deliverables: outputs to be submitted to the EU (publication, leaflet,
progress report, brochure, list, etc)
2. Be as specific as possible, e.g.:
− events — the number of events, title, content, duration, number of
participants, etc.
− publications — number of pages, language, format (printed/electronic),
number of printed copies (in each language), etc.
3. Be realistic about what you can achieve within the project duration. The scope of
your project should be large enough to make a difference, but it doesn't need to produce
an excessively high number of outputs.
4. Refer only to major outputs. Do NOT include minor sub-items, internal working
papers, meeting minutes, etc. Adapt the number of deliverables to the size of your
33EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
project and work packages (use as many as necessary, as few as possible). You may
be asked to reduce or increase the number during grant preparation.
Budget
Look at the budget table in the Administrative Forms (Part A) in the Submission System.
Only the white cells need to be filled in (the grey cells are not applicable or automatically
filled by the system).
Cross-check with Part B to see if you will also need to submit a detailed budget table or
outline budgetary details also in Part B.
The budget categories to be used for the call are set out in the call conditions and explained
in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
The budgeted costs should be based on a detailed and accurate estimation of your
estimated project costs (based on the cost eligibility rules set out in the Grant Agreement).
They should include all your estimated costs (those of your Affiliated Entities should be
presented separately, for each participating entity).
Keep your estimates on file — you may be required to produce them later on.
Annexes & supporting documents
If required by the call conditions, you will need to prepare additional annexes and
supporting documents (consortium description, declarations by the national authorities,
CVs, annual activity reports, etc).
Use the templates provided inside the Submission System (NOT the ones on the Topic
page).
Detailed budget table (if required)
Many programmes require the submission of a detailed budget table (templates are usually
in format .xlsx or .xlxm).
Simple .xlsx files can simply be filled-in, merged and uploaded. For .xlsm files, you can
usually — after the table has been filled-in and completed using the macro-support — save
a copy as .xlsx and use that copy for merging and uploading the file.
If you are asked to merge and upload a table as PDF (usually for needed for GAP), please
proceed as follows:
Sheets per participant must be filled in for each Beneficiary/Affiliated Entity; sheets for
the entire project must be filled in by the Coordinator — after having received all the
information by the other participants.
Combine into a single PDF:
1. Save participant sheets into one PDF per Beneficiary/Affiliated Entity (choose
sheets via ‘Options’ when saving as PDF)
2. Save participant sheets and project sheets into a PDF for the Coordinator.
3. Combine into a single PDF for upload (using Adobe Acrobat or the Preview App
on Apple Macs).
4. Upload in the system.
CVs (if required)
Provide CVs for the core project team (these are the key staff you have listed in part B and
may include outside experts, if key to your proposal).
34EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
You can submit CVs in any format. If standard CVs are required in the call conditions we
strongly recommend you to use the Europass format. If short outlines are requested, there
are no specific formatting requirements (but please keep the information on each person
to name, birthdate and 1-2 paragraphs describing studies and most relevant work
experience).
As far as possible, upload them in a single PDF file, rather than individually.
If you are still recruiting, please provide the job profile.
Activity report of last year (if required)
This report should describe your organisation's activities for the last year.
It should be detailed enough to allow us to check your organisation’s aims and activities
and its operational and professional capacity.
No finalised annual report yet? Submit the draft version, certified by your organisation's
legal representative.
No report of this type available? Create one for this application and have it certified by your
legal representative.
Online versions — If your report is available on your website, you can just provide a link
(directly to the document(s), not simply to the homepage) and indicate the link on a
separate sheet and upload it as annex (PDF format).
3.1.4.2 Electronic proposal submission
Electronic proposal submission: Get an EU Login account > Get a PIC number (Participant
Register) > Launch Submission wizard > Pre-register your draft proposal > List participants,
contact persons > Fill in Administrative Forms (Part A) > Upload Technical Description (Part B)
> Submit your proposal > Acknowledgement of receipt
Proposals must be submitted online using the Portal Submission System and before the call
deadline.
Details are explained in the .
Actions to be completed before submission
Create your user account to login to the Portal
To be able to submit a proposal, you must first register on the Portal for an EU Login account.
Make sure all participants are registered (PIC)
All participants (Beneficiaries, Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners) must be
registered in the Participant Register and have their 9-digit Participant Identification Code
(PIC). The Coordinator has to be identified with its PIC number at Step 3 of the Submission
wizard, while other participants at Step 4.
Read more about registration and PIC search in the Registration and validation of your
organisation section.
Submitting the application
35EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The Submission wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process.
Detailed explanations are available in the .
Do not forget to check the system requirements for using the Submission System.
Launch the Submission wizard and enter information for the Administrative
Forms (application form (Part A))
Go to the topic on the Search funding & tenders page > Start Submission.
Upload Part B (Technical Description) and annexes and supporting documents
Part B (and the annexes and supporting documents) can be uploaded in Step 5 of the
wizard. Detailed instructions for preparing these documents are available in the section Get
prepared.
Tips
Do not wait until the end to submit
It is highly recommended to submit your proposalas early as possible and at least 48 hours
before the deadline. This will avoid technical problems (system requirements, local
configuration settings, system congestion, etc).
Please note that you can submit the proposal as many times as you want. Every submitted
version will replace the previous one. Your proposal is sealed and closed. It will not be accessed
before the deadline of the call. There is no reason to delay submission for fear of disclosure.
Affiliated entities
In Step 4 of the wizard you specify the organisations participating in the consortium. As from
2021, this will include Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners. They will therefore need to
have registered beforehand and have their PIC. Their budget will also have to be individualised
already at application stage (separate row in the budget table).
Access rights of individual contact persons
In Step 4 of the wizard you also specify the contact persons for the organisations. To read more
about the levels of access rights, see the Roles and access rights section.
Changes to organisation-related data during proposal preparation
If your organisation is already registered, but organisation-related data has changed during
proposal preparation, you cannot update it directly in the Submission System.
The update must first be requested via the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions >
Modify Organisation):
• by the LEAR (or Account Administrators) for validated entities
• by the Self-registrant if your organisation has not been validated yet.
Page limits and formatting requirements for the Technical Description (Part B)
Don’t forget that applications may have mandatory page limits and formatting requirements
(indicated at the beginning of the application form). Excess pages will be automatically made
invisible, and will not be taken into consideration by the evaluators.
36EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Checklist for submission
Before submitting the proposal, check that:
• your proposal fulfils the call conditions
• the proposal (both the Administrative Forms (Part A) and Technical Description (Part
B)) is complete, readable, accessible and printable
• the requested declarations have been made
• all consortium members have:
obtained a user account to log in to the Portal
o
registered in the Participant Register.
o
Mock evaluation
For some programmes, you can find standard evaluation forms similar to those used by our
evaluators on Portal Reference Documents. Try them out. Ideally, ask a disinterested colleague
to carry out a mock evaluation.
Multiple versions of proposal
You can submit your proposal several times before the deadline, to make updates or changes.
To view or change your submitted proposal, go to My Proposals > View Submitted > Re-edit
proposal. As long as the call has not been closed, the newly submitted version will overwrite
the previous one.
Please note that the re-edit functionality is not available for continuously open calls.
Multiple proposals
If the Coordinator submits a number of similar proposals, the Granting Authority may ask them
to choose one or more of them to be withdrawn.
Specific submission schemes
Two-stage submission schemes — You must submit a short outline proposal for stage 1 and will
be invited to submit a full application only if you pass to stage 2. The full application must be
consistent with the short outline proposal (no substantial differences allowed).
Calls with multiple cut-off dates — The call has a final closure date (usually the end of the
funding programme) and several cut-off dates that trigger evaluation. There is an evaluation
session after each cut-off date and the final closure date (normally within a month). After each
cut-off date, the submitted proposals are grouped, reviewed and ranked together. Evaluation
results are made available and proposals invited for grant preparation. If you miss a cut-off
date, the proposal will be evaluated with the next batch in the next evaluation session.
After submission
At submission, the application package is combined into one document, sealed and an e-receipt
is generated (with date and time of submission).
All contact persons of the coordinating organisation will receive an e-mail (after each submission
if several). If you have not received this e-mail, the application has not been submitted.
Please try again or contact the IT Helpdesk.
After the submission, there is normally no further contact between you and us until after the
end of the evaluation. The competent EU service will contact you only if there is a need to clarify
issues or request additional information or if the call foresees a hearing/interview as part of the
evaluation procedure.
37EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Withdrawal of submitted proposals
Before the call deadline, a proposal can be withdrawn at Step 6 of the wizard (My Proposals >
View Submitted > Withdraw proposal). After the call deadline, withdrawal has to be requested
via the IT Helpdesk.
Once withdrawn, the new status will be shown on the My Proposals page (and you can delete
the application with the Delete button).
After the call deadline
Once the call deadline has passed, no further corrections or re-submissions are possible.
However, you can have read-only access to the submitted proposal (My Proposals > View
Submitted).
Proposals that were never submitted (remain in draft status) are accessible for 90 days after
the call deadline (My Proposals > View Draft).
3.1.5 Complaints about failed submission
If you think that submission of your proposal failed and this was due to a technical error on the
Portal side, you may lodge a complaint through the IT Helpdesk.
The complaint must be filed within 4 calendar days after call closure. You will receive an
acknowledgement of receipt the same or next working day.
What else to do? You should secure a PDF version of the part B and annexes of your application
holding a time stamp before the call deadline (file attributes listing the date and time of creation
and last modification), as well as proof of the alleged failure (screenshots). You may be
requested by the IT Helpdesk to provide these items.
EC services will check the IT logs (application log files and access log files of the Commission
IT systems involved) and see if they show a technical problem on the Portal side which
prevented you from submitting (or resubmitting) the proposal.
You will be notified about the outcome as soon as possible.
If your complaint is justified, the files you provided to the IT Helpdesk will be used as your
proposal and sent for evaluation. If you didn’t provide any files, the last version recorded in the
IT system will be used.

3.2 Selection — From evaluation to grant signature
3.2.1 Admissibility and eligibility check
Once you have submitted a proposal, the Granting Authority will check:
• admissibility (complete and properly put together) and
• eligibility (fulfills eligibility conditions)
and then
• ask an independent evaluation committee to evaluate it.
38EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Admissibility criteria
The admissibility conditions are set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.
They are generally the same across all EU programmes. The proposal must:
• be submitted through the online Submission System before the call deadline
• be complete — application form correctly filled out, all sections of Parts A and B
completed, all annexes and supporting documents provided
• be readable, accessible and printable.
Furthermore, the proposal should respect the page limit set out in the application form. Excess
pages will be automatically made illegible, and will not be taken into consideration by the
evaluators.
Eligibility criteria
The eligibility criteria are also set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.
The basic eligibility check involves for most EU programmes if the content of the proposal is in
line with the topic description and if it involves participants coming from the right countries.
Additional criteria depend on the programme or specific topic (i.e. minimum consortium
composition, type of participant, geographic location of the project activities, coordinator from
an EU country, etc.).
For more information on participation of non-EU participants, see Who can apply section.
Outcome of the admissibility and eligibility check
If a proposal is inadmissible or ineligible, the participants will be informed (through the
coordinating organisation) and the rejection letter will be posted in their Portal library (My
Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Documents).
For complaints procedures against such rejections, see section Complaints about proposal
rejection.
3.2.2 Evaluation
Admissible and eligible proposals are sent on to evaluation by an independent evaluation
committee.
For most programmes the evaluation committee (panel) is made up of EU staff from the
Granting Authority and other services. They are often and assisted by outside experts for
individual evaluation and consensus group evaluation. For some programmes however (e.g.
Horizon Europe), the committee is usually composed exclusively of outside experts — for all
stages of the evaluation process (no internal staff).
The evaluation committee will also take position on the operational capacity of the consortium
and individual participants to properly implement the tasks planned. This assessment will be
based on the competence and experience of the participants, including operational resources
(human, technical and other) and is, for many programmes, integrated into the award criteria.
3.2.2.1 Award criteria
39EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Award criteria, scores thresholds and weighting
Proposals are evaluated and scored against award criteria set out in the call conditions on the
Topic page.
The award criteria, scores, thresholds and weightings depend on each programme and type of
action.
Globally speaking most programmes evaluate the following quality parameters: project
relevance, quality/implementation and impact. But in practice the labels vary and the
parameters are broken down into different aspects and focal points (see call conditions and, for
some programmes, the Programme Guides, e.g. Horizon Europe Programme Guide, Erasmus+
Programme Guide, AGRIP Programme Guide).
To be considered for funding, your proposal must score above a certain threshold for each
individual award criterion, and above an overall threshold for all of them together.
Moreover, in order to receive funding, your proposal must be ranked sufficiently to be above
the budget-threshold (relative positioning in the list of all proposals, compared to the other
proposals). For calls which provide for weightings, this ranking will also depend on the
weighting.
Your proposals will be evaluated on its own merit, and not its potential should certain
changes be made. Proposals with an inflated budget are likely to receive a lower score.
3.2.2.2 Evaluation and evaluation results
Evaluation process
Briefing
Evaluation: Individual evaluation > Consensus group > Panel review
Briefing of evaluators
Before starting the evaluation process, the evaluators are briefed on:
• the evaluation processes and procedures (including award criteria)
• the content of the topics under consideration
• the need to evaluate proposals as they were submitted, rather than their potential
should certain changes be made
• for outside experts: the terms of their contract (confidentiality, impartiality, conflicts of
interest, completing tasks and approving reports, penalties for non-compliance, etc).
For most EU programmes, there is no scope for recommending improvements to proposals
(including improvements on the budget).
Individual evaluation
During the individual evaluation, the evaluators work individually. Each evaluator gives a score
for each criterion, with explanatory comments, and prepares an individual evaluation report
(IER).
40EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Proposals are normally evaluated by at least three individual evaluators (for some programmes
and types of action, two may suffice; for many it is five).
The evaluators should also indicate if they consider that the proposal:
• is out of scope or
• involves security issues that will need further scrutiny.
Consensus group
After the individual evaluation, all evaluators who have evaluated the proposal will get together
in a consensus group, to agree on a common position on comments and scores.
For consensus groups made up of outside experts, the group will normally be assisted by a
member of the Granting Authority staff who will act as moderator to:
• seek a consensus, impartially and
• ensure that each proposal is evaluated fairly, according to the award criteria.
Panel review
After the consensus phase, the evaluation committee (panel) will take over and discuss the
proposals to:
• reach an agreement on the scores and comments for all proposals evaluated together,
checking consistency across the evaluations
• if necessary, propose a new set of marks or revise comments, and resolve cases where
evaluators were unable to agree
• rank the above-threshold proposals and give a priority order for proposals with the same
score.
Proposals with the same score
The evaluation committee will recommend a priority order for proposals with the same score,
using the procedure set out in the call conditions.
Interviews/hearings
If provided for in the call conditions, the evaluation committee (panel) may arrange
interviews/hearings.
In this case, invitations are sent to the coordinators of above-threshold proposals (and,
sometimes, also to those with scores above individual thresholds but below the overall
qualifying threshold).
The interviews/hearings may be held remotely or on site, in Brussels.
The questions to be asked will be determined by the panel beforehand and sent to all proposals.
The interviews/hearings will be used to get further information to clarify the proposals and help
the panel establish its final ranking list and scores. They may not serve to change proposals or
add missing information.
Outcome of evaluation
41EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
On the basis of the report and ranked list provided by the evaluation committee (panel), the
Granting Authority reviews the evaluation result, puts together the final ranking list and
informs the participants.
You can find the timing the evaluation and information on evaluation results in the call
conditions on the Topic page.
Final ranking — Reserve list — Rejections
The Granting Authority produces the final ranked list and the list of applications proposed
for funding.
The number of proposals in the list depends on the available budget. If the available budget is
too small to fund all above-threshold proposals (normally the case because EU grants are
heavily oversubscribed), some proposals may be put on a reserve list. These will then be
offered funding if a higher-scoring project does not go ahead or additional funds become
available.
The below-threshold proposals will be rejected.
Proposals will NOT be offered funding if the Granting Authority finds that it is already funding
very similar work elsewhere, or a proposal is in any way manifestly contrary to EU general
principles or established EU priorities or policies.
Evaluation result letters — Evaluation summary report
The participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) about their evaluation
result (together with the evaluation summary report (ESR)) and it will be posted in their Portal
library (My Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation >
Documents).
If your proposal was successful, you will get a grant preparation invitation letter. To follow
the further steps of preparing your grant, you will be prompted for each of the actions that need
to be carried out. Details are explained in the next section Grant preparation.
42EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please note that invitation to grant preparation is NOT a formal commitment for funding. The
final decision on your project will only be taken at a later stage — this depends on the finalisation
of grant preparation and further checks which we still need to make (i.e. financial capacity, non-
exclusion, etc).
If your proposal was not succesful, you will receive a rejection letter. The means of redress for
such rejections are described in the section Complaints about proposal rejection.
3.2.3 Special procedures: Ethics review, security scrutiny,
Ownership control check
Ethics review
In order to avoid funding of ethically problematic activities, some funding programmes require
an ethics review procedure to clear the projects (e.g. Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, EU4H,
AMIF).
The details and the scope of the ethics review depend on each programme. Most programmes
simply check whether projects raise ethics issues and, if so, whether these are adequately
addressed. Some programmes, such as Horizon Europe, have a more elaborated review
procedure which includes several steps depending on the complexity of the issues (see Horizon
Europe Programme Guide).
The participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) of the ethics review
result and it will be posted in their Portal library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Document Library).
If the ethics review leads to requirements to be implemented before grant signature, you will
need to take immediate action to comply (and may also have to adapt the description of the
action (DoA Part B) to reflect this). If the review leads to additional requirements to be fulfilled
during the project, they are automatically added as ethics deliverables into the system and DoA
Part A and will be placed in an automatically generated work package called ethics
requirements. If the review shows that there are serious ethics issues that cannot be solved,
funding may have to be refused.
You may be asked to provide additional information if this is needed to complete the ethics
review (e.g. in case of serious or complex ethics issues or missing information).
Links
• How to complete your ethics self-assessment
Security scrutiny
In order to ensure that classified information (for EU classified information (EUCI), see Decision
2015/444) is protected from unauthorised disclosure and that security issues emerging from
project activities are appropriately addressed, some EU programmes systematically provide for
a security review procedure for applications that operate in security relevant contexts (e.g.
European Defence Fund, Horizon Europe, Digital Europe).
The details and the scope of the security review depend on each programme. Some
programmes, such as Horizon Europe and Digital Europe, have a more elaborated security
review procedure which includes several steps depending on whether the topic under which a
proposal is submitted is flagged by the Commission as security sensitive or not (see Horizon
Europe Programme Guide).
43EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The security scrutiny (which is the final step of the more elaborated security review) is
essentially the same for all programmes: proposals must be cleared by the Security Scrutiny
Group (composed of national security experts nominated in agreement with their national
security authorities (NSAs)). The Security Scrutiny Group will determine the level of sensitivity
of the application and check whether all security aspects are being handled appropriately. You
will be informed about the result through your coordinator.
If the security scrutiny leads to requirements to be implemented before grant signature, you
will need to take immediate action to comply. If the scrutiny leads to classification and additional
requirements to be fulfilled during the project, this will be automatically reflected in the system
(classification of existing deliverables, limited dissemination of existing deliverables due to
security reasons, security aspect letter (SAL), security classification guide (SCG), appointment
of project security officer, establishment of security advisory board, etc.). If the scrutiny shows
that the project is too security sensitive, funding may have to be refused.
Links
• How to handle security-sensitive projects
Third country control
Some programmes (or calls) limit the participation of entities which are controlled by third
countries (e.g. European Defence Fund, Digital Europe, Horizon Europe, CEF). In this case, a
special procedure is needed to verify ownership control of participants.

3.2.4 Grant preparation
Grant preparation
The Grant Agreement must be prepared directly in the Portal Grant Management System.
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Grant agreement data
preparation.
Who? The Grant Agreement data should be prepared by the consortium participants together
and submitted by the Coordinator.
How? You will be prompted by e-mail for all the actions that you need to carry out for the grant
preparation. For more details, see the list of grant-related notifications.
What? The grant preparation process consists of:
• setting up the Portal Grant Management System with the:
participants’ legal, administrative and financial information
o
description of the action (DoA, Annex 1 GA)
o
estimated budget (Annex 2 and 2a GA)
o
project variables (when the project starts, reporting periods, amount of
o
prefinancing, GA options, etc)
44EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
legal documents needed for grant signature (declarations of honour)
o
• so that the system can generate the Grant Agreement
and
• trigger signature directly inside the system (Grant Agreement and Accession Forms).
In parallel, the Granting Authority will perform the remaining legal checks to ensure that all the
successful proposals can receive EU funding (legal entity validation, financial capacity check,
non-exclusion check, etc).
Our Grant Agreement clauses are common to all EU programmes and mandatory for all
beneficiaries. They are explained in more detail in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
Grant preparation process
Enter & submit grant data: Entering legal, administrative & financial data > Preparing the
Description of the Action (DoA)
Signing the Grant Agreement
Description of the Action (DoA) (Part A and B)
The description of the action (DoA, Annex 1) is structured like the application form into
two parts, Parts A and B:
• Part A: contains the structured tables with project information (retrieved from the Grant
Management System tabs)
• Part B (the narrative part): is based on Part B of the application form and must be
uploaded as a PDF.
Creating Part B of the DoA is straightforward, as it can be derived directly from Part B of the
application. The instructions for this are available on Portal Reference Documents.
The system will merge the Parts A and B, generating a single PDF with the full description of
the action (DoA).
All participants can contribute to the parts, but it is the Coordinator who will have to finalise
and submit it.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Workplan tables: Complete the workplan tables in Part A, (work package descriptions,
deliverables and milestones)
• Check that all PICs have been validated by the Central Validation Service
• Quality check:
Check that the DoA is coherent and that information in Part A and B is consistent.
Some programmes will ask you not to simply attach the application, but to adapt Part
B. In this case, try to avoid overlaps between Parts A and B (delete work plan tables
from Part B, etc).
Check that DoA and the application match: please check if the content of the DoA differs
from the application, as this must be in compliance with your invitation letter to start
grant preparation. In addition, you may correct shortcomings identified by the experts
in the evaluation summary report. The information presented in the DoA can be made
45EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
more consistent if necessary. Any errors should be corrected (data displayed in a table
or figure is at odds with the description, etc).
Check that the DoA and the legal and administrative information match: for example, it
must describe the role and tasks performed by each Partner (Coordinator, Beneficiary,
Affiliated Entity, Third party providing in-kind contributions, etc) defined in the
structured part.
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed and no
annexes are missing.
Termination of grant preparation
If the consortium decides against the grant during grant preparation, they can launch the
termination process directly in the Portal. See the detailed screens and descriptions in the
on grant preparation termination.
This type of termination works only during grant preparation. Afterwards (after grant
signature), the grant must be formally terminated by amending the GA (early termination
amendment).

3.2.4.1 Enter & submit grant data
Actions to be completed before grant preparation
Organise access rights and roles
All Beneficiaries need access rights in order to prepare their grant data in the system and
sign the legal documents (declarations of honour, Grant Agreements and Accession Forms).
The contact persons of each organisation indicated in the proposal will automatically receive
access rights during grant preparation:
Proposal Grant preparation
Person who created the application ou PCoCo
submit the proposal?
Contact persons with full access rights CoCos (for Coordinator) + PaCos (for
other Beneficiaries)
46EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Contact persons with read-only rights Team Members (TeMes)
In addition, if your organisation has already been validated, the LEAR will normally also
already have been appointed.
Other persons and roles (especially LSIGNs and FSIGNs) will have to be appointed first by
the LEAR (My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation Roles > Add Roles) and then
assigned to the project by the CoCos and PaCos (My Projects > Actions > Project
Consortium > Edit Roles).
The minimum setup of roles that you need to prepare and conclude the Grant Agreement
are the following:
• for the Coordinator:
Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo) — already appointed
o
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
o
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN)
o
• for other Beneficiaries:
Participant Contact (PaCo)
o
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
o
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN).
o
The same person can fulfil several or all of the above roles.
Our system allows for only one signature on your side. If your internal rules require
several signatories, you must give an internal mandate to one of them and ensure that the
electronic signature in our system is executed only after all the necessary internal
authorisations were given. These authorisations must be collected, stored and kept by you
in line with your usual management practices (usually paper-based) so that they can be
provided to us in case of EU controls, checks or audits.
More details about nomination are in the Roles and access rights section.
Make sure all participants are registered and validated (PIC)
All Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities must be registered and validated in time for grant
signature (see section on Registration and validation of your organisation).
Associated Partners need to be only registered (have a PIC); no validation is needed,
because they will not receive any grant money.
Prepare and sign a consortium agreement (always recommended; in many
cases mandatory)
Consortium agreements are mandatory for many EU programmes. But even if they are not,
it is highly recommended to have arrangements in place to cover consortium-internal issues
that may arise during the project (e.g. decision-making procedures, resolve conflicts,
safeguard intellectual property rights, etc). The consortium agreement should be signed
before the Grant Agreement. For details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 7
and the How to establish your H2020 consortium agreement.
47EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Enter legal, administrative & financial data
You need to prepare the Grant Agreement in the Portal Grant Management System.
Details are explained in the .
Enter the structured information into the system (Part A of the DoA)
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation
> Grant agreement data preparation and transfer the information from your application
form (Part B) to the Work Packages, Deliverables, Milestones and Critical Risks screens.
You can move work packages up and down by drag & drop to position them in the order of
your preference. When a work package is moved to a new position, the numbering of WPs
(and also the relative numbering of deliverables) is automatically adapted.
Enter the other grant data into the system
a) Set the project starting date
Set the date on which the project is to start (starting date of the action) on the Project
Summary screen.
The options may vary depending on programme and type of action (see call conditions),
but generally there are 2 options:
• the first day of the month after entry into force (signature by EU) — default
option
• if needed, a fixed starting date may be agreed — this should be the first day of
a month and normally after grant signature (unless authorised otherwise by the
Granting Authority).
If you enter a fixed starting date, you will be asked to justify your choice. If you
chose a starting date before grant signature, you must explain why your project requires
this. Please note that the starting date can normally NOT be before the date on which
your application was submitted (unless explicitly allowed in the call conditions). Please
also note that any project activities taking place before grant signature bear the risk
that the grant may finally not be signed.
b) Check the project reporting periods
The reporting periods will be pre-filled for each call on the Reporting Periods screen.
To minimise administrative burden for you, we will choose the smallest possible number
of reporting periods. On average, most programmes tend to have reporting periods
between 12 and 18 months.
c) Check the prefinancing for the project
The standard prefinancing percentage will be pre-filled for each call on the Project
Financial Information screen.
The final prefinancing amount for each project will however be fixed only later, once the
budgetary information is completed from your side and the Granting Authority has
examined the results from the financial capacity assessment (see section Financial
capacity assessment). The prefinancing may be lowered in case of low financial capacity.
48EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
d) Complete the legal and administrative information for the participants
Fill in the missing information for each participant on the Partner Summary screen and
complete the Affiliated Entities and Associated Partner screens.
e) Define the budgets for the participants
Fill in the budget for each participant on the Partner Financial Information screens.
Make sure the budget details match the proposal and the GAP invitation letter (and the
detailed budget table, if required).
f) Provide the banking details for the Coordinator
Select the bank account to be used for payments from the dropdown menu on the
Coordinator’s Bank Account screen.
If your preferred bank account is not listed, you must ask your LEAR to add the bank
account in the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
Once the new bank account has been validated (this may take a few days), it will appear
in the dropdown menu and you will be able to select it.
f) Enter other information as prompted
Upload Part B of the description of the action (DoA)
Upload Part B on the Documents screen. Follow the instructions from Portal Reference
Documents.
Sign the declarations of honour (DoH)
For each Beneficiary, the PLSIGN must sign a declaration of honour (DoH) directly in the
system (grant declaration) .
Affiliated entities also need to sign a DoH. For them, the responsible Beneficiary must
download the template from Portal Reference Documents, ask each entity to complete and
sign it, then upload the scanned DoHs for their linked third parties.
Joint and several liability of Affiliated Entities (if required)
If the Granting Authority requires joint and several liability of an Affiliated Entity, the
declaration on joint and several liability must be submitted together with the Accession
Form.
The Beneficiary must download the form prepared by the system, ask the Affiliated Entity
to sign it and upload the scanned declaration when signing the Accession Form.
For more details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 22.
Prefinancing guarantee (if required)
If the Granting Authority requires a prefinancing guarantee, you need to obtain this from
a bank or approved financial institution (using the template available on Portal Reference
Documents), send a scanned copy through Portal Formal Notifications (My Projects >
Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) and
the original by registered post with proof of delivery to the mail address of the service
responsible for your grant.
49EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
For more details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 23.
Submit grant preparation to the Granting Authority
Assessment by the Granting Authority and finalisation of GA data
The Project Officer will enter the EU grant preparation data (GA options, etc) and check the
data submitted by the consortium. If needed, they will send back the session to the
consortium for changes/addition information (ping-pong).
Tips
Changes to consortium composition/project during grant preparation
Please note that consortia/projects can be altered ONLY under exceptional circumstances,
and ONLY if duly justified.
Nonetheless, there may be circumstances where you may need to change/adjust the consortium
composition/project before grant signature (bankruptcy, merger/acquisition, loss of a key
member of staff that is needed to carry out the project, etc).
In this case, your Coordinator should contact the EU Project Officer explain why and propose a
solution (reassign tasks and budget within the consortium or to a new participant, adjustments
to the project, etc).
If accepted, you may need to update the Grant Management System screens and upload a new
Part B.
Please note that the proposals may NOT be substantially changed and that all changed
elements must comply with the call conditions for the call. Redistribution of tasks must be in
line with the competences of the participants concerned and the quality of the
project/consortium must be guaranteed.
If no acceptable solution is presented, we will request you to withdraw the proposal and
terminate grant preparation.
Deadlines
In the interest of all sides, we will try to handle grant preparation as swiftly as possible (ideally
3 months after you receive the GAP invitation letter).
To make this happen, we will ask you to comply with relatively strict deadlines during grant
preparation:
• Preparation grant data & annexes (first version): 3 weeks after GAP invitation letter
• Finalisation grant data & annexes: up to 2 weeks after reply by Project Officer
• Sign declaration of honour (DoH): at the latest 6 weeks after GAP invitation letter.
• Grant signature: 3 months from GAP invitation letter
Deadlines can be extended under exceptional circumstances by the EU Project Officer.
Please note that if you have not been granted an extension, and fail to meet the established
deadlines, preparation of your Grant Agreement may be terminated and your proposal rejected.
3.2.4.2 Final legal checks
50EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
During grant preparation, we will also finalise the mandatory legal checks (legal entity
validation, operational and financial capacity, exclusion and double funding).
In case of issues, we may need to contact you.
3.2.5 Grant signature
Signing the Grant Agreement is the last step of the grant preparation phase. It is done directly
in the Portal Grant Management System (electronic signature) and demonstrates that both
contracting parties formally approve the agreement and its annexes.
The Grant Agreement enters into force with the last signature (normally the EU because the
Coordinator usually signs first).
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Sign.
Who? The Grant Agreement is signed by the EU and the Coordinator. The other Beneficiaries
do not sign the Grant Agreement itself, but accede to the Grant Agreement through Accession
Forms. Affiliated Entities or Associated Partners do not sign and do not become formal parties
to the Agreement.
How? You will receive e-mail notifications prompting the tasks needed for grant signature. For
more detail, see the list of grant-related notifications.
Signing EU Grant Agreements electronically —
What's involved?
The electronic signature in the Portal requires:
• a chain of trust with Beneficiaries — to guarantee signatories' identity
• a system of digital signatures protected by multiple security features — to guarantee
documents' reliability and authenticity
This type of electronic signature is used for signature of contracts, amendments and cost claims
(Financial Statements and invoices).
The chain of trust
LEAR
The Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR) appointed by the Beneficiary’s legal
representative (signed LEAR documents uploaded in the Participant Register) is the
centrepiece of the chain of trust. More in the section LEAR appointment and validation.
LEAR appoints all LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation
The LEAR vouches for the organisation data entered into the system and the nominated
persons. They appoint the individuals authorised to sign:
51EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Grant Agreements and amendments (Legal Signatories, known as LSIGNs)
• Financial Statements (Financial Signatories, known as FSIGNs).
The LEAR is responsible for keeping these lists constantly updated.
PaCO selects LSIGN and FSIGN for project
Participant Contacts (PaCo) or Coordinator Contacts (CoCos) have to select the Project
Legal Signatories (PLSIGNs) and Financial Signatories (PFSIGNs) from the LSIGN and
FSIGN lists nominated by the LEAR. For more information, check the section on Roles and
access rights.
Closed system where access rights are strictly controlled.
The chain of trust is built in a closed electronic exchange system. Each individual must
identify themselves with their personal EU Login account and access is strictly controlled.
Signing the Grant Agreement
Sign the declarations of honour (DoH)
Before the Grant Agreement can be signed, the PLSIGN of each Beneficiary must sign a
declaration of honour (grant declaration). For more details, see Enter legal administrative
& financial grant data.
Grant agreement ready for signature
The system prepares the Grant Agreement for signing (PDF document, digitally sealed to
guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).
Coordinator signs the Grant Agreement
The Coordinator's PLSIGN logs into the Portal My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Sign.
52EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
During signature, a pop-up explains that this means the signatory is preparing to sign. It
then asks the PLSIGN to confirm that they wish to sign and a second prompt asks the
PLSIGN to enter their EU Login password.
After signature, the system creates a new version of the PDF document (with a digital seal,
a time stamp, and the signatory's EU Login credentials on the signature placeholder). The
validity of the signature can be verified by opening it in a compatible PDF reader and clicking
on the image of the digital signature.
The Grant Agreement can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature)
from the Documents screen if desired.
The LEAR of the Coordinator and the other Beneficiaries are informed that the Coordinator
has signed the Grant Agreement.
Granting authority signs the Grant Agreement
The EU Authorising Officer is prompted to countersign the Grant Agreement from their side
(same procedure as under point 3).
The Participants will be informed and the countersigned Grant Agreement will be available
in their Portal Library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Document Library).
Participants sign the Accession forms
All other Beneficiaries' PLSIGNs are prompted to sign their Accession Forms (same
procedure as under point 3) — within 30 days after entry into force (signature by EU).
The CoCos and LEAR of the Coordinator and PaCo and LEAR of the concerned Beneficiary
are notified when an Accession Form has been signed.
Grant Agreement is finalised
Not signed Grant Agreement
• If the Coordinator does not sign, the Granting Authority may stop preparing the grant
and reject the proposal.
• If a Beneficiary does not sign the Accession Form within 30 days of the Grant Agreement
entering into force, the Granting Authority may terminate the Grant Agreement. In this
case, in order to continue with the project, the Coordinator must: request an
amendment, so that any changes needed to ensure that the project is carried out
properly can be made.
This request must be made within 30 days after the missed deadline for signing
o
the Accession Form.
The request for an amendment does not affect the Granting Authority's right to
o
terminate the Grant Agreement.
The Accession Form template is available for information on Portal Reference
Documents.
Project starting date
The project starting date is calculated as from the entry into force of the Grant Agreement (last
signature = signature by the EU).
53EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Prefinancing
The entry into force and starting date also determine the baseline date for the prefinancing (i.e.
the float that we normally pay immediately after grant signature).
Depending on the programme (see call conditions), prefinancing is either paid 30 days from:
• Horizon Europe, Digital, SMP, etc: the entry into force or 10 days before the starting
date or submission of the prefinancing guarantee (if required) — depending on which
is the latest
or
• CEF, LIFE, EMFAF, Erasmus, etc: the entry into force or submission of the prefinancing
guarantee (if required) — depending on which is the latest.

3.2.6 Complaints about proposal rejection
If you believe that the rejection of your proposal was based on an error in the selection
procedure, you can submit a complaint (following the deadlines and procedures set out in the
evaluation result letter).
Generally, the means of redress are the following:
• request for admissibility/eligibility or evaluation review (redress review) — within 30
days of receiving the letter
• for decisions by EU executive agencies: request for review of legality under Article 22
of Regulation 58/2003 — within 1 month of receiving the letter (using the Article 22
complaints form template)
• action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU — within 2 months of receiving the letter.
You are free to choose any of the above means of redress. However, in the interest of good
administration and procedural efficiency, it is recommended to use first the available
administrative review procedures (if any). The objective of these procedures is to re-examine
the circumstances of the selection procedure and to reach a final decision on your application.
Deadlines for further redress will therefore run as from when you receive our reply with the
final position.
Please note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending are
considered to have been accessed and that the deadlines will be counted from opening/access
(see Portal Terms and Conditions).
Complaints will be subject to the following conditions:
• Complaints must focus on aspects concerning the evaluation of the proposals (e.g.
admissibility or eligibility checks, evaluation procedure, etc), not their merits. Thus,
applicants can raise procedural irregularities, factual errors, manifest errors of
assessment or abuse of powers (e.g. lack of coherence between scores and comments,
lack or inadequate reasoning of the conclusions, the existence of a conflict of interests,
exceeding the limits of discretion, etc). Mere repetitions of the content of the proposal
or disagreements with the result or reasoning of the technical evaluation will not be
considered.
54EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Only one request for review per proposal will be considered. The request cannot refer
to the evaluation of proposals submitted by other applicants or under different or
previous calls.
• Review requests will not always necessarily also lead to a re-evaluation of your proposal
(new technical evaluation with new group of evaluators). The administrative review
procedure will re-examine your case, but a re-evaluation will be decided only if your
complaint demonstrates that the procedural irregularity, factual error, manifest error of
assessment or abuse of powers affects the decision on whether to fund the proposal.
Thus, for example, a problem relating to one of the evaluation criteria will not lead to a
re-evaluation if, even by adding the maximum points under this criterion, the final score
of the proposal would still remain below the threshold for funding.
• Re-evaluations will be made on the proposal as it was originally submitted; no additional
information will be admitted. Re-evaluations will be partial (limited to the criterion
affected by the error) or full (when the whole evaluation has been recognized as flawed)
— depending on the case. They may be assigned to the same evaluation panel or a new
one, depending on the internal procedures of the Granting Authority.
• The score following a re-evaluation may be lower than the original score.
• All requests for review will be treated as confidential.
Please pay attention to who took the formal decision and who the complaint must be addressed
to. If a decision was taken by an EU executive agency or other EU body, both redress review
and applications for annulment must be directed against that agency/body (NOT against the
European Commission). Only Article 22 complaints must be addressed to the respective
Directorate-General of the Commission (parent DG of the executive agency).
In case you consider that there has been maladministration on our part, you can also address
a complaint to the European Ombudsman — within 2 years after you became aware of it AND
after having used all the means of administrative redress available (redress and Article 22
request, if any).
3.3 Grant management
3.3.1 Keeping records
All participants must keep records and other supporting documentation in order to prove
the proper implementation and the costs claimed (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art
20).
For Lump Sum grants, records on costs incurred are exceptionally NOT needed; it is enough to
keep the evidence to prove the proper implementation of the action.

3.3.2 Amendments
Amendments requested by the consortium
55EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If there are any changes to the Grant Agreement (e.g. data or options specific to that
agreement) or its annexes, they must be done through a formal amendment directly in the
Portal (electronic signature).
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Request for Amendment.
Who? Amendments can be prepared by the consortium participants together, but only the
Coordinator can launch, sign and submit them.
The EU Granting Authority can also propose amendments, but for practical reasons we will often
as you to initiate the procedure.
When? Amendments must normally be done before the end of the project, but some
amendment clauses are also open afterwards (addition of Beneficiary/Affiliated
Entity/Associated Partner, change of Coordinator, change of Annex 1, change of Annex 2,
change of bank account, error amendments, etc).
What? Cases requiring a formal amendment are listed in the AGA — Annotated Grant
Agreement, art 39. See also How to prepare an amendment in the .
Amendments are normally NOT necessary for:
• budget transfers covered by the budget flexibility
• name or address changes of a participant — done directly in the Participant Register
• universal takeovers (merger/acquisition) of a participant — done directly in the
Participant Register
• changes of the banking details — done directly in the Participant Register.
The signed amendment is the legal document containing the changes to the Grant
Agreement. It is legally binding and will be incorporated into the Agreement. The consolidated
version is only for information.
Amendment process
Get ready > Launch amendment > Amendment preparation > Consult Commission >
Sign&Submit > Assessment > Countersign
Amendment request
The amendment request consists of:
• updated structured information on the Grant Management System screens
• amendment request letter: the letter with the request and reasons for the amendment
• amendment core (including new version of GA Annexes 1 and 2, if needed): the legal
document with the list of amendment clauses
• supporting documents: documents uploaded by the consortium, consolidated Grant
Agreement, etc
All participants can contribute to the amendment, but it is the Coordinator who will have to
launch, finalise, submit and sign the request.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
56EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Check that the updated information Grant Management System screens is correct.
• Quality check: Check that the Amendment documents are correct and all supporting
documents attached.
Actions to be completed before amendment
Make sure new participants are registered and validated (PIC)
New Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities must be registered and validated in the Participant
Register before the amendment can be requested (see section on Registration and
validation of your organisation).
Associated Partners need to be only registered (have a PIC); no validation is needed,
because they will not receive any grant money from us.
Make sure that new bank accounts are registered and validated
New banking information must be registered and validated in the Participant Register
before an amendment can be requested (see section on Bank account registration and
validation).
Submitting an amendment
Amendments must be prepared in the Portal Grant Management System.
Details are explained in the .
Get ready
Before launching your amendment request, prepare the supporting documents and, if
needed, discuss the request beforehand with the EU Project Officer (— recommended for
more complicated cases).
Launch the amendment
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU >
Request for Amendment
Amendment reference number (ID) — Once you have launched the request, the
amendment is automatically assigned a reference number. Please use this unique identifier
in all contacts with the Granting Authority during the amendment process.
Change the grant data in the system
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Amendment > Amendment preparation.
Once the amendment is been launched, you can amend the grant data in the same way as
as you did when preparing the Grant Agreement.
Enter the amendment information into the system
a) Justification
57EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Fill out the field to justify the request on the Amendment Information screen.
b) Amendment clauses
On the basis of the changes to the grant data, the system will automatically select the
relevant amendment types (automatic clauses) on the Amendment Information screen.
Other types of amendment have to be selected manually by the EU Project Officer,
(change of Annex 1, change in the maximum grant amount, resuming the action after
suspension, etc). Contact the Project Officer to activate the clause.
In case a change triggers the need for another change, a prompt will appear.
Upload annexes and supporting documents
You will be prompted to upload mandatory supporting documents. These depend on the
type of amendment and the specific case (e.g. a new Beneficiary must provide the DoH
and the Accession Form).
Consult Granting Authority
Once ready, the amendment request must be submitted to the Granting Authority for
informal assessment.
Informal assessment by the Granting Authority
The Project Officer will check that the amendment request is correct and admissible. If
needed, they will send it back to the consortium for changes/additional information (ping-
pong).
Coordinator signs & submits the amendment request
Once the request for an amendment is complete and ready to be submitted, the system
generates the 2 documents (amendment request letter and amendment core) for signature
(PDF document, digitally signed to guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).
The Coordinator’s PLSIGN logs into My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Amendment
> Sign & Submit (same procedure as for Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant
Agreement).
The amendment can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature) from
the Documents screen if desired.
As Coordinator, you cannot alter a request for an amendment once it has been signed
and submitted. There are 2 options:
• You withdraw it.
• The Granting Authority rejects it (amendment rejection letter).
Formal assessment by the Granting Authority
The Granting Authority has 45 days to accept or reject the request.
This deadline will be extended if needed (e.g. if the amendment are complex, specific
compliance checks are needed for a new participant, or if the project has to be reviewed to
assess the changes).
58EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Granting authority signs the amendment
Acceptance: If the Granting Authority accepts the request, they countersign it from their
side (same procedure as for Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant Agreement).
The Coordinator and Beneficiaries will be informed and the countersigned amendment will
be available in their Portal Library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Project
Library).
Rejection: If the request is rejected, the consortium will be informed by amendment
rejection letter.
Amendment number — Once the amendment is countersigned, it is automatically assigned
a sequential amendment number (1, 2, 3, etc). For instance, an amendment request with
the reference AMD-345622-6 is assigned number 2 if it is the 2nd signed amendment for
the grant. Rejected amendments are assigned a number (R1, R2); but they are saved, so
that they can be reused to draw up a new request.
The Coordinator’s PLSIGN can withdraw a submitted request until it is countersigned.
Withdrawn requests are saved and can be reused to submit a new request.
Entry into force & taking effect
An amendment proposed by a consortium enters into force on the day the Granting Authority
signs it.
It takes effect (i.e. the changes to the Grant Agreement start to apply) either:
• on a specific date specified in the amendment or
• on the date of entry into force (last signature = signature by the EU).
Depending on the nature of the amendment, the date on which it takes effect may affect
the eligibility of costs (e.g. if a Beneficiary is added, costs are eligible from the accession date
specified in the Accession Form).
Coordinator change without their agreement
If the Coordinator is to be replaced without their agreement, another Beneficiary (acting on
behalf of the other Beneficiaries in the consortium) must submit the amendment request.
To do this, you will need to contact the EU Project Officer, so that they can give you
(exceptional) PCoCo access rights in the system.
Please note you will have to provide proof both of the consortium decision to change the
Coordinator, to nominate you to act on their behalf AND the opinion of the changed Coordinator
(or at least proof that the opinion was requested) — otherwise the termination will be considered
improper.
Amendments initiated by the Granting Authority
If the Granting Authority requests an amendment, the request is also prepared and signed
electronically in the Portal Grant Management System.
You will receive an e-mail notification prompting you to accept the request.
To do so, the Coordinator's PLSIGN must countersign the amendment on the consortium's
behalf.

3.3.3 Continuous reporting on milestones & deliverables
During the project, you are expected to provide regular updates on the status of the project:
the continuous reporting.
The continuous reporting includes:
• progress in achieving milestones
• deliverables
• updates to the publishable summary
• response to critical risks, publications, communications activities, IPRs
• programme-specific monitoring information (if required).
Where? The Continuous Reporting Module is accessible through the link you receive at the
beginning of the project.
Who? Milestones and deliverables should be submitted by each participant for their work.
What? You should report on milestones and deliverables in accordance with the schedule set
out for them.
The Continuous Reporting Module also allows you to report on critical risks, prepare the
summary for publication and the programme-specific information on indicators (e.g. Trainings,
Gender, Open Data, etc — if available for your programme and type of action).
Milestones — Control points in the project that help to chart progress (kick-off meetings,
steering committes, first-draft of a survey, prototype, etc). They may correspond to the
completion of a key deliverable, which allows the next phase of the work to begin or is needed
at intermediary points.
Deliverables — Outputs to be submitted to the EU (publication, leaflet, progress report,
brochure, list, etc).
All this information is automatically compiled to create part A of the periodic Technical Report,
at the moment this report is prepared (Locked for review).
Reporting in the Continuous Reporting Module
At the beginning of the project, you will receive a notification (+ link) that the Continuous
Reporting Module is activated and that you can contribute to it on an ongoing basis.
Detailed information on the Module can be found in the .
Update the project summary
60EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please note that you must provide a separate summary for each periodic report (just
update the summary for the previous period).
The summary must be suitable for direct publication by the Granting Authority,
especially:
• be a stand-alone text — no references to other parts of the report, only to publicly
available information.
• easily understandable by a general audience
• preferably not longer than 7,480 characters (roughly 2 pages)
• with no confidential/sensitive data
You can upload diagrams or photographs illustrating and promoting your project work (
only as images and you must have cleared any rights of third parties advance).
You can also mention the websites used to promote the EU project (see section
Communicating and promoting the project).
Update the deliverables
The deliverables must be submitted according to the timing specified in the Continuous
Reporting section.
At the time the periodic report is submitted, check if all deliverables due have been
provided and, if not, give an explanation in the Comments column (especially for missing
or late deliverables and/or cancelled or grouped deliverables).
Update the milestones
Specify whether the milestones were achieved or not. If not, enter an estimate of when.
The milestones table included in each periodic report is cumulative (it shows all milestones
from the beginning of the project).
Update the critical risks
Assess the state of play of the listed risks and if necessary specify new mitigation
measures or add newly identified risks.
Programme-specific monitoring information (if required)
Some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) have additional policy-monitoring screens on
indicators which require input (Publications, Dissemination, Patents (IPR), SME
participation, Gender, Infrastructure, Innovation, Open data, ABS Regulation, Trainings).

3.3.4 Reports & payment requests
61EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
In order to receive payments, the consortium must submit periodic reports (following the
schedule set out in the Grant Agreement). When these are due, they must be submitted directly
in the Periodic Reporting Module of the Portal Grant Management System.
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Technical Part contribution/Financial Statement
drafting.
Who? The periodic report should be prepared by the consortium participants together and
submitted by the Coordinator.
How? You will be prompted by e-mail for all the actions that you need to carry out for the
periodic reporting.
What? In the periodic report, you should report on the progress of the work and costs claimed
(see below Periodic Report). When the Coordinator submits the periodic report, the IT tool will
capture the information from the Continuous Reporting Module in order to generate the Part A
of the Technical Report. The system will also consolidate the Individual Financial Statements
and it will generate the use of resources report (if required) and the Summary Financial
Statements (for the consortium).
Reporting process
Continuous reporting > Preparing your periodic report > Approving Partners' reports >
Submitting the report to the Commission > Acceptance or rejection by the Commission >
Interim payment
Periodic report: Technical Report (Part A and B) and Financial Report
The periodic report consists of two parts, the Technical Report and Financial Report.
The Technical Report is itself also divided in two parts, Parts A and B:
Part A: contains the structured tables with project information (retrieved from the Grant
Management System).
Part B (the narrative part): mirrors the application form and requires the participants to report
on differences (delays, work not implemented, new subcontracts, budget overruns etc). It must
be uploaded as PDF document.
The Financial Report consists of the structured individual and consolidated Financial
Statements (retrieved from the Grant Management System). In addition, most programmes
require either a detailed cost reporting table (excel table) or the use of resources report (online
wizard) and, for payments above a certain thresholds, a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS).
The technical report Part A and the financial report is generated automatically on the basis of
the data in the Grant Management System; Part B needs to be prepared outside the tools (using
62EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
the template downloaded from the system) and then uploaded as PDF (together with Annexes,
if any).
All participants should contribute to the parts, but it is the Coordinator who will have to submit
them as a single report.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Check that the Continuous Reporting Module is updated in time (before the Periodic
Report is Locked for review).
• Check that all participants have submitted their Financial Statements (and CFS, if
needed)
• Quality checks:
Check that the Report is coherent and that information in Part A and B is consistent.
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed and no
annexes are missing.
Certificate on the Financial Statements (CFS)
The CFS is a report produced by an independent auditor (or, for public bodies, public officer)
using the template available on Portal Reference Documents. Its purpose is to give assurance
to the Granting Authority about the regularity of the costs claimed.
The thresholds depend on the EU programme and type of action (see call conditions on the
Topic page). For the MFF 2021-2027, there is usually a single threshold of EUR 325 000
requested EU contribution.
Please note that costs already audited by the Granting Authority do not have to be covered
again by the CFS (the EU contribution covered by the audit can therefore be excluded from the
calculation of the threshold).
The CFS must be uploaded as a scanned copy (PDF) together with the Financial Statement. The
originals must be kept in the your files.
Submitting the periodic reports
You should start preparing the periodic report in the Grant Management System right after the
periodic reporting is opened at the end of each reporting period (— deadline for submission is
normally 60 days).
Details on how to submit are available in the .
Make sure that the information in the Continuous Reporting Module is updated
This must be done before the Technical Report (both parts) is first Locked for review by
the Coordinator. Any entries into the Continuous Reporting Module made afterwards will
NOT be included in this periodic report.
Complete your Financial Statements
63EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Financial Statement
drafting and complete the Financial Statements for each participant on their Financial
Statement screen.
Make sure the cost details match the use of resources or detailed budget table (if required).
To sign and submit to the Coordinator, the Beneficiary’s PFSIGN must log into My Projects
> Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Sign & Submit (same procedure as for
Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant Agreement).
Affiliated Entities must supply their Beneficiary with a signed paper Financial Statement;
the Beneficiary must then fill in the information in the system and sign and submit.
If you fail to submit a Financial Statement, your costs will be considered zero for this
reporting period (but you can declare them in the next reporting period).
Upload Part B of the technical report
Upload Part B on the Technical Report Part B screen (as a single PDF). Use the template
available inside the system. This can be done by any Beneficiary (not only the Coordinator).
If any changes to Part B are needed, you must delete the pdf file and upload a new one.
When both Parts A and B are ready to submit, the Technical Report can be finalised by the
Coordinator (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Accept &
Include).
Coordinator approves Partners' financial reports
The Coordinator must review and explicitly approve the periodic report. If needed, you can
send back a Financial Statement to a Partner for further changes, or unlock the Technical
Report for editing.
Before submitting, all the accepted Partners' Financial Statements must be included (My
Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Include).
Missing statements
Sometimes you may decide to submit the report without Financial Statements from certain
Partners (e.g. if a Beneficiary cannot submit its individual Financial Statement on time). If
this happens, you will be asked to confirm that you are aware of this and that therefore
these costs will not be considered for the current payment. The participant's costs will be
considered zero for this reporting period, but they will be able to declare their costs in the
next financial report (next reporting period).
Submit the report to the Granting Authority
The Coordinator must submit all parts of the periodc report together (all the individual
Financial Statements and Part B of the Technical Report): My Projects > Actions > Manage
Project > Periodic Reporting > Submit to EU. The system will automatically generate the
report with explanations of the use of resources and the periodic Summary Financial
Statements, which includes the request for payment.
Acceptance or rejection by the Granting Authority
The Granting Authority will either:
• accept the report and start preparing the payment or
64EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• ask for changes to it — which means that the process described above starts
again.
Payment
When the Granting Authority approves the payment, the amount due will be paid out to
the Coordinator (within 90 days of receiving the report)
If the amount due is above the interim payment ceiling (90% of the maximum grant
amount), the amount due will be lowered.
The Granting Authority will send a letter to inform about the payment. After receiving the
letter, the Coordinator has 30 days to submit observations, if needed. In case of
observations, the Granting Authority will send a confirmation letter to state its final
position.
Final report
The Periodic Reporting Module (and periodic reports) are also used for the final report (report
for the last reporting period, to close the grant). The system behaviour, screens and documents
used are the same.
Beneficiary termination reporting
If one of the Beneficiaries has to leave the consortium, the the Coordinator has to prepare a
termination report (Technical Report Part B and Financial Report) and a report on the
distribution of payments to this Beneficiary in the Grant Management System.
Details on the steps to follow are explained in the .

3.3.5 Communicating your project — Acknowledgement of EU
funding
Since the EU grants are financed by public funds, EU Beneficiaries are generally expected to
actively engage in communication activities, to promote the projects and to publicly
acknowledge the EU support.
Communicating and promoting the project
65EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
What does communication involve?
The communication activities must already be part of the proposal (either as a specific work
package for communication or by including them in another work package). Communication will
be taken into consideration as part of the award criteria.
A good communication plan should define clear objectives (adapted to various relevant
target audiences) and set out a description and timing for each activity.
With your communication activities you should draw the attention (general and specialised
audiences) to the EU policy area addressed by the call.
Regarding typical communication activities (and indicators to measure them), you can refer to
the communication network indicators we use for our own communication activities.
In addition, some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) may have more targeted communication
guidance (see Horizon Europe Programme Guide).
Good communication
• Starts at the outset of the action and continues throughout its entire lifetime
• Is strategically planned and not just ad-hoc efforts
• Identifies and sets clear communication objectives (e.g. have final and intermediate
communication aims been specified? what impact is intended? what reaction or change
is expected from the target audience?)
• Is targeted and adapted to audiences that go beyond the project's own community,
including the media and the public
• Chooses relevant messages (e.g. how does the action's work relate to our everyday
lives? why does the target audience need to know about the action?)
• Uses the right medium and means (e.g. working at the right level — local, regional,
national, EU-wide; using the right ways to communicate — one-way exchange (website,
press release, brochure, etc) or two-way exchange (exhibition, school visit, internet
debate, et.); where relevant, include measures for public/societal engagement on issues
related to the action)
• Is proportionate to the scale of the action.
Acknowledgement of EU funding
Beneficiaries of EU funding must display the EU flag and funding statement (“Funded by the
European Union” or “Co-funded by the European Union”) in all their communication and
dissemination activities and any infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, supplies or major result
results funded by the grant.
The EU flag and funding statement must be displayed in a way that is easily visible for the public
and with sufficient prominence.
EU funding must moreover be acknowledged in all types of public outputs (including patent
applications, EU standardisation of results), media contacts and other public statements.
The EU flag and funding statement are available in the Grant Agreement and on the Europa
website.

3.3.6 Dissemination & exploitation of project results
Since EU grants are financed by public funds, EU Beneficiaries moreover also expected to
disseminate their project results. In this way, the projects can benefit a larger group of persons
and reach wider target groups.
Several programmes will therefore ask you to upload results on dedicated results portals
(accessible through the Portal Projects & Results page).
Some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) will require more extensive dissemination and
exploitation activities (e.g. open access, exploitation obligation, etc; see Horizon Europe
Programme Guide).
In case of specific questions on intellectual property, the EU IP Helpdesk may provide support.

3.3.7 Checks, audits, reviews & investigations
In order to ensure sound financial management and compliance with the Grant Agreement
rules, the Granting Authority will perform project reviews and financial audits on participants.
For lump sum grants, since they do not use actual costs, there will be no financial audits focusing
on costs. Reviews will focus on the technical implementation of the action or other aspects of
the Grant Agreement.
Project reviews
The Granting Authority will regularly monitor the project implementation and check the proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the Grant Agreement obligations, including
assessing deliverables and reports.
In addition, the Granting Authority may also carry out in-depth project reviews. Those reviews
focus typically on the technical implementation of the project, but may also cover financial and
budgetary aspects or compliance with other obligations under the GA.
Audits
In addition, most programmes perform financial audits of participants in EU projects (often with
the help of outside audit firms).
Such audits will be performed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. The
auditors comply with ethical requirements and will plan and perform relevant procedures in line
with the EU Grants Indicative Audit Programme, in order to obtain reasonable assurance that
the Financial Statements are free of material misstatement.
You will receive a draft audit report on which you will be able to provide your observations.
If systemic errors are found, the Granting Authority may extend the findings of the audit
results to non-audited Grant Agreements or non-audited periods.
67EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Anti-fraud strategy — OLAF investigations
In case of fraud suspicions, the Granting Authority will inform the European Anti-fraud Office
(OLAF), who may conduct more in-depth investigations.
OLAF also cooperates with national authorities (through information exchange, on-the-spot
checks, coordination of forensic audits etc).
Related Certifications
Certificate on the methodology for unit cost (CoMUC)
The CoMUC is a factual report produced by an independent auditor (using the template available
on Portal Reference Documents). Its purpose is to enable the granting authority to:
• identify your usual cost accounting practices
• check that you have used a suitable unit cost accounting methodology.
Submitting a CoMUC methodology certificate is voluntary. Doing so will help prevent problems
later on, if your grant is audited. If the certificate is approved, costs declared in line with this
methodology will not be challenged, unless you have concealed information for the purpose of
the approval.
For the MFF 2021-2027, only CEF and Digital Europe will be using this certification. For Horizon
Europe it has been replaced by the SPA (systems and process audit; see AGA — Annotated
Grant Agreement, art 24).
The certificate may be requested at any time during the implementation of the programme.
As a minimum, one project should have been started and the data available must give the
auditor enough of a basis to carry out the necessary procedures. Ideally, we would recommend
submitting the methodology after at least one reporting period has passed.
In case of subsequent changes to your methodology you should notify the Granting Authority.
You may also submit a new certificate reflecting the changes.

7. Working as an expert
69EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Introduction
The EU services managing grants and tenders frequently make use of different types of
independent experts to assist them with the implementation, evaluation and monitoring of their
funding programmes. These include:
• Evaluators
• Observers
• Ethics evaluators
• Monitors
• Ethics monitors
• business coaches
As an expert you perform this work as an independent individual and do NOT represent a
company or organisation.
The EU services recruit experts from the Portal Expert Database, where you can register at
any time. Registration is open to experts of any nationality including those outside of the EU
and Associated Countries.
To find out exactly what type of knowledge and skills we are looking for, see call for expression
of interest.
Working as an expert in short:
• Place of work: All or part of the evaluation and monitoring may be carried out at your
home or place of work (remote evaluation), or at the offices of the service concerned
(usually Brussels or Luxembourg), depending on the type of work to be done. Project
review sessions and audits, involving project representatives, may take place either at
the service’s offices or on the Beneficiaries' premises.
• Conflicts of interest: You will NOT be appointed for proposals or projects if you have
a vested interest that could influence the way you evaluate them. For more detail, please
see the section on Contracting and payments and the Model Contract for Experts.
• Confidentiality: If you are going to be handling classified information, you will need
security clearance before you can sign a contract.
• Remuneration: As an expert, you will normally receive EUR 450 for each full day
worked. However for remote evaluation and ethics review, we have developed a new
simplified methodology to calculate the amounts, please see details in the contracting
& payment section. Your travel and subsistence costs will be refunded.
• Amount of work: Projects are usually monitored and evaluated in sessions lasting 15
days a year at most. The number of proposals you assess will largely depend on the
area concerned. An independent expert may normally earn up EUR 90 000 in a four
calendar year period (counting fees only and at the current rate this equals 200 days).

7.1 Expert registration
Registering as an expert
To work as expert, you will first need to register.
To register, go to the Experts' page on the Funding & Tenders Portal. To access the registration
forms, you'll need an EU Login account, which you can set-up on the same website if you don't
yet have one.
Once you've done this, you can log in to your account any time and view, update or complete
your profile in “My Expert Area”.
Click on the "Register as an expert" button. To create your profile, you'll need to specify:
• personal details, knowledge of languages, education and training
• area of expertise
• professional experience (employment, past involvement in EU research programmes,
publications or other achievements...)
To find out exactly what type of knowledge and skills we are looking for, see the call for
expression of interests.
Privacy
Once you have completed all sections and your profile status appears as 'valid', you become
eligible for selection for an assignment. However, registration as an expert in the database
does not guarantee automatic selection. The EU services will select experts according to their
needs of expertise.
If you are selected, you will be contacted directly by the service concerned.
Selection of experts
Experts will be selected for assignments from the database of experts who registered in My
Expert Area.
The experts will be selected for each assignment on the basis of the specific expertise needed.
For each assignment (e.g. evaluation of a call or monitoring of projects), a 'pool' of experts
is drawn-up on the basis of the following criteria:
71EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Experts have a high level of skills, experience and knowledge in the relevant
area, including project management, innovation, exploitation, dissemination
and communication. Where relevant, inter-disciplinary experts, those with
expertise in appropriate disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, as well as
gender specialists are included in the 'pool'.
• If this condition is satisfied, the 'pool' should have a balanced composition in terms
of various skills, experience and knowledge, geographical diversity and
gender. With respect to gender, the policy of the EU is one of equal opportunities for
women and men and, in this context, we have a target of 40% of the under-represented
sex in evaluation panels and expert groups.
• A private-public sector balance is assured, if appropriate.
• Experts are regularly rotated by ensuring that individual experts do not work more
than 200 days activities within consecutive 4 calendar years (EUR 90 000 EUR). With
respect to evaluations in particular, for each call, at least 25% of experts included in the
'pool' should be newcomers, i.e. not have evaluated for the call in the previous 3 years.
The 'pool' of experts is drawn-up well in advance of the assignment in question and the final
list of experts selected from the initial 'pool' is made once the precise needs in terms of expertise
are known, e.g. in the case of an evaluation, after the call deadline once the proposals are
known. Consequently, extra experts are generally included in the 'pool' to ensure the expertise
required is covered and to foresee a sufficient reserve, should some no longer be in a position
to carry out the task.
7.2 Signing a contract and payment
Contracts
If you are selected as an expert, you will be offered a contract to be signed and managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. This contract (including its annexes) defines all the
rights, obligations, terms and conditions applicable to you. It is not an employment contract or
agreement.
Your contract will be based on the Model Contract for Experts. Some of the terms and conditions
in your contract will vary, depending on the type of expert activity that you are asked to carry
out. The contract will indicate
• whether or not your work will involve travel,
• the maximum number of days of work that you will be paid for and
• the planned calendar for your work.
Your correspondence with the EU services
All your correspondence with us is electronic. You should use only My Expert Area (Funding &
Tenders Portal) to communicate about your contract, e.g.
• submitting your identity/bank account details
• signing your contract (electronic-signature)
• making requests for payment and providing related supporting documents.
For any other correspondence related to your contract that the My Expert Area does not
currently support, use the email address indicated in Article 21.3 of your contract.
72EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Signing the contract
You must sign the contract online in My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal. You will
receive an email notification inviting you to do so, with a link to the contract.
The contract enters into force only once it has been signed by both parties. The contract must
be signed by both yourself and the EU service concerned by the day on which you start working
as an expert. Please do not forget to obtain permission from your employer to carry out your
expert activities if your employer requires this for outside activities – this is your responsibility.
You may start work as soon as the contract has entered into force.
If you have a contract to act as an evaluator or monitor, you will be granted access to the IT
system for the relevant proposals or project reports once the contract has entered into force.
Code of conduct
You need to adhere to the code of conduct in Annex 1 of the model contract, which includes
rules on the performance of the contract and obligations of impartiality and confidentiality.
Please carefully read Annex 1 before signing the contract.
Conflicts of interest
When contracting independent experts, the EU services ensure — to the best of their knowledge
- that you, as an expert, do not have any conflicts of interest on the activity that you are being
asked to undertake and, in particular, any proposal or project you are called upon to assess.
You should be independent, impartial and objective, and behave professionally at all times.
The contract you sign before starting work includes a declaration that you accept and will
abide by the Code of Conduct (Annex 1 of the contract). This means, amongst other things,
that
• you declare that no conflict of interest exists and
• you will inform the EU service concerned if you should discover that any such conflict
arises in the course of your duties.
• If, at the time that you sign the contract, you are already aware that you may be in a
position of conflict of interest, you are required to declare this.
Conflict of Interest impact?
To avoid situations of conflicts of interest, the EU services may withdraw experts from
evaluation or monitoring duties if it deems that this is necessary. You will be informed if this
happens to you and advised as to what to do if you need to take action.
• If you knowingly conceal a conflict of interest and this is discovered during your activities
as an expert, you will be dismissed with immediate effect, your contract will be
terminated and the measures laid down in the contract will be taken.
Example: Submitting proposals for funding while working as an expert
• If you submit a research proposal for evaluation, you are not necessarily excluded from
acting as an expert evaluator, provided that you declare it and that there is no conflict
of interest. In this case, you will not be assigned to evaluate your own proposal or any
proposals which may be competing with it.
We strongly advise you make sure that you have properly understood the provisions laid down
in the Code of Conduct, especially which situations are automatically considered to be a conflict
of interest.
Confidentiality
73EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If your role involves handling classified information, you will need security clearance before
entering into a contract.
The EU publishes an annual list of experts who have worked for us but we do not disclose who
has worked on which proposals.
Before assigning a project to you for monitoring activities, the EU services may inform the
project consortium of your name. The consortium may reject our choice of expert in the
interests of commercial confidentiality.
Payment
Requests for payment
Once your work is completed, you will receive an e-mail inviting you to submit your request
for payment through My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Travel expenses — When you claim your travel expenses, you should upload scanned copies of
all the original supporting documents as requested.
You must keep records and other supporting documents for at least two years after the payment
is made to show that you have complied in full with the terms of your contract.
Deadline — You should submit your request for payment within 30 days of receiving the email
invitation.
Bank account — You should request payment on one of the bank accounts which you have listed
in My Expert Area.
The EU services will make payments within 30 days of receiving the reports, deliverables or
completed payment requests (whichever comes latest) provided they are complete and
approved
Amount of the payment
The daily rate is EUR 450 for work including travel such as participating at evaluations,
monitoring activites or meetings at the commission or beneficiary premises. This is calculated
to the nearest half day (EUR 225) except in the following two cases:
• for remote work carried out by evaluators, any work that you are specifically asked to
carry out remotely will be paid in accordance with Article 4.1 of your contract.
• you are covered by one of the exceptional situations for which a zero fee contract must
be issued (e.g. for former EU staff in receipt of an allowance) or you requested that a
zero fee contract be issued
The contract sets out the maximum total number of days of work (and amount) that you can
be paid for. This is an upper ceiling. The actual amount that you will be paid is based on the
actual task assigned and worked; this may be less than the maximum amount.
• Please note that you will not receive payment for tasks that are not covered by the
contract (or an amendment to it) and which are not specifically assigned to you, either
via the relevant IT system, or in writing by us.
The reimbursement of travel expenses and payments of accommodation allowance and daily
allowance (see below) are made on request and in accordance with the Commission Rules on
the reimbursement of expenses of experts (see the annex of Commission Decision
C(2007)5858).
Travel expenses
74EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If your contract includes activities involving travel, expenses are refunded for this travel -
normally between the address indicated in the contract (the address registered in your expert
profile) and the meeting venue indicated in Article 3.2 of the contract. If you exceptionally need
to travel to or from a different location than the address in the contract, you need our explicit
agreement prior to purchasing your tickets.
You should book your travel as soon as possible to keep costs reasonable, but you should NOT
book your travel before your contract has been signed by both Parties.
Accommodation and daily allowances
We will also pay accommodation allowances and daily allowances:
• accommodation allowance is EUR 100 per night
• daily allowance is a flat rate of EUR 92 to cover all expenditure at the place where
the meeting/work is held, including meals and local transport (bus, tram, metro, taxi,
parking, motorway tolls, etc.) as well as travel and accident insurance
• experts who live less than 100km from the meeting venue receive a daily allowance
of EUR 46, and are not eligible to receive the accommodation allowance
• allowances may be increased for disabled experts, see below.
Other expenses
Expenses that you incur as a result of special instructions received in writing from the EU
services, different from the contract terms, may be reimbursed in justified cases on presentation
of supporting documents. Please note that no other expenses will be reimbursed.
Taxation issues
You are obliged to ensure compliance with your national legislation on taxes and social security
law – this is your responsibility. Payments you receive are NOT exempted from national taxes.
However, if you are considered to supply a taxable service under national tax law and you are
registered for VAT as a natural person in an EU Member State, you can benefit from a VAT
exemption certificate for EU payments made under your contract.
Please note that in this case your invoice needs to bear a special indication “VAT exemption
/ European Union / Article 151 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC” (specific incidations are
mandatory for some countries, like Belgium, Luxembourg or Italy).
Further information on the VAT situation can be found in the FAQs on the Funding & Tenders
Portal.
Disabilities
If an expert's disability requires that a person accompany them when travelling, then the
travel expenses of that person will also be refunded upon prior request. The EU services will
also pay accommodation allowances and daily allowances to the accompanying person.
Keeping supporting documents:
You must keep records or other supporting documents for two years from the date of the
last payment made under the contract that the work relates to, when you work as an expert.
The EU services may ask you to provide these documents as evidence that the contract was
carried out correctly and that any expenses claimed are genuine.
75EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
7.3 Experts roles and tasks
If you have registered as an expert and have the required profile, the EU service will contact
you in due course to let you know whether you have been selected. This depends on whether
there are any proposals to be evaluated or projects to be monitored requiring your
particular expertise.
Roles and tasks assigned to experts
As an expert, you can perform a variety of roles and tasks:
1. Evaluators are responsible for evaluating proposals submitted in response to a call for
proposals.
Evaluators may also act as a rapporteur, chair, or vice-chair at consensus discussions
or meetings of panels of evaluators. Rapporteurs are responsible for drafting the
consensus report (CR) of a consensus meeting.
2. Observers provide the EU services with independent advice on the conduct and fairness
of all phases of the evaluation process, on how evaluators apply award criteria, and on
how to improve the procedure.
The observer may attend any meeting held during the proposal evaluation process and
drafts a report on the evaluation session observed.
3. Monitors assist EU services in monitoring the implementation of projects that have
received funding, taking into account work descriptions, reports and deliverables.
All experts' tasks are laid down in their contract and its annexes. See the Model Contract for
Experts for further details.
Proposal-evaluation process
The underlying principles to bear in mind during evaluation are:
• Excellence - projects must demonstrate a high level of quality in relation to the topics
and criteria set out in the calls
• Transparency - funding decisions must be based on clearly defined rules and
procedures, and applicants should receive adequate feedback on the outcome of the
evaluation
• Fairness and impartiality - all proposals must be treated equally and evaluated
impartially on their merits, irrespective of their origin or the identity of the applicants
• Confidentiality - all proposals and related data, knowledge and documents must be
treated in confidence
• Speed and efficiency - proposals should be evaluated and grants awarded and
administered as swiftly as possible, without compromising quality or breaking the rules
Award criteria
The award criteria to be applied by the evaluators are set for each programme in the call
conditions .
Thresholds may vary according to the work programme. For two-stage submission schemes,
thresholds and the maximum overall score may vary between the first and the second stage.
76EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Steps in the Process
The diagram below depicts the main steps of the evaluation process and highlights at which
stages the experts intervene
There are three main phases in the experts' involvement in the evaluation process.
Before starting their work, experts are briefed on evaluation procedures (including remote
evaluation), the topics of the relevant calls for proposals and the terms of their contracts. This
briefing can be done in Brussels or remotely (e.g. web-streaming).
For each proposal, experts presents their evaluation results in an individual evaluation
report (IER), explaining the evaluation scores. Expert evaluators also pre-screen each
proposal (on the basis of the applicant's ethics self-assessment) to see if it raises ethical
issues. All evaluation forms are completed online. This report can be completed and
signed remotely or in Brussels.
In principle, proposals will be evaluated initially by at least three experts (in a number of
cases, five or more). However, for the first stage in two-stage submission schemes and
for low-value grants, only two experts may be involved.
A consensus group is convened in order for all the experts who assessed the proposals
in question to discuss the individual evaluation reports and agree on comments and
scores.
The consensus group discussion is led by a moderator (normally an official from the
concerned EU service), who seeks a consensus and ensures that proposals are evaluated
in a fair manner and in line with the established criteria.
The consensus group discussion results in a consensus report (CR) including
justifications of scores and dissenting views, if any. The moderator is responsible for
ensuring that the consensus report reflects the consensus reached. The report is signed
by the rapporteur and the experts evaluating the proposal discussed.
The discussion usually takes place in Brussels and includes experts who participated in
the individual evaluation. It is also possible to convene a remote consensus group.
Panel review consists of reviewing all the proposals within a call, or part of a call, to:
• ensure that the consensus groups have been consistent in their evaluations;
77EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• if necessary, propose a new set of marks or comments; and
• resolve cases where a consensus could not be reached and a minority view was
recorded in the consensus report.
Exceptionally, in some cases, justified by the specific call circumstances, the outcome of
the consensus group will constitute the final result of the evaluation, and there will be no
panel review. These cases will be signalled in the guidance documents.
The panel review is led by a panel chairperson (normally an official from the concerned
EU service) who ensures fair and equal treatment of the proposals.
The panel review should result in a panel report which includes the evaluation
summary report (ESR) for each proposal, a list of proposals passing all thresholds,
along with a final score, (panel ranked list) and, where necessary, the panel's
recommendations for priority order in the event of equal scores, using the procedure set
out in the work programme. A rapporteur may be appointed to draft the panel report.
Monitoring projects (Technical review)
Projects are monitored to assess the work carried out over a given period and make
recommendations to the EU services. Monitoring may cover scientific, technological and other
aspects of the implementation of the project and Grant Agreement.
The monitoring expert's task is to advise the EU services on how the project has progressed
with regard to:
• the initial work plan
• deliverables
• planned and used resources
• relevance of the objectives
• scientific and industrial quality
• management procedures and methods
• Beneficiaries' contributions, and
• the expected potential impact in scientific, technological, economic, competitive and
social terms, and the plans for the use and dissemination of results.
Depending on the project's complexity and progress, the review may include remote work
entailing reading and analysis of the Grant Agreement, grant decision and other background
information and deliverables and finally drafting the report. The expert may also be required to
attend project meetings at the EU services offices or at the premises of the Beneficiary.
The EU services may require the expert to carry out on-site technical audits to verify whether
critical milestones are being met, or to assist in carrying out research integrity (scientific
misconduct) analysis during implementation.
Types of project monitoring
• Periodic monitoring provided for in the Grant Agreement (generally linked to payment)
• Ad-hoc monitoring, which the EU services can request at any time, where necessary,
and which may involve reviewing financial and technical aspects, or only technical
aspects.
78EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Monitoring process
• Review meeting and assessment - experts read all relevant documents before and
attends the review meeting. They then assess the project on the basis of the written
material and information provided at the meeting. In the event of remote monitoring,
the assessment is based on written documents only.
• Monitoring report - the expert draws up the monitoring report on a project, and the
EU service sends it to the consortium via the Coordinator, but it is not made public. If
more than one expert is involved in project monitoring, they issue a single consolidated
report written by a rapporteur.
• Recommendations - the monitor will also assist the EU services by recommending any
changes that may be required. However, the final decision on recommendations and
changes is taken by the EU services alone.
• Observations - Beneficiaries may comment on the monitoring report within one month
of receiving it.
• Project assessment by the EU services? - taking the experts' formal
recommendations into account, the EU services informs the Coordinator of its decision,
which, however, may depart from the recommendations. It may entail
accepting or rejecting the deliverables
o
allowing the project to continue in its existing form
o
suggesting modifications, or
o
taking steps to terminate the Grant Agreement or to exclude a Beneficiary from
o
taking part.

Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training1
Research Excellence
Striving for excellent research is fundamental to all doctoral education and from this all other
elements flow. Academic standards set via peer review procedures and research environments
representing a critical mass are required. The new academic generation should be trained to
become creative, critical and autonomous intellectual risk takers, pushing the boundaries of
frontier research.
Attractive Institutional Environment
Doctoral candidates should find good working conditions to empower them to become
independent researchers taking responsibility at an early stage for the scope, direction and
progress of their project. These should include career development opportunities, in line with
the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of
Researchers.2
Interdisciplinary Research Options
Doctoral training must be embedded in an open research environment and culture to ensure
that any appropriate opportunities for cross-fertilisation between disciplines can foster the
necessary breadth and interdisciplinary approach.
Exposure to industry and other relevant employment sectors
The term 'industry' is used in the widest sense, including all fields of future workplaces and
public engagement, from industry to business, government, NGO’s, charities and cultural
institutions (e.g. musea). This can include placements during research training; shared
funding; involvement of non-academics from relevant industry in informing/delivering
teaching and supervision; promoting financial contribution of the relevant industry to doctoral
programmes; fostering alumni networks that can support the candidate (for example
mentoring schemes) and the programme, and a wide array of people/technology/knowledge
transfer activities.3
1 Extract from "Report of Mapping Exercise on Doctoral Training in Europe "Towards a common approach" of
27 June 2011(final), adopted by the ERA Steering Group on Human Resources and Mobility. The Principles
were defined with the help of experts from university associations; industry and funding organisations.They
reflect the Salzburg Principles of EUA, good practice in Member States and the Marie Curie experience. The
Principles have been endorsed in the Council conclusions on the modernisation of higher education, Brussels,
28 and 29 November 2011.

3 http://www.eua.be/eua-work-and-policy-area/research-and-innovation/doctoral-education/doc-careersInternational networking
Doctoral training should provide opportunities for international networking, i.e. through
collaborative research, co-tutelle, dual and joint degrees. Mobility should be encouraged, be it
through conferences, short research visits and secondments or longer stays abroad.
Transferable skills training
“Transferable skills are skills learned in one context (for example research) that are useful in
another (for example future employment whether that is in research, business etc). They
enable subject- and research-related skills to be applied and developed effectively.
Transferable skills may be acquired through training or through work experience”.4 It is
essential to ensure that enough researchers have the skills demanded by the knowledge based
economy. Examples include communication, teamwork, entrepreneurship, project
management, IPR, ethics, standardisation etc.
Business should also be more involved in curricula development and doctoral training so that
skills better match industry needs, building on the work of the University Business Forum5
and the outcomes of the EUA DOC-CAREERS project.6 There are good examples of inter-
disciplinary approaches in universities bringing together skills ranging from research to
financial and business skills and from creativity and design to intercultural skills.
Quality Assurance
The accountability procedures must be established on the research base of doctoral education
and for that reason, they should be developed separately from the quality assurance in the first
and second cycle. The goal of quality assurance in doctoral education should be to enhance
the quality of the research environment as well as promoting transparent and accountable
procedures for topics such as admission, supervision, awarding the doctorate degree and
career development. It is important to stress that this is not about the quality assurance of the
PhD itself rather the process or life cycle, from recruitment to graduation.
The common approach should provide a framework of reference, whilst preserving flexibility
and autonomy for institutions and doctoral candidates.

Critical risk A critical risk is a plausible event or issue that could have a high adverse impact
on the ability of the project to achieve its objectives. Level of likelihood to occur
(Low/medium/high): The likelihood is the estimated probability that the risk will
materialise even after taking account of the mitigating measures put in place.
Level of severity (Low/medium/high): The relative seriousness of the risk and
the significance of its effect.
Deliverable A report that is sent to the Commission or Agency providing information to
ensure effective monitoring of the project. There are different types of
deliverables (e.g. a report on specific activities or results, data management
plans, ethics or security requirements).
Impacts Wider long term effects on society (including the environment), the economy
and science, enabled by the outcomes of R&I investments (long term). It refers
to the specific contribution of the project to the work programme expected
impacts described in the destination. Impacts generally occur some time after
the end of the project. Example: The deployment of the advanced forecasting
system enables each airport to increase maximum passenger capacity by 15%
and passenger average throughput by 10%, leading to a 28% reduction in
infrastructure expansion costs.
Milestone Control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may
correspond to the achievement of a key result, allowing the next phase of the
work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if
problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a
critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must
decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development. The
achievement of a milestone should be verifiable.
Objectives The goals of the work performed within the project, in terms of its research and
innovation content. This will be translated into the project’s activities. These
may range from tackling specific research questions, demonstrating the
feasibility of an innovation, sharing knowledge among stakeholders on specific
issues. The nature of the objectives will depend on the type of action, and the
scope of the topic.
Outcomes The expected effects, over the medium term, of projects supported under a
given topic. The results of a project should contribute to these outcomes,
fostered in particular by the dissemination and exploitation measures (including
the uptake, diffusion, deployment, and/or use of the project’s results by direct
target groups). Outcomes generally occur during or shortly after the end of the
project. Example: 9 European airports adopt the advanced forecasting system
demonstrated during the project.
Pathway to Logical steps towards the achievement of the expected impacts of the project
impact over time, in particular beyond the duration of a project. A pathway begins with
the projects’ results, to their dissemination, exploitation and communication,
contributing to the expected outcomes in the work programme topic, and
ultimately to the wider scientific, economic and societal impacts of the work
programme destination.
Research Results generated by the action to which access can be given in the form of
7EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
output scientific publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such
as software, algorithms, protocols and electronic notebooks.
Results What is generated during the project implementation. This may include, for
example, know-how, innovative solutions, algorithms, proof of feasibility, new
business models, policy recommendations, guidelines, prototypes,
demonstrators, databases and datasets, trained researchers, new
infrastructures, networks, etc. Most project results (inventions, scientific works,
etc) are ‘Intellectual Property’, which may, if appropriate, be protected by
formal ‘Intellectual Property Rights’. Example: Successful large-scale
demonstrator: trial with 3 airports of an advanced forecasting system for
proactive airport passenger flow management.
Horizon Europe is divided into three pillars and one part, corresponding to its main
priorities
• The Excellent Science pillar aims to increase the EU’s global scientific
competitiveness. It supports frontier research projects defined and driven by top
researchers themselves through the European Research Council, funds
fellowships for postdoctoral researchers, doctoral training networks and
exchanges for researchers through Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, and invests
in world-class research infrastructures.
• The Global Challenges and European Industrial Competiveness pillar supports
research relating to societal challenges and reinforces technological and
industrial capacities through clusters. It sets EU-missions with ambitious goals
tackling some of our biggest problems. It also includes activities pursued by the
Joint Research Centre which supports EU and national policymakers with
independent scientific evidence and technical support.
• The Innovative Europe pillar aims to make Europe a frontrunner in market-
creating innovation via the European Innovation Council. It also helps to develop
8EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
the overall European innovation landscape through the European Institute of
Innovation and Technology (EIT) which fosters the integration of the knowledge
triangle of education, research and innovation.
• The part Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area
(ERA) increase support to EU Member States in their efforts to make the most of
their national research and innovation potential.
Finally, Horizon Europe will be implemented also through the European Defence Fund
and complemented by the Euratom Research and Training Programme.
Horizon Europe will have a budget of around €95.5 billion for 2021-2027 (current
prices). This includes €5.4 billion (current prices) from NextGenerationEU to boost
recovery and make the EU more resilient for the future, as well as an additional
reinforcement (i.e. in addition to the MFF agreement in July 2020) of €4.6 billion
(current prices).
The Horizon Europe strategic plan sets out overarching strategic orientations for EU
research and innovation investments over the period 2021-2024. Focusing on the
second pillar of Horizon Europe, 'Global challenges and European industrial
competitiveness', it also covers relevant activities in the first pillar, ‘Excellent Science’,
and the third pillar, ‘Innovative Europe’, and the ‘Widening Participation and
Strengthening the European Research Area’ part.
Overall, the aim of the strategic plan is to ensure an effective interface between EU
policy priorities, and programme activities and ultimately, the research and innovation
projects funded by Horizon Europe. The intention is to stimulate research and
innovation investments where they are particularly needed to address the challenges
we are facing, and, most importantly, deliver results.
The Horizon Europe strategic plan defines four key strategic orientations:
• Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of
key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value
chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-
centred technologies and innovations.
• Restoring Europe’s ecosystems and biodiversity, and managing
sustainably natural resources to ensure food security and a clean and healthy
environment.
• Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and
sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy,
construction and production systems.
• Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society,
prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and
providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the
green and digital transitions.
Each of the key strategic orientations encompasses three to four cross-cutting impact
areas, which in turn link to a number of expected impacts. The key strategic
orientations and impact areas are formulated on the basis of the expected impacts,
which have been defined with input from stakeholders, largely bottom-up, during the
strategic planning process. The expected impacts are structured by the six clusters
that make up Horizon Europe’s second Pillar, ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial
9EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Competitiveness’. The expected impacts define the wider effects on society, the
economy and science to be targeted by research and innovation activities, but not the
manner in which to achieve them. This is up to the applicants when designing their
project proposals. In total, the strategic plan defines 32 expected impacts that cover a
wide range of social, economic, ecological and scientific aspirations. Each expected
impact serves as the foundation for a corresponding destination in the relevant work
programme parts.
Furthermore, the strategic plan identifies European co-programmed and co-funded
partnerships, as well as the EU missions and contains orientations regarding cross-
cutting elements of Horizon Europe related to areas for international cooperation,
and key specific issues, such as gender, social sciences and humanities
integration, key enabling technologies, ethics, open science practices, as well
as social innovation and the EU taxonomy.
The Horizon Europe strategic plan is the product of a series of intense co-creation
activities among Commission services and co-design activities with Member States,
members of the European Parliament, stakeholders and citizens at large. This has taken
place through successive rounds of public consultations, web surveys and interactive
workshops, in particular during the annual Research and Innovation Days.
The impact-driven design of Horizon Europe1 aims at maximising the effects of Research
and Innovation investments, ensuring their contribution to the Commission’s policy
priorities.
It marks a paradigm change in the design of the EU R&I Framework Programmes from
an activity-driven to an impact-driven programme.
One of the novelties in the implementation of the Horizon Europe programme which
facilitates such an impact-driven approach is the strategic planning process (as
described above), which identifies the expected impacts of the first four years of
Horizon Europe.
This represents a paradigm change also for the work programmes, that henceforth
builds on this strategic planning. The structure of Horizon Europe work programmes
translates this impact-driven nature: they are organised around ‘Destinations’,
describing the expected impacts identified in the Strategic Planning, and ‘topics’,
describing the related expected outcomes critical to the achievement of such impacts.
This impact design is also translated at project level, with revamped proposal and
reporting templates, allowing for a straightforward monitoring that aims at providing
close-to-real-time information.
Horizon Europe ground breaking approach to monitoring, the Key Impact Pathways2,
aims at capturing and communicating impact around 9 key story lines during and after
the programme implementation. Its objective is to allow policy makers and the wider
public to get regular insights regarding the effects and benefits of the programme on
European science, the economy and wider society3.

European Partnerships bring the Commission and private and/or public partners
together to address some of Europe’s most pressing challenges through concerted
research and innovation initiatives. They are a key implementation tool of Horizon
Europe, and contribute significantly to achieving the EU’s political priorities.
By bringing private and public partners together, European Partnerships help to avoid
the duplication of investments and contribute to reducing the fragmentation of the
research and innovation landscape in the EU.
Find out more about European Partnerships: European Partnerships in Horizon Europe -
European Commission (europa.eu).
The aim of European partnerships with EU and associated countries, the private sector,
foundations and other stakeholders is to deliver on global challenges and modernise
industry.
The Horizon Europe proposal lays down the conditions and principles for establishing
European Partnerships. There are 3 types:
• European Co-programme Partnerships
These are partnerships between the Commission and private and/or public
partners. They are based on memoranda of understanding.
• European Co-funded Partnerships
Partnerships involving EU countries, with research funders and other public
authorities at the core of the consortium.
• European Institutionalised Partnerships
These are partnerships in the field of research and innovation between the
Union, EU member states and/or industry. These partnerships require legislative
proposals from the Commission and are based on a Council Regulation (on the
basis of Article 187 TFEU) or a Decision by the European Parliament and Council
(on the basis of Article 185 TFEU). They are implemented by dedicated
structures created for that purpose. Institutionalised partnerships will only be
implemented where other parts of the Horizon Europe programme, including
other types of partnership, would not achieve the desired objectives or expected
impacts. EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) are also
institutionalised partnerships. EIT KICs aim to address skills shortages and are
already established under Horizon 2020. Key partners in EIT KICs are higher
education institutions, research organisations, companies and other
stakeholders.

EU missions are commitments to solve some of the greatest challenges facing our
world like fighting cancer, adapting to climate change, protecting our oceans, living in
11EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
greener cities and ensuring soil health and food. They are an integral part of Horizon
Europe.
Each mission will operate as a portfolio of actions – such as research projects, policy
measures or even legislative initiatives - to achieve a measurable goal that could not be
achieved through individual actions. EU missions will contribute to the goals of the
European Green Deal, Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan as well as the Sustainable
Development Goals. A wide range of studies and reports informed this approach
(Mission-oriented policy studies and reports - European Commission (europa.eu)).
EU missions will:
• be bold, inspirational and widely relevant to society
• be clearly framed: targeted, measurable and time-bound
• establish impact-driven but realistic goals
• mobilise resources on EU, national and local levels
• link activities across different disciplines and different types of research and
innovation
• make it easier for citizens to understand the value of investments in research
and innovation
Areas where there will be missions:
• Cancer
• Adaptation to climate change including societal transformation
• Healthy oceans, seas coastal and inland waters
• Climate-neutral and smart cities
• Soil health and food

In the context of Horizon Europe, international cooperation is about cooperation with
legal entities established in non-EU countries (third countries). A non-EU country is any
country or territory that is neither an EU Member State nor an overseas country or
territory linked to an EU Member State. Non-EU countries are either associated or not
associated to the Horizon Europe programme.
Overseas countries and territories (OCTs) linked to Member States
Legal entities from OCTs can participate and receive funding under equivalent
conditions as legal entities from Member States.
The OCTs (and their linked Member States) are:
Aruba (NL), Bonaire (NL), Curação (NL), French Polynesia (FR), French Southern
and Antarctic Territories (FR), Greenland (DK), New Caledonia (FR), Saba (NL),
12EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Saint Barthélemy (FR), Sint Eustatius (NL), Sint Maarten (NL), St. Pierre and
Miquelon (FR), Wallis and Futuna Islands (FR).
Third countries associated to Horizon Europe
Association to Horizon Europe is governed by the Horizon Europe Regulation 2021/6954.
Legal entities from associated countries can participate under equivalent conditions as
legal entities from the EU Member States, unless specific limitations or conditions are
laid down in the work programme and/or call/topic text. Such measures could include
the limitation of participation in certain actions to legal entities established in the EU
alone, or in the EU and specified non-EU countries, in order to safeguard the EU’s
strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security. Limitations or conditions may also be
attached to the participation of legal entities established in an eligible country but which
are controlled directly or indirectly by an ineligible country5. The eligibility will be clearly
defined in the work programme. There could also be criteria on the place of
establishment of the legal entity to take into account specific policy requirements or the
nature and objectives of the action6.
Association to Horizon Europe takes place through the conclusion of an international
agreement between the EU and the non-EU country. All sixteen third countries
associated to the previous programme, Horizon 2020, have also expressed interest to
become associated to Horizon Europe. Other third countries have also expressed an
interest in association.
Please see the List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe for an up-to-date list of
countries with which the association agreements have started to produce legal effects
(either through provisional application or their entry into force).
Until association agreements start producing legal effects either through provisional
application or their entry into force, transitional arrangement may apply if provided for
in the particular Horizon Europe work programme. The transitional arrangements apply
with regard to the countries and legal entities established in these countries, with which
association negotiations are being processed or where association is imminent (see List
of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe).
The list is regularly updated to reflect the status of the negotiations for association.
Third countries associated to Euratom Research and Training Programme
For the Euratom Research and Training Programme,similar rules concerning the
transitional arrangement apply. The list of participating countries contains a separate
list with the participating countries to the Euratom Research and Training Programme.
Other third countries
Most Horizon Europe calls are also open to participants from non-associated countries
and international organisations, unless specific limitations or conditions are laid down in
the work programme and/or the call/topic text, such as those described for associated
countries above.
Moreover, some Horizon Europe calls are particularly relevant for international
cooperation, encouraging or even requiring the participation of entities from non-
4 Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing
Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for
participation and dissemination, and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1290/2013 and (EU) No 1291/2013
(OJ 12.5.2021 L 170/1).

associated non-EU countries in the funded actions. Such calls and topics can be found
by using the filter ‘Quick search on specific priorities’ on the Funding & Tenders Portal
search page (e.g. Africa, Mediterranean).
Participants from non-associated non-EU countries can take part in Horizon Europe
actions — but not always with funding.
For the up-to-date list of low to middle income countries in which entities have to be
established to be automatically eligible for funding, please see the List of
Participating Countries in Horizon Europe.
Participants from other countries (i.e. countries that are neither EU Member States, nor
countries associated to Horizon Europe, nor countries listed above) are not
automatically eligible for funding and therefore by default have to participate at their
own cost. These participants should explain in the proposal how their funding will be
secured.
They can however receive exceptional funding, if:
• their country is explicitly identified in the Horizon Europe work programme and
call for proposals as being eligible for funding
• the granting authority considers that their participation as a beneficiary is
essential for implementing the project, for example in view of their:
o outstanding competence/expertise
o access to particular research infrastructures
o access to particular geographical environments
o access to particular data.
In addition, a number of non-EU/non-associated countries that are not automatically
eligible for funding have made specific provisions for national financing mechanisms for
their participants in Horizon Europe projects. For more information, see Horizon Europe
Complementary funding mechanisms in third countries.
Innovation Actions —In accordance with the 2019 “EU-China - A Strategic outlook”
communication, the 2021 “Global Approach to Research and Innovation”
communication, and the joint conclusions of the 4th EU-China Innovation Cooperation
Dialogue of 2019, an exercise to develop a Joint Roadmap for the future of EU-China
cooperation in science, technology, and innovation (Roadmap) has been established
between the EU and China. It has the objective to develop a level playing field for
engagement between the EU and China in the areas of science, technology, and
innovation (STI) that is respectful of fundamental research and innovation values and
principles. This endeavor is to be achieved through an agreement on the framework
conditions contained in the Roadmap and their monitoring and evaluation. As progress
so far has mainly taken place on the framework conditions linked to research rather
than on those related to innovation, and taking into account the nature and objectives
in particular of Innovation Actions, cooperation with entities established in China needs
to be calibrated accordingly.
Legal entities established in China are therefore not eligible to participate in Horizon
Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries,
affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions,
subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may
be granted on a caseby-case basis for justified reasons. The above eligibility condition
may be reviewed in the future in accordance with policy developments. This exclusion is
justified under Article 22(6) of the Horizon Europe Regulation given the substantive
14EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
concerns regarding the use of intellectual property generated under this publicly funded
programme, and the ongoing discussions between China and the EU on the Joint
Roadmap for the future of EU-China cooperation in science, technology, and innovation.
Restrictions on participation or control — For actions related to EU strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security, the specific topic conditions may limit participation to
legal entities established only in EU Member States or in EU Member States and specific
associated or non-associated third countries. In addition, for duly justified and
exceptional reasons, to guarantee protection of the strategic interests of the EU and its
Member States, the specific call conditions may also exclude the participation of legal
entities directly or indirectly controlled by non-eligible third countries or by legal entities
of non-eligible third countries (or make their participation subject to specific
conditions), in line with Article 22(5) of the Horizon Europe Regulation. In this case, the
eligible countries will be identified in the specific call conditions.
EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article
29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU (TFEU)7 as well as Article 75 TFEU8, are not eligible to participate
in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third
parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to
third parties (if any).
Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled
territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the
involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the
implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established
in Russia, Belarus, or in nongovernment controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore,
even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities
are not eligible to participate in any capacity9. This includes participation as
beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind
contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
International organisations
International European research organisations are automatically eligible to receive
funding from Horizon Europe. International European research organisations are defined
as international organisations, the majority of whose members are EU Member States
or associated countries, and whose principal objective is to promote scientific and
technological cooperation in Europe.
For what concerns participation in Horizon Europe actions, international European
research organisations are deemed to be established in a Member State other than the
ones in which the other legal entities participating in the action are established.
As regards all other international organisations:
• For European Research Council frontier research actions, training and mobility
actions and when provided for in the work programme, international
organisations with headquarters in a Member State or associated country are

9 However, natural persons established in Russia, Belarus or in non-government controlled territories of
Ukraine may participate in Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions provided that they are not subject to EU
restrictive measures and comply with all other relevant conditions, including the specific eligibility and
other conditions set out in part 2 of the work programme.
15EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
deemed to be established in that Member State or associated country, and thus
automatically eligible for funding from Horizon Europe.
• In all other cases, international organisations are not automatically eligible for
funding from Horizon Europe, and they may exceptionally receive funding only
if:
o they are identified in the relevant Horizon Europe work programme as
being eligible for funding or
o the granting authority considers that their participation is deemed
essential for implementing the action, for example in view of their:
▪ outstanding competence/expertise
▪ access to particular research infrastructures
▪ access to particular geographical environments
▪ access to particular data.
Foreign interference in Research & Innovation
The Commission has published a toolkit for tackling R&I foreign interference. This
document provides a number of recommendations relating to values, governance,
partnerships, and cybersecurity, which are designed to provide support to higher
education institutions and research performing organisations in their international R&I
engagement. All participants in Horizon Europe are recommended to familiarise
themselves with the document, and any equivalent advice that exists at national level,
and to consider their relevance for the proposals they intend to submit.
Horizon Europe sets gender equality as a cross-cutting principle and aims to
eliminate gender inequality and intersecting socio-economic inequalities
throughout research and innovation systems, including by addressing unconscious bias
and systemic structural barriers.
The strengthened provisions for gender equality under Horizon Europe address three
different levels and include the following:
• A new eligibility criterion to get access to Horizon Europe funding: public
bodies, research organisations and higher education establishments from
Member States and associated countries are required, as of calls with deadlines
in 2022, to have in place a gender equality plan (GEP). Details on this
requirement are specified in General Annex B — Eligibility and additional
guidance is available through this webpage, including a link to Frequently Asked
Questions accessible through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
• The integration of the gender dimension into research and innovation
content across the Programme is an operational objective for Horizon Europe,
and becomes a requirement by default.
• Particular attention is being paid to ensuring gender balance, with a target of
50% women in Horizon Europe related advisory bodies such as boards and
expert groups, as well as in evaluation panels. Gender balance among
researchers involved in projects is strongly encouraged as well, and will be
taken into account as a ranking criterion for ex aequo proposals.
16EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Researchers have the possibility to self-identify in proposals and project
reporting according to three gender categories: woman, man, or non-binary.
In addition:
• Specific funding will be made available for actions supporting the development of
inclusive gender equality plans in research and innovation organisations across
Member States and associated countries, under the Widening Participation
and Strengthening the European Research Area Programme Part.
• Specific funding will also be allocated to gender studies and intersectional
research, in particular under Pillar II, Cluster 2 - Culture, Creativity and
Inclusive Society.
• Flagship measures and activities for promoting gender equality are introduced
under Pillar III, in particular through the European Innovation Council (EIC),
including a target of 40% women-led companies invited to pitch their projects in
the Accelerator instrument, a target of 50% women among members of EIC
advisory structures, a dedicated initiative to support women-led deep-tech start-
ups, and the continuation of the EU prize for women innovators.
These strenghtened provisions are also detailed on the Commission’s Gender equality in
research and innovation policy webpage, and summarised in the factsheet Gender
equality: a strengthened commitment in Horizon Europe. A detailed Guidance
document has been developed to support organisations to meet the Horizon Europe GEP
eligibility criterion. Additionally, a dedicated webinar with a focus on GEPs in available
online to help participants comply with the eligibility criterion.
In this Programme Guide, we focus more specifically on the integration of the gender
dimension into research and innovation (R&I) content, and refer the reader to the links
provided above and to the following webinar for further guidance on the other gender
equality aspects addressed in Horizon Europe and to be taken into account by
applicants.
Integration of the gender dimension into R&I content: a requirement under
Horizon Europe
The integration of the gender dimension into R&I content is mandatory. It is a
requirement set by default across all work programmes, destinations and topics, unless
its non-relevance for a specific topic is specified in the topic description, e.g. by the
mention “In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender
analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement”.
This new requirement to integrate the gender dimension by default in R&I content in
projects is recalled in the General Introduction to the Horizon Europe Work Programme,
and in the General Annex D — Award Criteria (for Research and innovation actions,
Innovation actions and Programme co-fund actions) and it is thus reflected in the
corresponding application forms (proposal template) for Research and Innovation
Actions, Innovation Actions and Programme Co-fund Actions under the Excellence
evaluation criterion (under Methodology).
In the proposal template, applicants are invited to describe how the gender dimension
(i.e. sex and/or gender analysis) is taken into account in the project’s R&I content. If
applicants do not consider such a gender dimension to be relevant in their specific
project, they should provide a sound justification, which will be taken into account
during evaluation of the proposal, e.g. with appropriate scientific references.
What does integrating the gender dimension in R&I content mean?
17EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
It is an umbrella term covering the integration of sex and/or gender analysis through
the entire R&I cycle, from the setting of research priorities through defining concepts,
formulating research questions, developing methodologies, gathering and analysing
sex/gender disaggregated data, to evaluating and reporting results and transferring
them to markets into products and innovations which will benefit all citizens and
promote gender equality. Addressing the gender dimension in research and
innovation thus entails taking into account sex and gender in the whole R&I
process. It is different from addressing issues of gender balance and equal
opportunities among the project’s team members or among participants to events (e.g.
conferences) organised by the project.
Definitions of key related terms:
• Sex refers to biology. Sex is determined by several biological features, according to
functions that derive from the chromosomal complement, reproductive organs, or
specific hormones or environmental factors that affect the expression of phenotypic
traits (morphology) in sexually reproducing organisms. In humans, sex refers to the
biological attributes that distinguish male, female, or intersex. In non-human
animals, sex refers to biological attributes that distinguish male, female, or
hermaphrodite. In engineering & product design research, sex includes anatomical
and physiological characteristics that may impact the design of products, systems,
and processes. Sex differences may be relevant for many R&I projects.
• Gender refers to sociocultural norms, identities and relations that categorise people,
structure societies and organisations, and shape behaviours, products, technologies,
environments, and knowledge. Gender attitudes and behaviours are complex and
change across time and place, as cultural norms and values change. How we speak,
our mannerisms, the things we use and our behaviours all signal who we are and
establish rules for interaction. Gender is an organising principle that structures
behaviours, attitudes, physical appearance and habits. We generally consider three
related dimensions of gender: gender norms (socio-cultural expectations of what is
appropriate for women, men or gender-diverse individuals, often relying on gender
stereotypes), gender identities (how individuals or groups perceive and present
themselves in relation to gender norms, with most commonly used categories
including: woman, man, and non-binary or gender-diverse) and gender relations
(how sex and gender shape social interactions in families, schools, workplaces and
public settings, often involving power relations). As such, gender can be an
important aspect of research and design.
• Intersectionality describes overlapping or intersecting categories such as gender,
ethnicity/racial origin, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation and geographic
location, that compound to determine the identities and experiences of individuals.
Researchers and innovators should not consider gender in isolation. Gender
identities, norms and relations both shape and are shaped by other social attributes.
Why is the gender dimension important?
An increasing body of studies shows that the quality, reproducibility and accountability
of research and innovation are affected by not taking into account sex and gender
analysis. And in many fields, it is crucial to explore whether research outcomes may
affect women and men differently. For instance:
• Why do we observe differences between women and men in infection levels and
mortality rates in the COVID-19 pandemic? Does it make sense to study
cardiovascular diseases only on male animals and on men, or osteoporosis only
on women? And did you know that pheromones given off by men experimenters,
but not women, induce a stress response in laboratory mice sufficient to trigger
pain relief?
18EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Did you know that many aspects of taxation have a substantial effect on gender-
related socioeconomic inequalities, but that when designing tax laws,
policymakers still rarely consider gender inequalities?
• Does it make sense to design car safety equipment only on the basis of male
body standards?
• Did you know that almost 3/4 of women Internet users worldwide have
experienced some form of cyberviolence?
• Why do household travel surveys, and thus mobility analysis and transport
planning, underrate trips performed as part of caring work, which are
predominantly undertaken by women?
• Is it ethical to develop AI products that could spread gender and racial biases
due to a lack of diversity in the data used in training AI applications?
• Did you know that climate change is affecting sex determination in a number of
marine species and that certain populations are now at risk of extinction?
Integrating sex and gender analysis into R&I content improves the scientific quality
and societal relevance of the produced knowledge, technologies and
innovation. It:
• adds value to research and innovation in terms of excellence, creativity, rigor,
reproducibility and business opportunities
• helps researchers and innovators question gender norms and stereotypes, and
rethink standards and reference models
• leads to an in-depth understanding of all people’s needs, behaviours, and
attitudes
• contributes to the production of goods and services better suited to new markets
• is crucial to secure Europe’s leadership in science & technology and support
inclusive and sustainable growth.
Therefore, when drafting a proposal, you should in particular:
• Reflect on why sex and/or gender could matter: Think about and present
the ways in which taking into account the gender dimension will provide added
value in terms of creativity, excellence, and return on investment, both from
public and private perspectives.
• Consider the production of new knowledge on gender: Consider what is
already known in your area in terms of the gender dimension (e.g. related
scientific literature) and identify what is missing. In many areas, gender
knowledge still needs to be generated.
• Include sex and gender aspects as part of a multidisciplinary approach:
Reflecting on sex and gender considerations in relation to health, transport,
energy, security, etc. is a great opportunity to foster cooperation between
scientists with gender expertise and others. It helps concepts cross the borders
of scientific fields and encourages research methods to evolve.
• Consider social categories/factors intersecting with sex and gender: the
way a research problem is formulated will determine which intersecting variables
are relevant for analysis. Intersectional research should be designed to
19EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
illuminate the multiplicative effects of different, but interdependent, categories
and factors.
Guidance and concrete examples (including those mentioned above) on how to
better integrate sex and gender based analyses into R&I content under Horizon Europe
have been developed by the Commission’s Expert Group on Gendered Innovations
under the coordination of DG R&I’s Gender Sector.
A full policy report has been prepared and is available to support applicants.
Entitled Gendered Innovations 2: How inclusive analysis contributes to research and
innovation and publicly released by the European Commission on 25 November 2020, it
is available here, through the Europa website dedicated to gender equality policy in
R&I.
The report contains: full definitions of terms; both general and field-specific methods
for sex analysis, gender analysis and intersectional approaches; fifteen case studies
covering health, climate change, energy, agriculture, urban planning, waste
management, transport, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies, taxation,
venture funding, as well as COVID-19; and policy recommendations to address the
global challenges, targeted impacts and key R&I orientations of the six Horizon Europe
Clusters, as well as Mission Areas, and European partnerships.

SSH in the R&I chain
Under Horizon Europe, the effective integration of social SSH in all clusters, including all
Missions and European partnerships, is a principle throughout the programme. The aim
of SSH integration is to improve our assessment of and response to complex societal
issues. Thus, SSH are a key constituent of research and innovation, especially regarding
the twin green and digital transitions.
Therefore, where relevant, the R&I chain should include contributions from SSH
disciplines such as sociology, economics, psychology, political science, history, cultural
sciences or/and the arts. See the list of SSH disciplines below.
Project requirements - SSH flagged topics
Many topics invite contributions from the SSH, often in collaboration with non-SSH
disciplines such as natural and physical sciences, health sciences or technology. These
topics have been 'flagged' and can be found on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Proposals under these topics are expected to integrate the SSH perspective (social,
economic, behavioural, institutional, historical and/or cultural dimensions etc), as
appropriate. Applicants should therefore ensure that:
• contributions from SSH disciplines are integrated throughout their proposed
project, and
• the actions required, participants and disciplines involved as well as the added
value of SSH contributions are clearly stated in the proposal.
The SSH methodologies used in the projects should be described, or if the applicant
consortium considers that SSH is not relevant to their particular proposal, they should
explain why.
Where relevant, applicants are also encouraged to include contributions from the SSH in
a project proposal under any call, even if it is not SSH-flagged.
Evaluation
When evaluating a proposal submitted to a topic that was 'flagged' for SSH
contributions, experts will first refer to the topic description to identify what the
expected contributions are. With this in mind, they will evaluate the contributions from
SSH in the proposal, according to the criteria.
Experts should be mindful that a successful contribution from SSH, depending on the
topic, may require collaboration among various SSH disciplines and/or between SSH
and non-SSH disciplines.
A proposal without a sufficient contribution/integration of SSH research and
competences will receive a lower evaluation score.
Even if proposals do not belong to a topic 'flagged' for SSH contributions, they may
contain contributions from the SSH disciplines, which should be evaluated with other
relevant aspects of the proposal.

Innovations originate from many sources. They stem not only from advances in science
and technology, but also from creative uses of existing knowledge and technologies as
well as inventiveness in the non-technical and social spheres.
Social innovation concerns the development of new products, methods, and services for
and with society involving citizens, public authorities, business and industry, and
academia — the Quadruple Helix — in their design, development, and implementation.
Social innovation engages and empowers citizens, enhances the resilience of
communities, increases the relevance, acceptance and uptake of innovation, and helps
foster lasting changes in social practices, therefore acting as a system changer.
It thus helps answering societal and environmental challenges, connecting society with
innovation.
Social Innovation in Horizon Europe
Social innovation has been identified as a cross-cutting specific issue in Horizon Europe
and concerns all programme parts. Indeed, it holds potential to develop solutions
answering at once multiple interconnected challenges. Moreover, embedding social
innovation into the scope of a topic enhances the chances of uptake of the results of the
project by involving intended users from the beginning of the project to listen to them,
understand their needs, and benefit from their knowledge and creativity. Therefore, it
increases the delivery of the outcomes and impact expected from the project.
22EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
In Horizon Europe, social innovation will serve the environmental, economic, digital,
cultural, sovereignty, and democratic priorities set by the von der Leyen Commission.
In particular, social innovation will support changes towards socially, environmentally,
and economically sustainable social practices. More specifically, the integration of social
innovation on Horizon Europe is relevant to address global challenges – including in
areas such as health and care, also in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the twin
green and digital transitions, climate change mitigation and adaptation or citizen
engagement and deliberative democracy.
The above has been reflected by flagging specific topics and encouraging applicants to
consider social innovation as a way to meet the topic’s objectives, and by dedicating
topics to social innovation.

For all activities funded by the EU, the ethical dimension is an integral part of research
from beginning to end, and ethical compliance is seen as pivotal to achieve real
research excellence. There is a clear need to make a thorough ethical evaluation from
the conceptual stage of the proposal not only to respect the legal framework but also to
enhance the quality of the research. Ethical research conduct implies the application of
fundamental ethical principles and legislation to scientific research in all possible
domains of research. This includes the adherence to the highest standards of research
integrity as described in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity.
The process to assess and address the ethical dimension of activities funded under
Horizon Europe is called the Ethics Appraisal Procedure.
Objectives
In addition to the scientific evaluation focusing on the scientific merit, the quality of the
management and the potential impact, the Ethics Appraisal ensures that all research
activities carried out under Horizon Europe are conducted in compliance with
fundamental ethical principles.
Ethics Appraisal Procedure
The Ethics Appraisal Procedure concerns all activities funded in Horizon Europe and
includes the Ethics Review Procedure, conducted before the start of the project, as well
as Ethics Checks, Reviews and Audits conducted during the project.
When preparing a proposal, it is required to conduct an Ethics Self-assessment starting
with the completion of an Ethics Issues Table. You can read further practicalities in
the How to complete your ethics self-assessment guide.
Ethics Review Procedure
All proposals above threshold and considered for funding will undergo an Ethics Review
carried out by independent ethics experts. The Review starts with the Ethics Screening
which can include, in the cases where there is no ethics issue identified in the proposal,
a pre-screening to confirm or not the absence of ethics issues (this check can be
conducted by qualified staff). If appropriate a further analysis called the Ethics
23EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Assessment is conducted. The Ethics Assessment can lead to ethics requirements
that become contractual obligations.
The Ethics Review Procedure focusses on the compliance with ethical rules and
standards, relevant European legislation, international conventions and declarations,
national authorisations and ethics approvals, proportionality of the research methods
and the applicants' awareness of the ethical aspects and social impact of their planned
research.
The ethics review covers issues as:
• human rights and protection of human beings
• animal protection and welfare
• data protection and privacy
• health and safety
• environmental protection
• artificial intelligence
It may also cover issues of research integrity, including, fabrication, falsification and
plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research or in reporting research
results; this includes misrepresenting credentials and improprieties of authorship.
Ethics Screening
The Ethics Screening is carried out during the scientific evaluation or soon after. The
ethics experts are asked to flag the proposals that have serious or complex issues (on
the basis of the Guidelines on serious and complex ethics issues) that will be the
subject of a more in-depth analysis (Ethics assessment). Proposals involving the use of
human Embryonic Stems Cells (hESCs) or human Embryos (hE) automatically proceed
to the second step, the Ethics Assessment.
Further to the Ethics screening, the proposals that will be funded and are not flagged as
serious or complex must handle the ethics issues in the proposed activities in line with
National and European legislation and practice and the How to complete your ethics
self-assessment guide. The ethics summary report will list the main ethics issues
identified in your proposal. Ethics screening will not issue ethics requirements but can
lead to the obligation to nominate an external independent ethics advisor or board to
assist the project in adhering to the relevant ethical and legal standards.
Ethics Assessment
For the limited number of proposals flagged as serious or complex and for all the
proposals involving the use of hESCs or hE, the Ethics Screening is followed by an
Ethics Assessment prior to the signature of the grant agreement.
The Ethics Assessment is an in-depth analysis of the ethical issues of the proposals,
taking into account the analysis made during the Ethics screening. The Ethics
Assessment can lead to ethics requirements that are inserted as obligations in the grant
agreement.
If the proposal undergoes an Ethics Assessment, you will receive an ethics summary
report with an ethics opinion on your proposal. The possible outcomes of the ethics
assessment are:
1. Ethics clearance
24EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
The ethics issues are appropriately addressed. The ethics section in the proposal
can be transferred mostly unchanged to the ethics section in Part B of the
description of the action (DoA).
2. Conditional ethics clearance
In this case clearance is subject to conditions. Your ethics summary report will
list one or more 'ethics requirements'. These may include:
• regular reporting to the Commission or the agency concerned
• appointing an independent ethics advisor or ethics board (possibly with a
task to report on compliance with ethics requirements)
• supplying further information/documents
• adjusting methodology so as to comply with ethical principles and relevant
legislation
Ethics requirements must be implemented during grant preparation or during the
grant implementation.
• Ethics requirements due before grant signature normally require that
you update the ethics section in the narrative part (Part B) of the DoA
(Annex 1). However, other parts of Annex 1 may also be affected.
Exceptionally, additional supporting documents may be required before the
grant agreement can be signed.
• Ethics requirements due after project start are automatically included in
the grant agreement in the form of 'ethics deliverables'.
Tasks of the coordinator or sole applicant:
• update the DoA whenever appropriate to address the ethics requirements
and describe how they are to be met in the course of the project
• provide supporting documents if exceptionally requested before grant
signature
• take into account any recommendations set out in the ethics summary
report.
3. Request for additional information (intermediate outcome)
You may be asked to provide additional information if this is needed to complete
the ethics assessment (e.g. in case of serious or complex ethics issues or
missing information).
4. No ethics clearance
After the second ethics assessment, if your proposal is not given ethics
clearance, it is not eligible for funding and will be rejected.
You will be informed of
• the decision to reject your proposal
• the reasons for the decision
• how you can appeal against it.
25EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Ethics requirements and ethics work package
Ethics deliverables: All ethics requirements due after project start are automatically
included in the grant agreement in the form of deliverables. These deliverables are
known as 'ethics deliverables' and will be placed in an automatically generated work
package called 'ethics requirements'.
Work package 'ethics requirements' - if applicable - is added to your grant agreement
as soon as the ethics assessment has been completed. At this point in time it will
appear as the last work package in the list of work packages (WP). During grant
preparation you can move this WP to any other position in the list by drag & drop. It is
recommended to keep the 'ethics requirements' WP at the end of the list where it will
not affect the numbering of the other work packages.
Ethics checks, reviews and audits
During the Ethics Screening or the Ethics Assessment, the experts identify the projects
that need an Ethics Check or Review, which are executed during the course of the
research project. The procedure can also be initiated by the Commission services.
The objective of the procedure is to assist the beneficiaries to deal with the ethics
issues raised by their research and if necessary to take preventive or/and corrective
measures. The Ethics check is an internal check by the project officer or ethics officer
who may be supported by ethics experts and the Ethics Review is an elaborate review
and in-depth procedure carried out by up to 5 external ethics experts. They are both
conducted on the basis of the information provided by the concerned beneficiaries, who
may be invited to a meeting in Brussels to discuss the issues at stake. Onsite visits can
also be organised during the Ethics Reviews.
In case of substantial breach of ethical principles, research integrity or relevant
legislation, the Commission can carry out an Ethics Audit following the provisions and
procedures laid down in the grant agreement.
The checks, post-grant reviews and audits can result in an amendment of the grant
agreement. In severe cases, it can lead, upon the decision of the Commission services
to a reduction of the grant, its termination or any other appropriate measures, in
accordance with the provisions of the grant agreement.

Activities carried out under the programme must comply with the applicable security
rules and in particular, rules on the protection of classified information against
unauthorised disclosure, including compliance with any relevant EU and national law.
Where appropriate, the actions carried out under the Horizon Europe Programme must
comply with Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444, and its implementing rules.
The Horizon Europe Model Grant Agreement includes specific security related obligations
(Article 13 and Annex 5). The Horizon Europe Programme Security Instruction (PSI) has
to be followed in case a proposal selected for funding will lead to a project that involves
classified information.
The process to assess and address the security dimension of activities funded under
Horizon Europe is called the Security Appraisal Procedure.
Security Appraisal Procedure
The Security Appraisal Procedure concerns all activities funded under Horizon Europe
and includes three main steps: the Security Self-assessment, performed by the
applicants at the proposal preparation stage, the Security Review Procedure, conducted
before the start of the project, as well as the Security checks, conducted during or after
the life of the project.
Security Self-assessment
When preparing a proposal to be submitted under any of the Horizon Europe calls, the
applicant is required to conduct a Security Self-assessment starting with the completion
of a Security Issues Table. In case the proposal is submitted under a call or topic, which
is a priori flagged by the Commission as security sensitive, the applicant is also required
to complete a Security Section. Further information and guidance can be found in the
How to handle security-sensitive projects guide.
Security Review
Only proposals above threshold and considered for funding will undergo a Security
Review carried out by granting authority and Commission qualified staff, as well as by
national security experts.
The Security Review includes three steps: the Security Pre-screening performed by the
granting authority, the Security Screening performed by the Commission and the
Security Scrutiny conducted by national security experts. The Security Review is
28EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
organised based on whether the call or topic, under which a proposal is submitted, is
security sensitive or not and it can lead to security requirements that become
contractual obligations.
The Security Review Procedure focusses on the compliance with security rules and in
particular, on the protection of sensitive and classified information against unauthorised
disclosure. The objective of the Security Review is to identify and address security
issues that could emerge from the research by adopting appropriate mitigation
measures.
Security Pre-screening
The first phase of the Security Review Procedure, the Security Pre-Screening, is carried
out by qualified staff of the granting authority, during the scientific evaluation or soon
after, in the following cases:
• If the proposal has been submitted under a call or topic not flagged as security
sensitive and the applicant has replied positively to at least one of the questions
in the Security Issues table.
• If the proposal has been submitted under a call or topic not flagged as security
sensitive and the applicant has replied negatively to all the questions in the
Security Issues table, but the granting authority has, nevertheless, detected
security issues.
Security Screening
The Security Screening is performed by qualified staff of the Commission. All the
proposals that have gone through the Security Pre-screening will be automatically sent
to the second phase of the Security Review. During this phase, the Commission (DG
HOME) will assess the results of the pre-screening and decide whether the launch of the
third phase of the procedure, the Security Scrutiny, is needed.
Security Scrutiny
The Security Scrutiny is the last phase of the Security Review and it is conducted by the
Security Scrutiny Group, comprised of national security experts appointed in close
cooperation with the relevant Programme Committee and the competent National
Security Authorities. It is chaired by the Commission. The Security Scrutiny will be
carried out prior to the signature of the grant agreement in the following cases:
• Automatically, if the proposal has been submitted under a call or topic flagged as
security sensitive.
• In other cases, if the Security Screening has concluded that the proposal is very
likely to raise security issues for which mitigation measures should be proposed.
The objective of the Security Scrutiny is to identify security concerns in a certain
proposal, assess if sensitive or classified information will be used or produced by a
certain project, verify whether the security issues have been properly addressed by the
applicant and propose recommendations in order to properly address the identified
security issues. The purpose of the Security Scrutiny is to address potential misuse of
project results (e.g. results that could be channelled into crime or terrorism or results
that could adversely affect critical infrastructure). For additional information, see the
Guidance note on potential misuse of research. The information is classified according
to the Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe projects.
The Security Scrutiny may result in security requirements that, in principle, will have
to be fulfilled by the beneficiaries before the signature of the Grant Agreement. The
security requirements may include limiting the dissemination level of certain
29EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
deliverables for security reasons, classifying certain deliverables or other security
recommendations. Other security recommendations may include appointing a Project
Security Officer, establishing a Security Advisory Board, ensuring that personnel has
followed security trainings, limiting the level of detail, using a fake scenario, excluding
the use of classified information, adjusting the scope of a certain work package etc.
As the result of the Security Scrutiny a security summary report will be produced. It will
contain the security opinion and security recommendations. It will be provided to the
applicants at the stage of the grant preparation in order to implement the security
requirements.
The possible outcomes of the Security Scrutiny are:
1. No security concern
No security issues were identified in the proposal. No need for the Grant
Agreement to include a security section.
2. Security recommendations and/or security classification
The security summary report will list one or more security requirements. These
requirements should be set out in the security section of Part B of the DoA of the
Grant Agreement and may include:
• security recommendation to limit the dissemination level of certain
deliverables for security reasons
• classification of certain deliverables at a certain level (the classification
levels applied in Horizon Europe research projects are RESTREINT UE/EU
RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET UE/EU
SECRET)
• appointment of a Project Security Officer in case of classified deliverables
• establishment of a Security Advisory Board
• other security recommendations.
The security requirements must be implemented during grant preparation and
before grant signature. You will be required to update the security section in
the narrative part (Part B) of the DoA (Annex 1). In certain exceptional cases,
security requirements will be implemented during the grant implementation, e.g.
issue of Personnel Security Clearance.
3. Proposal too sensitive to be funded
The Security Scrutiny may reveal that the information to be used or generated
by the project is too sensitive, or that the applicants lack the right experience,
skills or authorisations to handle classified information at the appropriate level.
In such cases, funding is refused and the proposal is rejected.
If this happens, your report will contain the following information:
• the decision to reject your proposal;
• the reasons for the rejection, except if they are classified;
• the way to appeal against it.
Security Checks
30EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Where appropriate, the Commission or the relevant funding body may carry out security
checks.

Dissemination and exploitation is an obligation and opportunity for a project to
further scale-up the results, shed light on the work done and bring value to it by
creating a positive impact in various fields.
Dissemination and Exploitation activities help to diffuse knowledge, increase the use of
Research & Innovation (R&I) projects results in the EU and beyond and support a more
robust evidence-based policy making.
What is dissemination and exploitation?
They can be defined as:
• Dissemination: the public disclosure of the results by appropriate means (other
than resulting from protecting or exploiting the results), including by scientific
publications in any medium.
• Exploitation: the use of results in further research and innovation activities
other than those covered by the action concerned, including among other things,
commercial exploitation such as developing, creating, manufacturing and
marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in
standardisation activities.
• Results: Results’ means any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as
data, know-how or information, whatever its form or nature, whether or not it
can be protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual
property rights.
31EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
How should you address dissemination and exploitation?
The rules for participation under Horizon Europe10 reinforce focus on exploitation,
in particular within the EU as well as the role of the plan for the dissemination and
exploitation during and after the end of the project.
Unless the work programme states otherwise11, proposals should include a planned
summary of communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that they
will carry out to achieve the expected impact.
• If the expected exploitation of the results entails developing, creating,
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing
a service, the plan should include a strategy for such exploitation.
• If the plan provides for the exploitation of the results primarily in non-associated
third countries, the legal entities must explain how that exploitation is still to be
considered to be in the EU interest.
If the proposal is successful, then the beneficiaries must provide (normally with the first
six months of the action) and regularly update the complete Plan for the
exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities.
Beneficiaries must also report on the activities undertaken.
The applicant already at the stage of forming the consortium should pay attention to
eventual and expected results, ownership issues and the associated intellectual property
rights (IPR) with a view to disseminating and exploiting the results efficiently.
• The consortium agreement sets the framework for successful project
implementation and results exploitation including intellectual property
management, and is meant to settle if already possible all issues that might
hamper the smooth and seamless cooperation of the different actors for the
different parts of the project.
• Having a consortium agreement with clear IPR management and ownership
rights agreed by the consortium members can maximise the exploitation
potential of the project’s results.
• The consortium agreement should in principle be negotiated and concluded
before signing the grant agreement, and should complement the grant
agreement but must not contain any provision contrary to it.
• The consortium agreement is a private agreement between the beneficiaries
setting out the rights and obligations amongst themselves, and does not involve
the Commission/Agency.
During the implementation of the project and after the end of the action the
beneficiaries:
• must use their best efforts to exploit the research results or have them
exploited by another legal entity. If, despite a beneficiary's best efforts to exploit
its results directly or indirectly, the results are not exploited within one year
after the end of the action (as established in the grant agreement), the
10 Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing
Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for
participation and dissemination, and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1290/2013 and (EU) No 1291/2013
(OJ 12.5.2021 L 170/1).
11 Some proposers (e.g. applying in response to a European Research Council call, or the Marie-Sklodowska
Curie Actions-COFUND programme) are exempted from this obligation. Please refer to the work
programme.
32EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
beneficiary must (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the granting authority)
use the Horizon Results Platform to find interested parties to exploit the
results.
• where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations (including
obligations linked to the restriction of participation or control due to strategic
assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons), must comply with them — up
to four years after the end of the action.
• should also disseminate their results as soon as feasible, in a publicly available
format. Beneficiaries that intend to disseminate their results must give advance
notice to the other beneficiaries in the action. Any other beneficiary may object if
it can show that dissemination of the results would significantly harm its
legitimate interests in relation to its results or background. In such cases, the
results must not be disseminated unless appropriate steps are taken to
safeguard those legitimate interests.
The beneficiaries must update the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of
the results including communication activities, during and after the end of the action, in
accordance with the grant agreement.
To enhance dissemination and exploitation impact, the EU offers a wide range of
services free of charge such as Horizon Results Booster, Horizon Results Platorm, to
assist beneficiaries in dissemination and exploitation activities and to enhance visibility
of results.
Guidelines for your dissemination, exploitation and communication activities
We suggest you take a step-by-step approach to dissemination, exploitation and
communication activities while developing your proposal for an application and during
the implementation of the project. The guidelines below clarify key concepts and
provide with practical examples. They are by no mean compulsory.
The dissemination and exploitation part
1. Prepare your planned summary of communication, dissemination and
exploitation activities carefully.
This must be a distinct part of your proposal (unless excluded by the call conditions). As
it is too early to know what kind of results you will obtain, at this stage we only expect
a planned summary of communication, dissemination and exploitation activities. If
proposal is selected, you will be asked to submit a complete plan within 6 months after
the date of signature of your grant agreement and regularly update it.
In order to give you an idea of how these recommendations could be described in your
proposal, please see the following example of a water treatment project:
o Identify the problem/need to address
Example: In a context of pandemic, the current sand water treatment does not
filter against viruses. It requires the use of iodine and chlorine which in large
quantity may have an impact on health and the environment. Chlorine also has a
taste that makes it unpleasant for the consumer who then resorts to bottled
water.
o Check what is the current offer (e.g. the current existing solutions offered by
competitors)
33EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Example: The market usually offers: Reverse Osmosis (R.O.) Membranes,
Ultrafiltration (U.F.) Membranes, Micro-Filtration (M.F.) Membrane, Nano-
Filtration (N.F.) Membrane
o Describe what is the added value of your research, technology,
methodology
Example: Using techniques issued from biomimetics, to filter the water and
combat the viruses like live organisms do in nature
o Identify the Key Exploitable Result(s) (KER)
Example: Our KER will be an eco-friendly biomimetic membrane for filtering
water thereby removing 99% of viruses in water treatment plants.
o Explain what the outcome is (do not confuse it with the expected impact
to be addressed in the canvas of the application)
Example of the outcome: We would like to create a filtering membrane to treat
tap water. At the end of the project, the technology should be used by 10 water
treatment plants.
The expected impact will be: For companies and water treatment plants, our
technology is expected to reduce the costs in the long run (after the initial
investment) and the use of chemical product to treat the water. We plan on
testing the technology in X region(s) of the EU and this environmental friendly
technology should encourage help reducing the use of plastic bottles by
consumers who would then drink tap water.
o Identify the target groups (early adopters)
Example:
Target group: water treatment equipment manufacturers (filter manufacturers)
End users: water treatment plants that have been approached by the consortium
and agreed to test the technology
o Describe dissemination measures and channels to reach out to your
target audience
Example of dissemination measures: Organising visits for potential investors
and/or B2B to the demo plant. Participation in events such as trade fair
dissemination to increase awareness of our project amongst target user base,
including international conferences on water management & environment
o Describe exploitation measures
Examples of exploitation measures:
− Create a Demo plant to show the UVP (Unique Value Proposition) of the novel
solution
− Establish contacts with industry (B2B) e.g. scan main players in the water
treatment and gather information about the dynamics of target markets
− Reach out to end-users (regional water authorities, consumers) identified
during the dissemination activities to redefine/improve features of the
product
34EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
− Organise testbeds with end users (public authorities, companies in water
treatment, citizens)
o Describe how your results can feed back to policy-making and how they
contribute to the EU priorities
Example:Water treatment would contribute to higher quality of tap water at a
lesser cost with a better taste and the guarantee of a safer product (free of
viruses), thereby encouraging citizens to drink tap water instead of bottled
water, and reducing the impact on the environment, thereby contributing to the
green deal. We will reach out to the local authorities to raise their awareness and
get their support.
We will implement a mapping of stakeholders at the local governmental level.
For that we can rely on indicators as level of interest in water management but
also Go-to-market service from Horizon Results Booster.
We will create a white paper to be distributed to regional water authorities from
the region of A and B (where we intend to run the tests)
2. Involve potential end-users and stakeholders in your proposal.
If they are committed from early on, they may help guide your work towards specific
qualities and applications of your results. End-users could come from the regional,
national and international networks of consortium partners, or from the value chains
they operate in. They could be involved as partners in the project, or, throughout its
duration, as members of an advisory board or user group tasked with co-creating and
testing the results and providing feedback. In the case of policy recommendations, you
may want to approach policy-makers from a local/regional/national authorities, or
regulatory bodies in order to design your research project bearing in mind their needs.
3. Say how you expect the results of your project to be exploited/further
developed and give the main advantages of the new solution(s) you expect
to deliver.
The results could be, for example: a manual, test, model, new therapy, better product
or process, or an improved understanding of mechanisms and advantages for reduced
material or energy use, improved safety, or better-trained staff.
Explain how you expect the results like these to be exploited. This could also depend on
progress elsewhere in the innovation chain, in related projects or in adjacent fields - so
outline these dependencies and any progress to be made in these areas.
4. Link your proposal to the policy context of the call for proposals.
Think of how your project results will contribute to the outcomes specified in the calls
and topics and how they are linked to a wider impact in the longer term, specified in the
respective destinations of the work programme. Consider the following questions:
• What are the objectives of your project?
• Why and how they can be important in view of the work programme?
• What target audience (user communities? Parts of the society?) would benefit?
• Is it clear how the effects of your project can contribute to the outcomes or
wider impact?
5. Implement open science practices
35EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Think of use, ownership and access rights.
Open science practices are addressed and evaluated under ‘excellence’ as they are
considered a part of the methodology. However, open access in particular also results in
the broad dissemination of knowledge and is relevant in the context of dissemination.
Providing open access to peer-reviewed publications is mandatory in Horizon Europe,
when peer-reviewed publications are produced. Open access to generated research data
is required under the premise ‘as open as possible as closed as necessary’, meaning
that there can be exceptions to this. Data management plans are mandatory for all
projects generating or reusing data. Additionally, we recommend that you provide open
access to research outputs beyond publications and data and share them as early and
openly as possible.
Please consult the relevant sections under ‘open science’ for guidance on all of the
above and the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement for further guidance regarding the
requirements.
6. Show you understand the barriers to any exploitation of your results.
How will you tackle them?
Possible obstacles may include:
• Inadequate financing
• Skills shortages
• Other R&I work within and beyond Horizon Europe
• Regulation that hinders innovation12
• Ontellectual property right issues
• Traditional value chains that are less keen to innovate
• Incompatibility between parts of systems (lack of standards)
• Mismatch between market needs and the solution
• User behaviour
Your proposal should show you understand these impediments and how you will tackle
them. You may involve in your project experts in economics, business, marketing and
public administration that could help to overcome barriers.
In order to enhance your dissemination and exploitation activities, e.g. to draft the
plan, improve and follow-up on D&E activities, you can apply to Horizon Results Booster
during and after project implementation. The Horizon Results Booster is a free of charge
expert service to help effectively disseminate and exploit research results. As soon as
you have identified key exploitable results in your project, you can publish a profile of
your result(s) in Horizon Results Platform to promote the results, accelerate
matchmaking with potential investors, partners or other stakeholders of interest to you.
7. Think ahead. Once your research and innovation is complete, will you need
to take further steps to apply it in actual practice?
Examples of further steps: Standards to be agreed on, financing the testing and
prototyping, scaling up or production, promoting acceptance by consumers or other
12 See Innovation Principle, a tool to ensure that EU policies and legislation support innovation.
36EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
partners in a value chain. Policymakers may also establish follow-up steps to integrate
the results into policies.
You could also consider additional funding and support schemes for follow-up steps, e.g.
national programmes, EIC, Invest EU, Regional Funds, European Structural and
Investment Funds, Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), European IPR Helpdesk, Horizon
Results Platform, Horizon Results Booster, Dealflow and others.
The communication part
Since EU grants are financed by public funds, beneficiaries are generally expected to
actively engage in communication activities and to promote the projects.
Communication can be defined as: Taking strategic and targeted measures for
promoting the action itself and its results to a multitude of audiences, including the
media and the public, and possibly engaging in a two-way exchange.
Communication activities must already be part of the proposal and be described in the
draft Dissemination and exploitation plan including communication activities which is an
admissibility criterion.
A good communication plan should define clear objectives (adapted to various relevant
target audiences) and set out a description and timing for each activity.
With your communication activities you should draw the attention of general and
specialised audiences to the EU policy area addressed by the call.
Good communication:
• Starts at the outset of the action and continues throughout its entire lifetime.
• Is strategically planned and not just ad-hoc efforts.
• Identifies and sets clear communication objectives (e.g. have final and
intermediate communication aims been specified? What impact is intended?
What reaction or change is expected from the target audience?).
• Is targeted and adapted to audiences that go beyond the project's own
community, including the media and the public.
• Chooses relevant messages (e.g. how does the action's work relate to our
everyday lives? Why does the target audience need to know about the action?).
• Uses the right medium and means (e.g. working at the right level — local,
regional, national, EU-wide; using the right ways to communicate — one-way
exchange (website, press release, brochure, etc) or two-way exchange
(exhibition, school visit, internet debate, et.); where relevant, include measures
for public/societal engagement on issues related to the action).
• Is proportionate to the scale of the action.
Strategy for intellectual property management
Applicants must outline their strategy for the management of intellectual property (IP),
including intended protection measures (if relevant) and how these would be used to
support exploitation in the proposal (section on impact).
Particularly in the case of projects aimed at economic and societal exploitation, the
strategy for IP management must be commensurate with the desired outcomes and
impacts. Hence, a weakness or failure to submit such a strategy would also need to be
37EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
reflected in the proposal evaluation (scoring) with view to the ‘credibility’ of the
envisaged impact pathways.
Results ownership
1. What is the ownership of results?
The owner of results is the natural or legal entity that has generated the results.
Results are defined as any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as data,
know-how or information, whatever its form or nature, whether or not it can be
protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual property rights.
2. When do you have to address the ownership of your results?
The ownership of potential results should be addressed very early by the consortium
members when preparing the proposal.
3. Why does the results ownership matter?
Horizon Europe has the specific objective to strengthen the deployment and exploitation
of innovative solutions. This objective calls for transparency and clarity in terms of
results ownership.
The lack of clarity on the ownership of results can be one of the main obstacles for
exploitation and commercialisation, especially for SMEs. Clarity of results ownership is a
critical factor for attracting investors. Beneficiaries should also clarify their freedom to
operate without infringing on intellectual property owned by third parties that might
require specific action (e.g. licencing) to fully exploit the own intellectual property.
More practically speaking, it is important that potential future consortium members
decide on the ownership of results when drafting the proposal to simplify their lives as
beneficiaries. Indeed, beneficiaries must indicate the owner(s) of the results in the final
periodic report of the Horizon Europe project in the so called Results Ownership List. If
the ownership of results has not been carefully thought through at the proposal phase,
beneficiaries may face difficulties in filling in the Results Ownership List at the reporting
stage. Knowing that failure to fill in the Results Ownership List will block the submission
of the final periodic report and hence the payment, dedicating sufficient time on the
allocation of the ownership of results at the proposal phase will avoid hurdles at the end
of the project.
Standardisation
1. What is standardisation?
A standard is a document that sets the technical requirements of a product, service or
process and its use. Standards are adopted by recognised standardisation bodies (such
as ISO, CEN, CENELEC, ETSI, and many more). In these organisations, representatives
from industry, research, governments and civil society, discuss and agree on what
should be a standard. Once a standard is published, its use is normally voluntary but in
some cases certain specific standards can be made mandatory by law.
In other words, standards form a common language that allows researchers, people,
public institutions and industry to communicate, produce and commercialise products
and services in a harmonised manner. This is especially important in the European
single market.
2. Why is it important to consider standardisation when drafting a proposal?
Standards play an important role in the valorisation of research & innovation results:
38EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
They help researchers bring their innovation to the market and spread technological
advances by making their results transparent. In spreading the diffusion of new
technologies, standards provide both economic opportunities, facilitate realisation of
SDGs and give confidence to consumers that an innovative technology is safe.
They codify the technology requirements and inform both manufacturers and
consumers on what to expect.
They allow technologies and materials to be interoperable: since a standard provides
details on the use and content of a technology or a material, it is much easier to know
when and how it can be used in combination with other technologies.
In other words, by codifying information on the state of the art of a particular
technology, standards enable dissemination of knowledge (both within and outside the
relevant industry community). Moreover, standards bridge the gap between research
and products or services allowing the diffusion of the technology in the market and
increasing the probabilities of its take-up. Standardisation facilitates the deployment of
new technologies, interoperability between new products and services. Innovations can
more easily gain market acceptance and consumer trust if they comply with existing
standards for safety, quality, performance and sustainability.
If the project is relevant for standardisation it is advised for applicants to involve
standard development organisations in the consortium in order to facilitate the
valorisation of project results through standardisation.
What is meant by the Do No Significant Harm principle in the context of
Horizon Europe?
The Commission Communication on the European Green Deal13 introduced green oath
to ‘do no harm’. The ‘Do not Significant Harm’ (DNSH) principle has been further
specified in the EU Regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate
sustainable investments14, commonly defined as the ‘EU Taxonomy Regulation’. Six
environmental objectives are listed in Article 915 of the EU Taxonomy and Article 17
specifies what can constitute a ‘significant harm’ for these objectives:
1. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to climate change
mitigation if it leads to significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
2. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to climate change
adaptation if it leads to an increased adverse impact of the current climate and
the expected future climate, on the activity itself or on people, nature or assets;
3. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the sustainable
use and protection of water and marine resources if it is detrimental to the
good status or the good ecological potential of bodies of water, including surface
water and groundwater, or to the good environmental status of marine waters;
4. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the circular
economy, including waste prevention and recycling, if it leads to significant
13 COM (2019) 640, The European Green Deal.
14 The ‘EU Taxonomy Regulation’ refers to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework
to facilitate sustainable investment, by setting out a classification system (or ‘taxonomy’) for
environmentally sustainable economic activities.
15 Climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; sustainable and protection of water and marine
resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; protection and restoration
of biodiversity and ecosystems.
39EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
inefficiencies in the use of materials or in the direct or indirect use of natural
resources, or if it significantly increases the generation, incineration or disposal
of waste, or if the long-term disposal of waste may cause significant and long-
term environmental harm;
5. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to pollution
prevention and control if it leads to a significant increase in emissions of
pollutants into air, water or land;
6. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the protection and
restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems if it is significantly detrimental to
the good condition and resilience of ecosystems, or detrimental to the
conservation status of habitats and species, including those of EU interest.
References on the DNSH principle are included in the General Introduction of the
applicable Horizon Europe Work Programme (2021-2022 and 2023-2024) because of
their particular relevance for environmental outcomes and impacts.
At programming stage, the Horizon Europe work programme has been co-created to
support research and innovation activities that respect climate and environmental
priorities of the EU and cause no significant harm to them.
At project level, the reference to the DNSH principle in the Horizon Europe work
programme is included in the application form (proposal part B template) to offer
researchers the possibility to present the credential of their projects in relation to the
DNSH principle. Applicants can refer to the DNSH principle when presenting their
research methodology and the expected impacts of the project, to show that their
project will not carry out activities that make a significant harm to any of the six
environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation listed above.
However, evaluators will not score applications in relation to their compliance
with the DNSH principle unless explicitly stated in the work programme.
Open science in Horizon Europe
Open science is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of
knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the process. It has the potential
to increase the quality and efficiency of research and accelerate the advancement of
knowledge and innovation by sharing results, making them more reusable and
improving their reproducibility. It entails the involvement of all relevant knowledge
actors.
Horizon Europe moves beyond open access to open science for which it features
a comprehensive policy implemented from the proposal stage to project reporting. The
Horizon Europe Regulation sets the legal basis for the open science obligations and
incentives that apply to Horizon Europe beneficiaries. The AGA — Annotated Grant
Agreement provides guidance on how to comply with the open science obligations
required in the Model Grant Agreement. The present guide complements the
information provided in the Annotated Grant Agreement, with a particular
focus on the preparation of proposals.
40EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
In Horizon Europe, open science practices are considered in the evaluation of proposals,
under ‘Excellence’ and under the ‘Quality and efficiency of implementation’.16 There are
mandatory open science practices, which are required for all projects through the Model
Grant Agreement and/or through the work programme or call conditions, and
recommended practices (all open science practices that are not mandatory).
Recommended open science practices are incentivised through their the evaluation at
the proposal stage. Proposers should be aware of both mandatory and recommended
practices and integrate them into their proposals.
Open science practices include early and open sharing of research (for example
through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, or crowd-sourcing); research
output17 management; measures to ensure reproducibility of research outputs;
providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software,
models, algorithms, and workflows); participation in open peer-review; and involving all
relevant knowledge actors including citizens, civil society and end users in the co-
creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as citizen science).
These practices are explained and relevant resources provided in a separate section
further below (open science practices and resources).
Mandatory open science practices
• Some open science practices are mandatory for all beneficiaries per the grant
agreement. They concern:
o open access to scientific publications under the conditions required by the
grant agreement;
o responsible management of research data in line with the FAIR principles of
‘Findability’, ‘Accessibility’, ‘Interoperability’ and ‘Reusability’, notably
through the generalised use of data management plans, and open access to
research data under the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as
necessary’, under the conditions required by the grant agreement;
o information about the research outputs/tools/instruments needed to validate
the conclusions of scientific publications or to validate/re-use research data;
o digital or physical access to the results needed to validate the conclusions of
scientific publications, unless exceptions apply;
o in cases of public emergency, if requested by the granting authority,
immediate open access to all research outputs under open licenses or, if
exceptions apply, access under fair and reasonable conditions to legal
entities that need the research outputs to address the public emergency18.
These obligations are described in the Model Grant Agreement (Article 17) and detailed
guidelines on complying with them are provided in the Annotated Grant Agreement
(Article 17).
• Some open science practices are mandatory per specific work programmes or
call conditions, which may provide for additional obligations to adhere to open
science practices.
16 This does not apply to the ERC programme that does not include open science in the evaluation. It also
does not include EIC transition calls where open science practices are exceptionally evaluated under
‘impact’.
17 These are results generated by the action to which online access can be given in the form of scientific
publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such as software, algorithms, protocols
and electronic notebooks.
18 The additional provision on access in cases of public emergency does not apply to the ERC.
41EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Recommended open science practices
These are open science practices beyond the mandatory ones, such as involving all
relevant knowledge actors, including citizens, early and open sharing of research,
output management beyond research data, open peer-review. This is a non-exhaustive
list of practices that proposers are expected to adopt when possible and appropriate for
their projects. Finally, certain work programme topics or call conditions may encourage
specific additional open science practices.
Evaluation of open science practices
Open science practices are evaluated under the ‘Excellence’ criterion (in particular
under methodology) and under the ‘Quality and efficiency of implementation’
award criterion. Proposers should address open science practices in the relevant section
on open science under methodology19.
Proposers will have to provide concrete information on how they plan to comply with
the mandatory open science practices. Failure to sufficiently address this, will result
in a lower evaluation score.
A clear explanation of how they will adopt recommended practices, as appropriate for
their projects, will result in a higher evaluation score.
If proposers believe that none of the open science practices (mandatory or
recommended) apply to their project, then they have to provide a justification.
Under the ‘Excellence’ part of their proposals, in the section on methodology,
proposers should describe how open science practices (mandatory and recommended,
as appropriate) are implemented as an integral part of the methodology and show how
their implementation is adapted to the nature of their work, therefore increasing the
chances of the project delivering on its objectives. Information relevant to the specific
area of the proposal should be provided in no more than one page. If open science
practices are not applicable to the proposal, justifications should be provided sp that, if
evaluators agree, open science will not be taken into consideration in the evaluation.
Additionally, proposers generating or reusing data should outline in a maximum of one
(additional) page their plans for data management.
Under ‘Capacity of participants and consortium as a whole’, proposers should
describe how the consortium brings together the necessary disciplinary and inter-
disciplinary knowledge. Proposers should show how this includes expertise and/or track
record in open science practices, relevant to what is planned for the project. If
justification has been provided that open science practices are not relevant for their
projects, it is not necessary to demonstrate track record and expertise.
Finally, in Part A of their proposals, proposers are asked to list up to five relevant
publications, widely used datasets or other achievements of consortium members that
they consider significant for the action proposed. Open access is expected for
publications, in particular journal articles, while datasets are expected to be FAIR and
‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. If publications are not open access,
proposers are strongly encouraged to deposit them retroactively in repositories and
provide open access to them when possible. The significance of publications will not be
evaluated on the basis of the Journal Impact Factor of the venue they are published in,
but on the basis of a qualitative assessment provided by the proposers for each
publication.
19 The information in this section does not apply to the ERC programme, which does not include open
science in the evaluation.
42EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
How should you address open science practices in your proposal?
Make sure to read the Annotated Grant Agreement on the mandatory open science
practices in combination with this guide20.
Early and open sharing: Provide specific information on whether and how you will
implement early and open sharing and for which part of your expected output. For
example, you may mention what type of early and open sharing is appropriate for your
discipline and project, such as preprints or preregistration/registration reports, and
which platforms you plan to use.
Research data management (RDM): RDM is mandatory in Horizon Europe for
projects generating or reusing data. If you expect to generate or reuse data and/or
other research outputs (except for publications), you are required to outline in a
maximum of one page how these will be managed. Further details on this are provided
in the proposal template in the relevant section on open science. A full data
management plan (DMP) is not required at submission stage. For those work
programmes that require the use of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)
federated repositories, proposers should explicitly discuss the use of such repositories in
their proposals. By exception, in cases of a public emergency and if the work
programme requires so, you should submit a full DMP already with submission of
proposals or at the latest by the signature of the grant agreement. A template for a
DMP is provided under the reporting templates in the Funding & Tenders Portal
Reference Documents page.
Reproducibility of research outputs: you should outline the measures planned in the
project that tend to increase reproducibility. Such measures may already be
interweaved in other parts of the methodology of a proposal (such as transparent
research design, the robustness of statistical analyses, addressing negative results, etc)
or in mandatory/non-mandatory open science practices (e.g. the DMP, early sharing
through preregistration and preprints, open access to software, workflows, tools, etc) to
be implemented. More detailed suggestions on good practices for enhancing
reproducibility and resources in the relevant section below.
Horizon Europe requires information via the repository where publications and data
have been deposited on any research output or any other tools and instruments - data,
software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks and others -
needed for the re-use or validation of the conclusions of scientific publications and the
validation and reuse of research data. Further, beneficiaries must provide digital or
physical access to data or other results needed for the validation of the conclusions of
scientific publications, to the extent that their legitimate interests or constraints are
safeguarded21. More details on these requirements for reproducibility and guidance on
how to meet them are provided in the AGA (article 17).
Open access: Offer specific information on how you will meet the open access
requirements, that is deposition and immediate open access to publications and open
access to data (the latter with some exceptions and within the deadlines set in the
DMP) through a trusted repository, and under open licenses. You may elaborate on the
(subscription-based or open access) publishing venues that you will use. You may also
elaborate on the trusted repository/repositories through which open access to
publications and research data will be provided (article 17). Open access to research
data and other research outputs should be addressed in the section on research data
management of your proposal. Research data should be open as a default, unless there
20 The information in this section does not apply to the ERC programme, which does not include open
science in the evaluation.
21 This does not apply to ERC calls.
43EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
are legitimate reasons for keeping them closed. On open access to data and the
legitimate reasons for restricting access, consult the AGA (article 17).
As a general rule, open access to other research outputs such as software, models,
algorithms, workflows, protocols, simulations, electronic notebooks and others is not
required but strongly recommended. Access to ‘physical’ results like cell lines,
biospecimens, compounds, materials, etc. is also strongly encouraged.
Open peer review: Anytime it is possible, you are invited to prefer open peer review
for your publications over traditional (‘blind’ or ‘closed’) peer review. When the case,
you should provide specific information regarding the publishing venues you envisage to
make use of, and highlight the venues that would qualify as providing open peer review.
Citizen, civil society and end-user engagement: Provide clear and succinct
information on how citizen, civil society and end-user engagement will be implemented
in your project, where/if appropriate. The kinds of engagement activities will depend on
the type of R&I activity envisaged and on the disciplines and sectors implicated.
This may include: co-design activities (such as workshops, focus groups or other means
to develop R&I agendas, roadmaps and policies) often including deep discussion on the
implications, the ethics, the benefits and the challenges related to R&I courses of action
or technology development; co-creation activities (involving citizens and/or end-users
directly in the development of new knowledge or innovation, for instance through
citizen science and user-led innovation); and co-assessment activities (such as assisting
in the monitoring, evaluation and feedback to governance of a project, projects, policies
or programmes on an iterative or even continual basis).
The extent of engagement in the proposal could range from one-off activities alongside
other methodological approaches to being the primary focus or methodological
approach of the project itself. Engagement will require resources and expertise and is
therefore often conducted by dedicated interlocutor organisations or staff with relevant
expertise. More detailed information on these activities and useful resources developed
over the course of Horizon 2020 can be found in the relevant section below.
Open science practices and relevant resources
Early and open sharing of research
‘Early and open sharing’ means making research work, methodologies, outputs, such as
data and software, among others, and findings available as soon as possible in the
research process. Examples of such early sharing include preregistration, registered
reports and pre-prints. Early-sharing practices support reproducibility in the research
and helps researchers secure precedence over their findings and/or conclusions.
Preregistration of the research plan in a public repository makes available the
research hypothesis, study design and planned analysis before data is collected.
Preregistration is assisted by dedicated platforms; it increases the transparency,
credibility and reproducibility of the results and helps addressing publication bias toward
positive findings.
Registered reports are research articles that are peer-reviewed and published in two
stages. The study design and analysis plan including hypothesis and methodology
undergo peer-review of the quality and suitability of the research question and protocol.
If accepted, research protocols are preregistered (see preregistration) and the final
research article is provisionally accepted for publication. After the research is
conducted, an article containing the results and discussion as well as any changes is
submitted and undergoes a second round of peer-reviewing. Registered reports reduce
publishing bias for positive results as the acceptance for publication is based on the
quality of the research, regardless of the outcome.
44EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Preprints are scientific manuscripts that are publicly shared prior to peer-review and
journal publication via preprint platforms. An increasing number of journals accepts
sharing of preprints prior to publication, but there are exceptions. Beneficiaries have to
check the policy of their target journal to clear that a preprint will not pre-empt its
publication.

Research data management and management of other research outputs
Research data management (RDM) is the process within the research lifecycle that
includes the data collection or acquisition, organisation, curation, storage, (long-term)
preservation, security, quality assurance, allocation of persistent identifiers (PIDs),
provision of metadata in line with disciplinary requirements, licencing, and rules and
procedures for sharing of data. RDM is an essential element in any project that
generates, collects or re-uses data. Planning ahead to data needs that proposers are
45EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
likely to encounter during the project is a best practice. For example, provisions need to
be in place to ensure that data is managed responsibly (e.g. the right venue is chosen
for deposition, adequate are issued, legal provisions such as General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) are respected, etc). Further, data management should be in line
with the FAIR principles22, to ensure that researchers can find, access and re-use each
other’s data, maximising the effectiveness and reproducibility of the research
undertaken.
RDM, in line with the FAIR principles is a requirement that should be carried out
regardless of whether the data generated and re-used in the project is intended to be
openly accessible, or if access restrictions are foreseen. FAIR data is not equivalent to
open data (publicly available to everyone to access and reuse). Data can, and should be
FAIR even when access is restricted.
RDM and the FAIR principles can be applied to research outputs other than data (i.e.
workflows, protocols, software, samples, etc). Proposers are recommended to consider
robust management practices for data and other research outputs as early as the
proposal stage of their project.
Below are important elements and resources for RDM useful already at proposal stage.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are key in ensuring the findability of research outputs,
including data. They are globally unique and long-lasting references to digital objects
(such as data, publications and other research outputs) or non-digital objects such as
researchers, research institutions, grants, etc. Frequently used persistent identifiers
include digital object identifiers (DOIs), Handles, and others. For further reading on PID
types, please refer to https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/technical-solutions-and-
tools/persistent-identifiers.
To enhance the findability of research outputs, and their potential reuse, standardised
metadata frameworks are essential, ensuring that data and other research outputs
are accompanied by rich metadata that provides them with context.
To enhance the re-usability of research data, they must be licenced. For more
information on the licences required for data under Horizon Europe, please refer to the
AGA (article 17).
Trusted repositories assume a central role in the Horizon Europe for the deposition of
and access to publications and research data. For a definition of trusted repositories in
Horizon Europe please refer to the AGA (article 17). Proposers, with the help of data
and research support staff (e.g. data stewards, data librarians, etc), should check
whether the repositories that they plan to deposit their data have the features of
trusted repositories, and justify this accordingly in their Data Management Plans.
Data management plans (DMPs) are a cornerstone for responsible management of
research outputs, notably data and are mandatory in Horizon Europe for projects
generating and/or reusing data (on requirements and the frequency of DMPs as
deliverables consult the AGA article 17). A template for a DMP is provided under the
reporting templates available on the Funding & Tenders Portal Reference documents
page. Its use is recommended but not mandatory. DMPs are formal documents that
outline from the start of the project all aspects of the research data lifecycle, which
includes its organisation and curation, and adequate provisions for its access,
preservation, sharing, and eventual deletion, both during and after a project. Writing a
DMP is part of the methodology of the project, since good data management makes the
work more efficient, saves time, contributes to safeguarding information and to
22 FAIR data are data that are curated to satisfy the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability,
and reusability. For further reading: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/
46EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
increasing the value of the data among the beneficiaries themselves and others, during
and after the research. DMPs are thus a key means of support when planning and
conducting a research project, and, ideally, filling in a DMP should be started prior to
the beginning of the project.
DMPs play a key role in helping researchers to adequately manage research outputs
other than data and publications, also in line with the FAIR principles. Such research
outputs may be physical or digital, and include original software created during the
project, workflows, protocols, new materials such as samples, cell-lines, antibodies,
among many others. DMPs should reflect an adequate management strategy for such
outputs as well.
A DMP should be a living document, which is updated and enriched as the project
evolves. Such updates might occur after attaining milestones related e.g. to the
generation of new data or to reflect changes related to the original planning, changes in
data/output access provisions or curation policies, changes in consortium practices (e.g.
new innovation potential, decision to file for a patent), changes in consortium
composition, etc.
A good practice regarding DMPs is to register them as a non-restricted public
deliverables to make them openly accessible, unless legitimate reasons exist to keep
them confidential. An additional good practice is to publish the DMP in specialised
journals or publishing platforms such as RIO etc., or to deposit them in DMP-specific
public repositories such as DMPOnline and others.
As practices with regard to data management, storage, and sharing differ widely across
disciplines, the DMPs should reflect common disciplinary practices. In addition to
domain specificities, DMPs across the board should address an overarching set of data-
related requirements including those aspects related to making the data FAIR. Common
aspects that need to be addressed in all DMPs include23:
• Data set description: a sufficiently detailed description of the data generated
or re-used, including the scientific focus and technical approach to allow
association of their data sets with specific research as well as information on
data types and an estimate of the data set’s size.
• Standards and metadata: the protocols and standards used to structure the
data (i.e. fully reference the metadata) so that other scientists can make an
assessment and reproduce the dataset. If available, a reference to the
community data standards with which their data conform and that make them
interoperable with other data sets of similar type.
• Name and persistent identifier for the data-sets: a unique and persistent
identification (an identifier) of the data sets and a stable resolvable link to where
the data sets can be directly accessed. Submission to a public repository
normally provides this; many institutional repositories provide similar services.
• Curation and preservation methodology: information on the standards that
will be used to ensure the integrity of the data sets and the period during which
they will be maintained, as well as how they will be preserved and kept
accessible in the longer term. A reference to the public data repository in which
the data will be/is deposited with relevant consideration on whether the chosen
repository meets the requirements of a trusted repository.
23 These aspects are broadly in line with the requirements set forth in Science Europe’s Practical Guide to
the International Alignment of Research Data Management:
https://www.scienceeurope.org/media/4brkxxe5/se_rdm_practical_guide_extended_final.pdf
47EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Data sharing methodology: information on how the data sets can be
accessed, including the terms-of-use or the license under which they can be
accessed and re-used, and information on any restrictions that may apply or
relevant security and privacy considerations. It is also important to specify and
justify the timing of data sharing. On open access to research data see below
relevant section on open access.
• Output management, for research outputs other than data and
publications: The section on output management should show efforts to
manage outputs in line with the FAIR principles, including a detailed description
of the output, consider relevant metadata standards and the provision of PIDs
when depositing the output, or its digital representation if it is physical. The plan
should further detail the deposition, curation and preservation methodology
foreseen, identifying the right home for the output, and it should set out an
approach likely to maximise the re-use and adoption of the output by the wider
research community. If the output is physical, the plan should indicate how it
would be made available to potential users.
• Costs and personnel related to RDM: An estimation of costs related to RDM
such as costs for data collection, data documentation, data storage, data access
and security, data preservation, data availability and reuse as well as the
person/team responsible for data management and quality assurance processes.
The European Open Science Cloud
The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) aims to deploy and consolidate an open,
trusted virtual environment to enable circa 2 million European researchers to store,
share, process, analyse, and reuse research digital objects including data, publications
and software across disciplines and borders. A European co-programmed Partnership
approach for EOSC has been proposed for the period 2021-2030 (https://eosc.eu/). It
will bring together institutional, national and European initiatives and engage all
relevant stakeholders to deploy a European Research Data Commons where data are
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR). This European contribution to a
Web of FAIR Data and Related Services for Science will support open science in a
deepened European Research Area and provide the basis for the research and
innovation data space foreseen in the European Strategy for Data.
Certain work programmes may require the use of trusted repositories that are federated
in EOSC for depositing research data. In that case, data must be deposited in
repositories which are registered to the EOSC and support (implicitly or explicitly) the
FAIR principles. An initial offering of EOSC resources and services can be found from the
EOSC Portal. This offering is expected to continue growing in function of the EOSC rules
of participation.

Measures to ensure reproducibility of results
Reproducibility is the possibility for the scientific community to obtain the same results
as the originators of specific findings. Reproducibility of some or all results is important
as it increases the performance of research & innovation (wider use of research
results); it limits waste of resources (less duplication and fewer false baselines); it
increases the quality and the reliability of research (stronger methods, controls and
reporting); and, as a result, it may increase the trust of citizens in science. Therefore,
reproducibility is integral part of ‘Excellence’; we expect the results of Horizon Europe to
be reproducible, and planning should start at proposal stage to make results reusable
and reproducible.
Below is a list of practices which tend to increase reproducibility. Some of them may
already be required by the MGA (for example DMP, FAIR) or by specific calls and
proposers may interweave such practices in various parts of the methodology section as
appropriate:
• Specify with precision and no ambiguities the research design and the
methodologies that you will be applying.
• Specify how you will deal with negative results, if any, so that others can lean
from your project regarding of its outcomes.
• Make prior searches and checks on existing results and data to ensure you are
not duplicating unnecessarily.
• Specify how you are making use of pre-prints, preregistration of protocols and
registered reports (see above, ‘Early sharing of research results’), to ensure that
your method and research questions are accountable, if applicable.
• Detail the steps you will take to make your research process and tools (software,
materials, protocols, flows, ...) transparent and available during and after the
research.
• Mention the steps, if any, that you will take to ensure the validity and the quality
of the project’s process and results (e.g. peer review, knowledge sharing,
independent testing, supervision, quality control mechanisms).
49EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Plan to use the DMP to the full extent possible to detail the assets and materials
underlying your data collection and analysis (see above, ‘DMP’).
• Ensure that your data are FAIR so that others can find them and re-use them to
reproduce your results (see above, ‘FAIR’).
• Specify how you will ensure robust statistical analysis, that can be repeated
(power of sample, robust experimental techniques, open software, ...).
• Specify what ‘common assets’ for research & innovation your project will be
building, if any, including knowledge bases, methodologies, evaluation
frameworks, ontologies, open repositories, etc.
• Make provisions to validate, demonstrate, make interoperable, scale-up and
overall make replicable the results of your R&I activities.
• Consider whether your project will produce digital copies of your results, e.g.
Digital Twins, virtual bodies, digital blueprints, that increase the likelihood of re-
use and reproducibility.

• An extensive list of resources is provided by the Centre for open science
• Information and resources provided by networks focusing on reproducibility, for
example in the UK, Germany, Switzerland
• Guidelines and toolkits on reproducibility, especially specific to your field (e.g. in
biomedical research).
Open access to research outputs
Open access is online access at no cost for the end user of research outputs such as
scientific publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes (e.g. software,
models, algorithms, protocols and electronic notebooks). Open access often carries less
restrictive copyright and licensing barriers than traditionally published works, for both
the users and the authors.
Open access enables increased quality and efficiency of research and accelerates the
advancement of knowledge and innovation by making results reusable and by
improving their reproducibility. It also offers the means for more creativity, more trust
in science and greater impacts by building on collective intelligence, facilitating cross-
disciplinary research and involvement of all relevant knowledge actors, including
citizens.
Horizon Europe requires deposition of scientific peer-reviewed publications and research
data and open access (with exceptions for research data) following specific
requirements. For guidance on this consult the AGA (article 17).
While it is not mandatory to publish (if a project intends to exploit its results, it may
decide not to publish), if scientific peer-reviewed publications are produced then
they must be open access immediately at publication time under open licenses (such as
Creative Commons), providing specific minimum sets of rights of reuse (CC BY for
articles and book chapters in edited books and CC BY, CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-
ND or equivalent for long-text formats. The following checklist shows what users can do

It is important to be aware that Horizon Europe requires that enough intellectual
property rights are maintained by beneficiaries or authors to ensure the required open
access to scientific publications.
Proposers should be aware that beneficiaries are required to retain sufficient intellectual
property rights (IPR) to comply with their open access obligations. Authors may need to
interact with prospective publishers, in particular when they publish in venues that are
not open access. To facilitate compliance with their open access obligations,
beneficiaries/researchers are encouraged to notify publishers of their grant agreement
obligations (including the licensing requirements) already at manuscript submission. For
example, by adding the following statement to their manuscript: “This work was funded
by the Εuropean Union under the Horizon Europe grant [grant number]. As set out in
the Grant Agreement, beneficiaries must ensure that at the latest at the time of
publication, open access is provided via a trusted repository to the published version or
the final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication under the latest available
version of the Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or a
licence with equivalent rights. CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-ND or equivalent
licenses could be applied to long-text formats.” If the publishing agreement is contrary
to the grant agreement obligations, authors should negotiate its terms and,
alternatively, look for a different publishing venue/options.
Data should be deposited in a trusted repository as soon as possible after data
production and at the latest by the end of the project. Data underpinning a scientific
publication should be deposited at the latest at the time of publication and in line with
standard community practices. Beneficiaries of Horizon Europe have to ensure open
access to research data generated in their projects under the principle ‘as open as
possible and as closed as necessary’. This means that data is in principle open, unless
beneficiaries decide to restrict access to some or all their research data for legitimate
51EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
reasons. On open access to data and the legitimate reasons for restricting access
consult the AGA (article 17) and section above on research data management.
Open access to other research outputs, such as software, workflows and others, will
ensure that these outputs that have been generated by Horizon Europe actions are also
freely accessible to all. This will promote transparency, efficiency and reproducibility, as
well as trust in science, and will facilitate access for citizens. Proposers/beneficiaries are
also encouraged to license research outputs other than publications and data under
appropriate licenses. With regard to software, it should be noted that with the exception
of CC0 (i.e. public domain dedication) CC licenses are not appropriate (although they
can be used for software documentation). Instead, the use of appropriate software
licenses, such as those listed as free by the Free Software Foundation and listed as
open source by the Open Source Initiative, is strongly recommended.

Publishing using open peer-review
Open peer review is an umbrella term for various alternative review methods that seek
to make classical peer review more transparent and accountable. It has neither a
standardised definition, nor an agreed schema of its features and implementations.
Open peer review refers to a peer review process that contains one or more of these
elements24:
• Authors and reviewers are aware of each other’s identity during or after the
review process.
• Review reports are published alongside the relevant article.
• The wider community is able to contribute to the review process (peer
researcher or even general public).
• Manuscripts are made immediately available in advance of the formal peer
review procedure.
• Review or commenting on the final ‘version of record’ is made possible.
• Direct, reciprocal discussion between authors and reviewers and/or between
reviewers is allowed and encouraged.
• Review can be decoupled from publishing when facilitated by a different
organisational entity than the venue of publication (e.g. publishing platforms).
Some journals and scholarly publishers apply open peer review. Some platforms,
including preprint servers, may also facilitate open peer review of preprints. For
example, Open Research Europe, the open access publishing platform of the European
Commission uses the open peer review model, where both names of authors and
reviewers are public, and the review report is open access.
Open peer review is an important aspect of open science. Opening up what has
traditionally been a closed process increases opportunities to spot errors, validate
findings and to increase the overall trust in published outputs. Open peer-review is
considered by some among the measures that increase the quality of the peer review
process (by making it more constructive), and the transparency of research (with
'openness' applying to all processes in the scientific workflow). Another argument to
engage in open peer review is that it ensures reviewers to get credit for their efforts.

(https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/learning/open-peer-review)
Open Research Europe (https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu) supports open
peer review in all scientific fields for all Horizon Europe publications.
Some discipline-specific venues support open peer review and are suitable for the life
sciences (e.g. eLIFE, Bio Med Central, BMJ, GIGA science and BioRxiv, ASAPbio), the
social sciences (e.g. SAGE open, Wiley and SocArXiv) and the arts and humanities
(SAGE open, Wiley and digitalculturebooks).
Citizen, civil society and end-user engagement
Citizen and civil society engagement is a programme principle and operational objective
that refers to the opening up of R&I processes to society to develop better, more
innovative and more relevant outcomes, and to increase societal trust in the processes
and outcomes of R&I.
Opening up the R&I system towards society and supporting citizens, civil society and
end-users to participate in R&I – as sources of ideas, knowledge and/or data, as data
collectors and/or analysers, and/or as testers and/or end users – enlarges the collective
intelligence, capabilities and scope of the R&I and is likely to lead to greater creativity
and robustness of the outcomes and reduced time-to-market of the innovative products
and services. It also increases the relevance and responsiveness of R&I, ensuring that
its outcomes align with the needs, expectations and values of society. Moreover, it is a
key element for improving the transparency, co-ownership and trust of society in the
process and outcomes of R&I. Conducting R&I openly, responsibly, transparently, and in
adherence to the highest standards of research integrity and ethics is also important for
responding to increased science denial.
Engagement can range from the identification and conceptualisation of R&I priorities
(e.g. through deliberative or other participatory processes), to the implementation,
utilisation and assessment of R&I results (e.g. through data collection, data analysis,
discussion and publication or presenting scientific results, working in fab-labs to develop
new innovations, testing innovations and solutions, and evidence-based advocacy).
The following are activities that proposers may consider including in their proposal:
Co-design activities could involve workshops, focus groups or other means to develop
R&I agendas, roadmaps or policies. These could be one-off activities in one or several
different localities or repeated consultations with the same or varying groups. They
could involve citizens and/or one or many organisation types at the same time. Co-
design activities often include deep discussion on the implications, the ethics, the
benefits and the challenges related to R&I courses of action or technology development.
Co-design could be the overall focus of a project (e.g. to develop a roadmap for a
certain technology), a Work Package within a project that uses the outcomes of the co-
design in subsequent Work Packages, or a supporting Work Package that provides
continual feedback on project activities throughout the project cycle.
Co-creation activities, such as citizen science or user-led innovation, involve citizens or
end-users directly in the development of new knowledge or innovations, through a
range of different levels of participation. These could include identifying R&I questions
to be tackled by the project, developing a methodology, observing, gathering and
processing data, right up to the publication and presentation of results. The co-creation
activities could be the focus of a proposal, or could be one of the methodological
approaches taken alongside others.
54EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Co-assessment activities, such as assisting in the monitoring and evaluation of the
progress of the project, portfolio of projects, policies or programmes, help ensure an
iterative or even continual process of interaction with citizens, civil society and end-
users throughout the project cycle on the quality, utilisation and (potential) impact of
project outputs.
In certain cases, citizens, civil society and end-users may be involved across different
stages of the R&I and/or policy cycle, by deciding on the research to be conducted,
conducting that research, analysing and interpreting the data, and engaging in related
advocacy or policy activities.
An important aspect to consider in many cases is the inclusivity of the engagement and
ensuring diversity of participation. The challenge of sustaining engagement should not
be underestimated and different forms of compensation or rewards could be considered,
as well as measures for two-way learning between scientists or innovators and the co-
creators.
Engagement requires resources and expertise. Often, engagement is conducted by
dedicated interlocutor organisations that already have the reach, trust, and expertise to
successfully carry out the engagement exercises. The integration of the engagement
activities, and their outcomes within the project design, should aim to ensure use of the
outcomes (i.e. they are not ‘window dressing’ or unimportant side-activities), and that
there is appropriate feedback and acknowledgement to the engaged. If the call
conditions allow it, the launch of calls for small grants or prizes can be useful (or in
some other cases even essential) for reaching and engaging local communities and
small associations, civil society organisations, social enterprises, or small businesses.
Generally, the greater the interaction from across the quadruple helix (academia-
industry-government-civil), the more the R&I results will be reliable, trusted and taken
up by society. Different organisation types, and different societal perspectives, help
ensure that the processes and the outcomes of the R&I align with the needs, values and
expectations of society. In many cases, the body of knowledge and practice built up in
Horizon 2020 on Responsible Research and Innovation will be relevant.
Co-design, co-creation, and co-assessment, as (sometimes) radical departures from
more traditional forms of R&I, could imply changes to the institutional governance of
the participating beneficiaries that last beyond the lifetime of project funding.
Terminology:
• ‘Citizens’ should be understood as individuals acting on their own initiative and
not on behalf of their employer or sectoral interests. It does not refer to any
legal citizenship(s) that people may or may not hold.
• ‘Civil society’ refers to the ensemble of citizens and civil society organisations
that are active in the public sphere but distinct from government and business.
• ‘Civil society organisations (CSOs)’ include all non-state, not-for-profit
structures, such as citizens’ associations, patient groups, professional societies
or groups, consumer groups, humanitarian organisations, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs), foundations and charities.
• ‘End-users’ are public, private or civil (i.e. civil society, see above) organisations
that constitute potential users of the R&I outputs.
• ‘Engagement’ means the involvement of citizens and civil society in co-designing
R&I agendas, in co-creating R&I contents, and/or in co-assessing R&I outcomes.

What is innovation procurement and how is it relevant for Horizon Europe?
Innovation procurement happens when public procurement is used to drive innovation
from the demand side. This enables the public sector to speed up the development and
adoption of innovative solutions that can improve the quality and efficiency of public
services or address wider societal challenges while opening concrete business
opportunities for companies in Europe to bring innovations to the market.
Innovation procurement is therefore a topic of cross-cutting importance for all
pillars of the Horizon Europe programme:
• Under the Excellence Science pillar, innovation procurement can help increase
the EU’s global scientific competitiveness in the field of research infrastructures.
In the field of supercomputing for example, innovation procurement actions
financed under FP7 and Horizon 2020 have paved the way for stronger European
cooperation and competitiveness through the joint undertaking for High
Performance Computing (HPC).
• Under the Global Challenges and European Industrial Competiveness pillar
innovation procurement can trigger new research and development (R&D) and
deployment of innovative solutions to address societal challenges (e.g. in health,
security, energy, environment, transport…) and reinforce technological and
industrial capacities. For EU-missions, innovation procurement can also play a
key role to bring to the market solutions that can tackle big problems. This
online brochure bundles examples of innovation procurement funded by the EU
research and innovation programme that successfully tackled societal challenges
in several sectors.
• Under the Innovative Europe pillar, innovation procurement links to SME support
via the European Innovation Council.
Finally, innovation procurement is also central to the European Defence Fund and may
also be used in the context of the Euratom Programme.
What is the strategic importance for Europe?
Benchmarking shows that in Europe investments on innovation procurement are 2
times lower compared to other leading global economies. Underinvestment is the
biggest in R&D procurement (5 times lower) and in adoption of ICT based solutions (3
times lower). As innovation procurement is crucial for public sector modernisation and
56EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
business growth, mainstreaming innovation procurement is of strategic
importance to strenghten Europe’s global competitiveness. By closing the gap
between supply and demand in a way that reinforces EU strategic autonomy, innovation
procurement can make a key contribution to economic recovery25. It can increase
resilience in the supply chain by opening up opportunities for innovative companies,
including also SMEs and Startups, to access the public procurement market, attract
financial investment and scale up their business.
How does Horizon Europe support innovation procurement?
Horizon Europe provides EU funding to start innovation procurement. A key difference
to other research and innovation actions is that funding for innovation procurement is
not targeted at potential ‘providers’ but at potential ‘buyers’ of innovative solutions:
public procurers, possibly in cooperation with private and NGO buyers.
Two complementary types of innovation procurement are supported:
• Public Procurement of Innovative solutions (PPI) can be used by procurers
when challenges of public interest can be addressed by innovative solutions that
are nearly or already in small quantities on the market. PPI can thus be used
when there is no need for procurement of new R&D to bring solutions to the
market, but as a clear signal from a sizeable amount of early adopters/launch
customers that they are willing to purchase/deploy the innovative solutions if
those can be delivered with the desired quality and price by a specific moment in
time. PPI may still involve conformance testing before deployment.
• Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) can be used by procurers when there
are no near-to-the-market solutions that meet all the procurers' requirements
and new R&D is needed to get new solutions developed and tested to address
the procurement need. PCP can then compare the pros and cons of alternative
approaches to address the challenge and eliminate risk from promising
innovations step-by-step via solution design, prototyping, development and first
product testing. PCP is a public procurement of R&D services that does not
include the deployment of commercial volumes of end-products (see PPI for the
latter).
In several areas, there is a need for European cross-border cooperation on innovation
procurement to address challenges that require cross-border interoperability or
interconnection, to pool resources for problems that cannot be financed from only
national funding, to obtain higher quality and lower cost solutions and to reduce
fragmentation of demand so that companies can sell their solutions to a wide European
market.
Therefore, Horizon Europe provides different types of support for buyers from
different countries that want to collaborate together on innovation procurement:
• Coordination and Support actions (CSA) support coordination and
networking activities for groups of procurers to investigate the feasibility and/or
prepare the ground for concrete future innovation procurement. CSA grants do
not provide EU co-financing for a procurement action.
• PCP or PPI actions co-finance both the procurement cost for groups of
procurers to buy the research, development, validation and possible first
25 Impacts of EU funded PCP show 20%-30% efficiency and quality improvements in public services,
doubling of the amount of public procurement directly awarded to startups/SMEs, a factor 20 increase in
the amount of cross-border contract award to startups/SMEs and a factor 4 additional financing secured
by startups/SMEs. The use of place of performance and IPR/commercialisation conditions that fuel
commercialisation in Europe, also contributes to EU strategic autonomy.
57EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
deployment (PCP) or wider scale deployment (PPI) of innovative solutions as well
as additional related costs to prepare, manage and follow up such procurement.
A minimum of two public procurers from two different EU Member States or
associated countries are required in the buyers’ group. One of them will act as
lead procurer to coordinate and lead one joint PCP or PPI action or several
separate but coordinated PPI actions for the buyers’ group. In addition other
procurers, e.g. private procurers or NGO procurers, can be part of the buyers’
group. Both in PCP actions, PPI actions and CSAs that prepare PCP or PPI
procurements, other entities (e.g. experts, certification bodies) can also
participate in the additional activities of the action, except entities that are
potential suppliers of solutions for the procurement action or have another
potential conflict of interest with the procurement action. In total there must be
minimum three participants from three different Member States or countries
associated to Horizon Europe in the action. Entities formed by several public
procurers from different countries can also apply for this type of funding (e.g.
European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation- EGTCs, European Research
Infrastructure Consortia – ERICs, Central Purchasing Bodies, etc).
For more information about the CSA and PCP and PPI action instruments, refer to
General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme.
The EU itself can also implement innovation procurement from the Horizon Europe
budget, either alone or together with public buyers from Member States. An example
funded by Horizon Europe is the EU blockchain PCP implemented by the European
Commission.
It is also possible for one single buyer to implement PCP and PPI actions on its own,
under the subcontracting activities of a regular research and innovation grant.
Examples of projects and achievable impacts?
Examples of ongoing PCP and PPI projects funded by previous FP7 and CIP programs
can be found here. Showcase success stories are bundled here. More information about
the impacts achieved by past projects is also available here.

innovation procurement, you can search all calls on the Funding and Tenders portal via
the keywords ‘innovation/innovative procurement’, ‘PCP’, ‘PPI’.

58EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Public procurers are organisations that are contracting authorities or contracting
entities according to the definition of those terms in the EU Public Procurement
Directives 2014/24/EU, 2004/25/EU, 2009/81/EC.
‘Contracting authority’ means the State, regional or local authorities, bodies
governed by public law, associations formed by one or several of such authorities or
one or several of such bodies governed by public law (for the full definition, see Article
2(1)(1) of Directive 2014/24/EU). Bodies governed by public law also include entities
financed mostly by the State, regional or local authorities, or other bodies governed by
public law and entities controlled by those bodies (for the full definition, see Article
2(1)(4) of Directive 2014/24/EU). This includes for example ministries, regions, cities,
road management authorities, public hospitals, central purchasing bodies etc.
‘Contracting entities’ refers to entities operating in specific sectors (such as utilities
for water, energy, transport, postal services covered by Directive 2014/25/EU and
contracting entities in the field of security covered by Directive 2009/81/EC). They may
be contracting authorities, public undertakings or entities operating on the basis of
special or exclusive rights (for the full definition, see Article 4 of Directive 2014/25/EU).
Under Horizon Europe, public procurers also include entities that are contracting
authorities/entities according to the above definition but to which the EU Public
Procurement Directives itself do not apply (e.g. international organisations such as
ERICs - European Research Infrastructure Consortia).

Due diligence is required regarding the trustworthiness of all artificial intelligence-based
systems or techniques used or developed in projects funded under the Horizon Europe
Programme. Wherever appropriate, AI-based systems or techniques must be developed
in a safe, secure and responsible manner, with a clear identification of and preventative
approach to risks.
To a degree matching the type of research being proposed (from basic to
precompetitive) and as appropriate, AI-based systems or techniques should be, or be
developed to become (implicitly or explicitly contributing to one or several of the
following objectives):
• technically robust, accurate and reproducible, and able to deal with and inform
about possible failures, inaccuracies and errors, proportionate to the assessed
risk posed by the AI-based system or technique
• socially robust, in that they duly consider the context and environment in which
they operate
• reliable and to function as intended, minimising unintentional and unexpected
harm, preventing unacceptable harm and safeguarding the physical and mental
integrity of humans

1. Introduction
In order to receive EU funding/tenders (i.e. grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc), applicants need to fulfill a certain number of conditions
which must be checked before any funding can be awarded to them.
Some of these checks are done centrally by the EU Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register, set up in accordance with
Articles 128 and 147 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/10461 as central repository
and electronic data interchange area for participants.
This guidance sets out the rules that the Central Validation Service will use for these
checks. They currently cover:
− legal entity validation (also called ‘PIC validation’)
− LEAR appointment
− collecting the financial information for the financial capacity assessment (also
called ‘FCA’)
− ownership control assessment (also called ‘OCA’).
For these checks, the participants will be contacted directly by the Central Validation
Service and asked to submit the necessary information and supporting documents via
the Participant Register. This happens normally during preparation of the first grant,
procurement, prize or contribution agreement that successfully passed the evaluation
stage, but can also occur later during subsequent applications or in case of changes.
All data and documents will be treated as confidential.
Personal data will be handled in accordance with Regulation 2018/17252 to ensure
compliance with the principles of transparency, proportionality, impartiality and
legality. For the details, please refer to the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy
Statement (available on Portal > Legal Notices).
2. Legal entity validation
2.1. Legal entity validation and specific legal statuses: Criteria and
conditions
One of the main tasks of the Central Validation Service is the validation of new legal
entities applying for EU grants, procurements, prizes and contribution agreements.
Legal entity validation is a requirement under the Financial Regulation. It serves to
ensure that only verified entities can enter into financial relations with the EU and to
avoid legally invalid contracts.
Legal entity validation is needed only once, to get the legal entity information and

the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No

45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
participant identification code (PIC) validated. Once validated, the participants can
enter into financial relations with the EU and use the PIC for all EU actions managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. The PIC will be valid for all ongoing application
procedures and signature in the system, but also for any type of EU funding in the
future — without having to re-register or be re-validated.
This is why the standards for PIC validation are applied consistently, independently of
the specific call/application/tender procedure that triggers the validation. The same
criteria and checks are applied for grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc, as well as for low and high value contracts.
The validation comprises two distinct actions: (a) the verification that the participant
exists as legal entity capable of entering into financial relations with the EU, including
correctness of the participant’s legal data (legal form, address, etc) and (b) the
verification of certain specific legal statuses that are used in EU funding programmes
and recorded centrally in the Participant Register.
2.1.1 Legal entity validation
‘Legal entity’ means a natural person or an entity created and recognised by law as a
legal person. It must have legal personality and, acting on its own account and in its
own name, be able to exercise rights and be subject to obligations.
Specific cases
❖ Natural persons (including self-employed persons; see below) — Are by default
considered as being legal entities. However, the Central Validation Service will refuse
validation of persons that cannot legally enter into contractual relations with the EU
(e.g. persons under age).
❖ Branches — Are not regarded as legal entities, since they do not have legal
personality distinct from that of their mother-company. The fact that they are
registered in national official registers is not relevant. It will be their mother-company
that will be considered as legal entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in
the Participant Register. The same applies to branches established in a different
country or branches of entities such as non-profit organisations, NGOs, etc.
❖ Foreign companies (company establishments which are registered with a special
status in the official register, e.g. ‘société de droit étranger’) — Will not be regarded
as legal entities, since they do not have legal personality distinct from that of their
mother-company. It will be their mother-company that will be considered as legal
entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register (the
one registered in the country of incorporation).
❖ Entities set-up within (or under) a parent organisation (such as
departments/centers/offices, without legal personality, despite having administrative
or budgetary autonomy, own VAT number/fiscal code/number of registration, etc) —
Cannot be regarded as legal entities and are considered as belonging to their parent-
organisation. It will be their parent organisation that will be considered as legal entity
for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register.
2.1.2 Exception: Validation of private entities without legal personality
By way of exception, the Financial Regulation allows for certain ‘entities without legal
personality’ to be eligible for EU grants. Such entities can therefore be validated in
the Participant Register, provided they meet the conditions set out in Article
197(2)(c) of this Regulation:
7EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on behalf
of the entity
and
− the entity offers equivalent guarantees for the protection of the EU financial
interests as a legal person, in particular equivalent financial and operational
capacity (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
This exception aims at private entities, i.e. associations or similar entities with
permanent structures (secretariat, management board, assembly, etc.) that have
their own activities, but just lack formal legal personality.
Concerning the first condition, the entity must prove its representatives' capacity to
undertake legal obligations on its behalf. This condition is not met when the
obligations are assumed on behalf of the representatives themselves or on behalf of
the owner(s) of the entity.
Concerning the second condition, the entity must prove the following elements:
− existence of patrimony/assets/capital separated and different from those of its
members/owners
and
− rules ensuring that creditors can rely on such patrimony/assets/capital and
that, in case of liquidation/insolvency, creditors are reimbursed prior to the
repartition of the patrimony/assets/capital among the owners/members (—
both conditions must be fulfilled and proved by supporting documents).
This exception only applies for participation in EU grants; entities without legal
personality cannot participate in EU tenders.
2.1.3 Exception: Validation of ministries, specialised entities of IOs and
certain EU bodies
By way of exception, the Central Validation Service will also accept the following
public entities without legal personality to be validated in the Participant Register:
− the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) (explicitly declared eligible by Articles
176(2) and 197(4) of the Financial Regulation)
− ministries, executive services which are part of the public administration of a
(central or federated) State and directly linked to the government and other
services which are part of the legislative or judicial administration, in
accordance with the official organisation of the State
− assimilated international organisations referred to in Article 156(2) of the
Financial Regulation
− specialised entities set up by international organisations, that lack legal
personality
− Common Foreign Security Policy (CFSP) missions and EU special
representatives set up by the Council of the European Union.
Departments/directorates/units/offices and other entities set up within a Ministry (or
within an executive or other service) without legal personality are considered as part
of the same Ministry (or service) and cannot be considered as independent legal
8EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
entities (e.g. schools, libraries, etc). They will have to use the PIC of their parent
organisation to participate in EU grants, procurements, prizes, etc.
2.1.4 Specific legal statuses
In addition, the validation covers the following specific legal statuses that are used in
certain EU funding programmes:
− private entity or public body
− non-profit or for profit organisation
− small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
− middle-capitalisation enterprise (mid-cap)
− non-governmental organisation (NGO)
− civil society organisation (CSO)
− international organisation (IO)
− research organisation
− secondary or higher education establishment.
An entity may be categorised in more than one of these legal statuses (i.e. non-profit,
public body, research organisation, international organisation, etc.).
The practical relevance of these statuses (and what happens if they change) is
established at the level of the different funding programmes, and sometimes even at
the level of the call for proposals/call for tender.
Moreover, not all of these statuses are systematically checked and validated by the
Central Validation Service. Some of them are self-declarations or self-assessments.
This means that the participants are solely responsible for the correctness of the
information they provide (in the self-declaration/self-assessment).
The Central Validation Service may however — at any time — carry out checks on
self-declared/self-assessed statuses against supporting documents and ask for
clarifications.
In case of false declarations, the EU services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status(es)
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements,
etc.; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
Private entity or public body
'Private entity' means an entity established under private law.
‘Public body’ means an entity established as a public body by national law, or an
9EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
international organisation.
‘Established as a public body by national law’ means:
− incorporated as a public body in the act of creation or recognised as a public
body by national law
and
− governed by public law (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
Criteria such as:
− mission or activity in the general interest (public service mission)
− the fact that the shares are owned by a public body (even if ownership reaches
up to 100% of the share capital)
− public financing
− state supervision and control
do NOT constitute sufficient evidence to qualify an entity as a public body, if the
above two conditions are not met.
Public bodies may however act and be subject to private law for some or most of their
activities, provided that, concerning their existence and their functioning, they are
subject to public law.
The two statuses (private entity and public body) are mutually exclusive, meaning
that you can only be validated as one or the other.
They are systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the
Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Self-employed persons (persons who perform an activity independently and with
their own means, such as craftsmen and individuals exercising liberal, industrial and
commercial professions) — Are regarded as ‘natural persons’, not as ‘private entities’;
the business/profession/activity they perform is not provided with independent legal
personality different from that of the person.
❖ Private law bodies with a public service mission3 — A legal entity
incorporated under private law/private legal form is not considered to be a public
body even if owned by the State/other public bodies and/or pursuing a public service
mission.
Non-profit
‘Non-profit entity’ means an entity that is non-profit making by its legal form or legal
purpose (e.g. charitable organisations), or that has a legal or statutory obligation not
to distribute profits to its shareholders or members.
All profits have to be reinvested in the same activity of the entity.
3 Article 62(1)(c)(vi) of Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
10EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Decisions on (not) distributing profits made by the managing board, associates,
stakeholders, members, or representatives and/or practices adopted by the entity to
not distribute profits and/or the absence of profits achieved are not sufficient proof of
the non-profit nature. The obligation not to distribute profits and/or the impossibility
to distribute profits must be based on law and/or the act of establishment/articles of
association/statutes, etc.
Whether the owners/founders of the entity are non-profit and whether the profits are
allocated to non-profit (or for profit) entities is irrelevant.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Public bodies — Are in principle regarded as non-profit by default.
❖ Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) — The classification as ‘non-
governmental organisation (NGO)’ is not relevant for the non-profit status, since in
most countries NGO is not a recognized legal form. By contrast, non-profit status is a
prerequisite for the self-declaration as NGO (see below).
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
‘Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)’ means a micro, small or medium-sized
enterprise as defined in the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361, i.e.:
− engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form (including, in
particular, self-employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or
other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an
economic activity)
and
− employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as
defined in Article 5 of the SME Recommendation) and which have an annual
turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and/or an annual balance sheet total
not exceeding EUR 43 million.4
An entity is considered to be engaged in an ‘economic activity’, if it proves to be
involved in any form of trade or activity done for remuneration or pecuniary interest
on the market. Thus, in general, any activity consisting in (directly or indirectly)
offering goods or services on a given market is an economic activity.
The following will NOT be considered economic activities:
− activities which do not entail (directly or indirectly) some sort of pecuniary
offset or
− activities for which there is no given/direct (or indirect) market or
− activities for which the income generated is not distinct from the personal
income of the entity’s members or shareholders.
4 The SME ceilings must be calculated by including the headcount of staff, the balance sheet total and the
turnover data of all relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361.
11EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
This status is self-declared. For calls where the SME status has an impact on eligibility
or funding (higher funding rate, etc), participants must go through a self-assessment
wizard.
Two-year rule — In accordance with Article 4.2 of the SME Recommendation, the SME
status depends on the ceilings for two consecutive accounting periods. Headcount and
turnover must stay below the ceilings for two accounting periods to obtain the SME
status; conversely, the status will be lost if they rise above the ceilings for two
consecutive periods.
Since the SME self-assessment looks at the information for only one accounting
period (the last one), the SME self-assessment result may be flawed. Participants that
were below the ceiling the year before, must contact the Central Validation Service
via the Participant Register in order to request a formal validation. This validation will
then take into account the two accounting periods.
The two-year rule does not apply for changes due to a merger or acquisition.
Enterprises that are subject to a change in ownership need to be assessed on the
basis of their shareholder structure at the time of the transaction. If the aggregated
headcount and financial data of the new structure exceed the SME ceilings, the SME
status is lost immediately from the date of the transaction5.
Participants whose SME status changes after registration must update their data in
the Participant Register. This is important not only for eligibility checks in grant
applications, but also for statistical purposes.
Specific cases
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that do not yet have
closed accounts or companies without economic activity but expecting to enter
soon into the market — May also qualify as SMEs, as long as they are able to provide
a ‘bona fide estimate’ (in the form of a business plan) covering the period necessary
for the entity to generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long time-to market
— Are allowed to demonstrate that they are engaged in an economic activity by
showing the investments made and the likely expected return.
Middle-capitalisation enterprise (Mid-cap)
'Middle-capitalisation enterprise’ means an enterprise that is:
− not a micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under the EU SME
Recommendation 2003/361
and
− employing up to 3 000 persons6 , where the headcount of staff, including all
relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises, is calculated in
accordance with Article 3 to 6 of the Annex to the Recommendation.
This status is self-declared. For calls where the mid-cap status has an impact on
eligibility or funding (higher funding rate, etc.), participants must go through the SME
5 See Recital 9 of Recommendation No, 2003/361/EC and the User Guide to the SME Definition (p. 14).

self-assessment wizard to make sure that they do not fall under the definition of SME,
and then to self-declare that the number of employees does not exceed 3 000
persons.
Non-governmental organisation (NGO)
‘Non-governmental organisations’ are organisations which are voluntary, independent
from government and non-profit, and which are not a political party or trade union.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by private entities,
which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Civil society organisation (CSO)
‘Civil society organisations’ are organisations from the ‘third sector’ of society, distinct
from government and business (i.e. private for profit entities).
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will normally be accepted only by private
entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
International organisation (IO)
‘International organisation’ means an intergovernmental organisation (other than the
EU) established under international public law, including specialised entities — with or
without legal personality — set up by international organisations.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
For some EU funding programmes there are moreover specific subtypes of
international organisations:
− ‘international organisations of European interest for H2020 (H2020 IOEI)’, i.e.
international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member
States or H2020 associated countries and whose main objective is promoting
scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international European research organisations for Horizon Europe (HE IERO)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries and whose main
objective is promoting scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international organisations of European interest for Digital Europe (DEP IOEI)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or whose headquarters are in an EU Member State.
The H2020 IOEI subtype status is systematically checked against supporting
documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.
The HE IERO and DEP IOEI subtype statuses are self-declared. In the future, for calls
where the HE IERO and DEP IOEI statuses have an impact on eligibility or funding,
participants will also be asked to go through a self-assessment wizard.
Specific cases
❖ Entities set up as distinct bodies by an international organisation with a
special mission but which do not have explicit legal personality — Can be validated
as with legal personality, if they meet any of the following criteria:
− they have treaty-making capacity or
13EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− they have capacity to act at international level independently from the
organisation that set them up (i.e. capacity to undertake legal obligations).
If such entities do not meet one of the above criteria, they can exceptionally be
validated as without legal personality (see section 2.1.3 above).
Research organisation
‘Research organisation’ means an entity that:
− is established as non-profit organisation as described above
and
− carries out research and/or technological development as its main objective.
The following are NOT considered research activities:
− supporting or financing research activities carried out by other entities
− promoting, managing or coordinating research activities.
Only entities that have research and/or development as their main objective can
qualify as research organisations. By contrast, entities that have research and/or
development as ancillary activities (even if regular and substantial, e.g. in museums
or hospitals) do not qualify as ‘research organisations’.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by entities, which
have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Secondary or higher education establishment
‘Secondary or higher education establishment’ means an entity that is recognised as
such by its national education system and is able to deliver diplomas recognised by
the State.
It can be a public body or a private entity (see above). The national accreditation as a
secondary/higher education establishment is not sufficient to consider the entity as a
public body.
This status is self-declared.
2.2 Documents and information to provide
2.2.1 General requirements and principles
The legal validation of entities is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participants as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
by the participants on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (can be
required by the EU services at any time).
In principle only official documents are accepted. Documents are considered as official
when they are delivered by official national authorities. Official documents can NOT be
replaced by self-declarations or by sworn or solemn statements before judicial or
administrative authorities, notaries or public officers.
As a general rule, documents are accepted in any of the EU official languages.
Participants may however be requested to submit an English free (unofficial)
translation to facilitate the validation process. Documents in non-EU languages will be
accepted only if accompanied by a free translation in English (and in case of doubt, a
14EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
certified/legal translation in English may be requested). Free translations should
always be accompanied by the copies of the original official documents.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as for any information provided by other means
(e.g. by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
2.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Signed legal entity identification form7:
− Natural Person Form: in English
− Private Legal Entity Form: in English
− Public Legal Entity Form: in English.
2. Official VAT document or — if the entity is not registered for VAT — the proof of
VAT exemption, not older than one (1) year.
For the specific legal statuses, participants will be asked to submit the following
additional documents:
Status Documents to be submitted
Private entity A valid registration extract not older than one (1) year.
Documents older than one year may be accepted if valid for a
(including SME and mid-cap)
certain period of time expressly indicated in the same
document (e.g. valid for two years) and if submitted via the
Participant Register within this period of time.
Public body Copy of the act, law, decree or decision that established the
entity as a public body (or, if this does not exist, any other
official legal document that proves this).
Natural person Integral copy (legible) of valid identity card or passport (e.g. in
case of identity card, both sides must be provided).

Entities without legal personality Copy of an official document attesting that the representatives
of the entity have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on
its behalf.
Copy of an official document attesting that the entity has the
same operational and financial viability as that of a legal entity:
i.e.
1. a document showing patrimony/assets/capital that
are separated and different from those of the
members/owners of the entity, and
2. a copy of the rules providing that creditors can rely
on this patrimony/assets/capital and — in case of
liquidation/insolvency — are reimbursed before the
patrimony/assets/capital are divided between the
owners/members.
Non-profit Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is non-
profit by its legal form or by its legal purpose, or that it has a
legal or statutory obligation not to distribute profits to
shareholders or individual members.
The certificate of tax exemption is only an indication of the
non-profit status and will therefore be assessed together with
other elements.
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME) The following documents must be provided for the participant
and mid-caps and for its linked and partner entities (in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation
(— if expressly requested by the Central
2003/361):
Validation Service)
1. graph showing the complete ownership structure,
including all direct and indirect shareholders
2. proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners
and their respective percentage of interest and voting
rights
3. approved financial statements for the most recent
closed accounting period, including:
− balance sheet statement
− profit and loss account, clearly indicating the
amount of annual turnover from sales of goods
and services
− annexes to these documents and/or
accompanying notes, indicating (i) staff head
count and (ii) any equity participations in other
companies/downstream organisations with
exact percentage of the shares and voting rights
held. If the annexes/notes to the financial
statements do not contain the requested
information, other documents can be provided
that contain equivalent data (such as headcount
reports for social security purposes, extracts from
HR records certifying headcount, etc); in
exceptional cases, self-declarations can be
accepted
4. documents explaining the mechanisms of ownership
and control, corporate governance and decision-
making rules (e.g. statutes/articles of association and
shareholders’ agreements; memorandum of

understanding among shareholders, internal corporate
governance rules, etc)
Sworn or solemn statements before a judicial or
administrative authority, notary or public officer cannot replace
the above listed documents as proof of the SME or mid-cap
status.
The following documents must be submitted in the below
specific cases:
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that
do not yet have closed accounts — Instead of approved
financial statements, a self-declaration must be provided,
including a bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan)
for the entire period (financial years) necessary for the entity to
generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long
time-to market — In addition to the approved financial
statements, a self-declaration must be provided, including a
bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan) for the
entire period (financial years) necessary to generate turnover,
including a declaration of the investment made and the likely
expected return (to demonstrate that, despite the lack of
turnover, the enterprise is engaged in an economic activity).
❖ Entities owned directly or indirectly by natural persons —
Self-declaration on the natural person(s) engagement in
economic activity and possible participations in other entities
must be provided. The template for the self-declaration will be
provided to participants during the validation process if specific
cases of ownership by natural persons are identified.
International organisation Copy of the international treaty creating the organisation under
international public law.
Research organisation Copy of an official document attesting research or technological
development as the main objective of the entity.
(— if expressly requested by the Central
Validation Service)
Secondary or higher education Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is
establishment recognised as ‘secondary or higher education establishment’ by
the national education system and is entitled to deliver
(— if expressly requested by the Central
diplomas recognized by the State.
Validation Service)
For other categories such as NGO, Civil Society Organisation, etc no supporting
documents are needed (unless exceptionally requested by the Central Validation
Service).
2.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
17EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− the documents submitted are outdated (e.g. VAT document or extract of
registration no longer valid or more than one (1) year old)
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the validation (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
2.3 Validation and effective date
On the basis of the submitted information and documents, the participant will be
validated with the effective date of entry into force of the legal act establishing its
constitution or incorporation (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
That date will be, in order of precedence:
1. the date of registration in the country's’official registry (e.g. commercial
registry)
2. the date of publication in the national official journal
3. the date of the legal deposit of the act in the court registry
4. the date of signature of the parties.
When there is no act of constitution or incorporation, the participant will be
considered to exist since a standard default date.
The effective date for the SME and mid-cap status will be the accounts closure date of
the accounting period on which the assessment is based in accordance with Article
4(2) of the Annex of the SME Recommendation 2003/361. For newly established
enterprises that do not yet have closed accounts, the effective date is the date of
their creation.
The effective date of other specific legal statuses is the date in which the specific
status enters into force. This date may be the same as its effective date of
constitution or incorporation (or may differ, if the specific status has been acquired
later on).
2.4 Modification of validations
Modifications in the validation can be made in the following cases:
− following a request submitted by the participant to update the validation (e.g.
in case of changes in the participant’s legal situation such as change of
identity/legal form, name, address, status) or
− after checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out by the EU services
which necessitate a correction.
2.4.1 Validation updates
In case of a change in the participant’s legal situation (identity/legal form, name,
address, status, etc), the participant must request an update of the validation.
18EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Requests to update a validation will be accepted, if submitted by the participant’s
LEAR and accompanied by the relevant supporting documents. If no LEAR has
been appointed yet in the Participant Register, requests for modification should be
submitted after the LEAR appointment has been validated.
The ‘effective date of the change’ will be the date on which the act establishing the
change enters into force (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
For SMEs and mid-caps, the effective date is the closure date of the accounting period
on which the change of status is based. For cases of mergers and acquisitions that
lead to the loss of the SME or mid-cap status, the effective date of change will be the
date when the ownership structure changed.
The impact and practical consequences of the changes depend on each funding
programme.
2.4.2 Corrections of validations
If a validation turns out to beincorrect (through an audit, ex-post check, investigation
or other means), it will be corrected by the Central Validation Service. The correction
will be registered with effect back to the effective date of the initial validation.
If the error is attributable to the Central Validation Service and its correction implies
disadvantages for the participant, the retroactive effect may exceptionally be waived,
if duly justified and in line with the principles of sound financial management and
proportionality.
If the error was the fault of the participant (intentional or unintentional), its
participation in on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc
may be terminated and undue amounts paid may be recovered. Moreover, the
participant may be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements,
prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial
Regulation). In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
2.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If they find out that a participant did not meet the criteria for being validated or for
being validated with a specific legal status (e.g. due to false declarations), the
modification of the validation will be registered with retroactive effect back to the
effective date of the validation.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc, their participation may be terminated/withdrawn and
undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.

3. Validation of the LEAR appointment
3.1 Validation of the LEAR appointment: General requirements and principles
In parallel with the legal entity validation, the Central Validation Service will contact
the participants to appoint their Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR), i.e.
the single point of contact needed for the Participant Register and Funding & Tenders
Portal electronic exchange system.
The appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register is mandatory for all
validated participants. Without LEAR it will NOT be possible to update the legal entity
data in the Participant Register, nor sign contracts electronically in the Funding &
Tenders Portal.
3.1.1 Role of the LEAR
The LEAR is the person officially appointed by the participant to handle their access
rights and key data in the Participant Register (legal and other data, certain access
rights in the electronic exchange system, etc.).
Once validated, it is the LEAR who is responsible for giving access rights to the Portal
electronic exchange system and who must ensure that the participant’s legal
information is always up to date.
The LEAR must enter and update on the ‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen the names
of the:
− legal representatives and signatories for the organisation (so-called ‘LSIGNs’);
these are people who are able to commit the organisation legally by signing
contracts and authorising amendments to them and
− persons that may sign cost statements on behalf of the organisation (so-called
‘FSIGNs’).
If needed, the LEARs can delegate their tasks to one or more colleagues, who will act
as account administrators (so-called ‘AccAds’; delegation also through the
‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen).
In case of changes, the LEAR must encode the change in the Participant Register and,
if needed, request validation and provide supporting documents.
For a detailed description of the LEAR rights and responsibilities, see the LEAR
appointment letter*.
3.1.2 Position of the LEAR
The LEAR is an administrative function that may be held by the participant’s legal
representative or another key person within the entity.
The LEAR must be someone employed in the entity (most commonly in the central
administrative services of the entity) and should be able to ensure the stability and
continuity that is needed to fulfil this role in order to honour the participant’s
contractual obligations.
Participants that are natural persons will automatically have the role of LEAR; in this
case the role cannot be attributed to a different person (but the LEAR can appoint an
account administrator).
20EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Each participant can only appoint one LEAR and must ensure to immediately replace
their LEAR in case they are no longer able to exercise the role (e.g. job change,
dismissal, death, etc; see section 3.3).
The participant assumes the full responsibility for the choice of the person they
appoint as LEAR.
3.1.3 Legal representative
The LEAR must be appointed by the participant’s legal representative. The legal
representative is a person duly authorised to act on behalf of the entity and to
commit it in its entirety vis-à-vis third parties.
Specific cases
❖ Persons tasked with the daily management — Can not be recognized as legal
representatives if they are not entitled to engage and represent the entity outside
ordinary day-to-day business matters.
The ‘daily management’ (‘gestion journalière’) is commonly understood as comprising
those acts that, because of their minor importance or the need for a prompt solution,
do not justify the intervention of the management bodies. It consists of ordinary
business and execution of day-to-day decisions and in line with the general
instructions of the management board.
❖ Limitations — Similarly, persons empowered to engage and commit the
participant only within certain limits (including financial limits) can not be accepted as
legal representatives for the purposes of the LEAR appointment.
3.1.4 Timing of the LEAR appointment
The process for appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register can run in parallel
to the validation of the entity, but can only be finalised once the participant (PIC) is
validated.
LEAR appointment is not a condition for the submission of a proposal/tender in the
Funding & Tenders Portal, but its validation must be completed before the the grant,
procurement or contribution agreement can be signed.
3.2 List of documents and information
For the validation of the LEAR appointment, the scanned version of the following
documents must be uploaded by the participant in the Participant Register:
1. LEAR appointment letter* (specifying the LEAR roles & duties and including the
declaration of consent to the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and
Conditions*), completed, dated and signed by the legal representative and the
LEAR
2. Integral copy of an official, valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport, with
photo and signature) of:
− the legal representative and
− the appointed representative (LEAR)
3. Document(s) proving that the legal representative(s) appointing the LEAR is
empowered as such, which must:
21EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− clearly indicate the role/function within the organisation as legal
representative
− identify and appoint this person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
The originals must be kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which
can be required by the EU services at any time). They must not be sent to the Central
Validation Service.
After receiving the above-listed documents (and after the PIC has been validated),
the LEAR appointment will be validated in the Participant Register.
For a detailed description of the LEAR appointment process, see the Online Manual*
and the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions*.
Proof of identity
‘Identity documents’ are those issued by national authorities and recognized by
national law as valid proof of identity. Identity documents can not be replaced by any
other means of proof. The EU services cannot waive this requirement under any
circumstances.
Examples of identity documents accepted are ID cards and passports. Driving licenses
are also accepted, as long as they are considered as valid proof of identity under the
applicable national law of the entity concerned.
Identity documents must be valid (not expired) at the time of the LEAR appointment.
An integral copy of the document must be provided (e.g. in most countries both sides
of the identity card must be provided).
Identity documents in which some parts/elements, including the photo, have been
deleted/erased/covered (e.g. with black marker) cannot be accepted.
Specific cases
❖ Service cards and badges issued by the participant — Cannot replace identity
documents (even if the participant is a public body) and therefore cannot be accepted
as proof of identity.
❖ Print-outs from the ID electronic chip — Cannot be accepted either.
Signatures
The LEAR documents must be signed by persons who are legal representatives of the
participant.
The names of both legal representative and LEAR in the LEAR documents must
correspond to those indicated in their official identity documents. LEAR documents
signed with acronyms/nick names/etc that do not correspond to the names indicated
in the identity documents will not be accepted.
Signatures can be either handwritten signatures or qualified electronic signatures
22EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
within the meaning of Article 3(12) of Regulation 910/20148. For the latter, the
Central Validation Service will verify that the signature is based on a valid qualified
certificate and was created by a secure creation device. See here for the list of
accepted trust service providers: eIDAS Dashboard (europa.eu).
Specific cases
❖ Internal requirements (e.g. joint signature of more than one person required to
legally engage the entity, foreseen by law, act of establishment, statutes, internal
rules, etc) — In case of internal requirements, the participant is fully responsible for
ensuring compliance (e.g. through an internal process ensuring that the single
signature on the LEAR documents is made only after all the internal requirements on
joint signature are fulfilled).
❖ Limitations — The Central Validation Service will take into account limitations to
represent the entity only if these limitations are explicitly mentioned in the
documents submitted to prove the empowerment of the legal representative (e.g.
limitation in the excerpts of the company registry).
Documents proving the empowerment of the legal representative
The document(s) proving the empowerment must identify:
− the role/function of legal representative within the entity
− the name and appointment of the person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
This can be found in a single document (in case the official appointment also specifies
the powers/tasks related to the appointment) or in several documents combined (e.g.
the official act of appointment and the organisational document, such as act of
establishment, statutes, articles of association, etc, in which the powers/tasks related
to the role are identified).
The documents must be valid (not expired) at the time when the LEAR is appointed.
The documents proving the appointment of the legal representative are those
required/accepted under the applicable national law of the entity concerned. They
may vary depending on the country, the legal form and status:
− law/decree/official act/official gazette in case of public entities
− copy of the treaty in case of international organisations
− decision of assembly, official documents from the council of administration,
executive committee or directors board, excerpts of the company registry in
case of private entities.
A declaration of honour can be accepted only in exceptional, duly justified cases
where none of the above exists.
Concerning the language of such documents and participant's responsibilities
concerning translations, see section 2.2.1.
8 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on
electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 257,
28.8.2014, p. 73).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Specific cases
❖ Participants who are natural persons — Do not need to prove their
empowerment, but still need to send the supporting documents listed above. The
documents should be signed by the natural person alone. A copy of the ID documents
of the natural person must also be included.
❖ Deputising persons — In case of temporary absence of the legal
representative(s) or their impossibility to sign, other persons empowered to act as
legal representatives (i.e. deputising persons) are accepted as legal representatives
by default. The reason for the temporary absence/impossibility and the legitimation of
the deputy will not be checked by the Central Validation Service and therefore
remains under the full responsibility of the participant (see also above under ‘internal
requirements’).
❖ Ministries — For ministries, Ministers are considered legal representatives by
default and there is no need to provide the legal documents proving their
empowerment.
In addition to the Minister's role, the following roles/functions are considered as legal
representatives by default, without any further verification of the legal documents
proving their empowerment:
− Deputy Minister
− State/General Secretary and their deputies
− Directors of certain specific horizontal sectors/departments/directions, namely
'legal', 'financial','European or international relationships'.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the ministry, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website of the ministry).
Except if otherwise provided in the applicable rules (law/decree/act governing the
organisation of the ministry), other roles such as ‘Director’/‘Had of Department’/‘Head
of Unit’, etc will be considered as having limited tasks and powers (relating only to
the directorate/department/unit’s policies) and, therefore, not entitled to represent
and engage the ministry as a whole.
For Ministers, the ID document can be exceptionally replaced by a badge or service
card (issued by the ministry). This exception applies only to the person of the
‘Minister’ and cannot be extended to other representatives (such as State Secretaries,
Deputy Ministers or Directors/Head of Departments); these persons are not exempted
from the obligation to provide an ID document.
❖ Public bodies and governmental entities — For public bodies and other
state/governmental entities, including executive services at central/regional/local
level, the highest-ranked person (e.g. Director-General, President, Mayor, etc) will be
recognized as legal representative by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the entity, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website).
❖ International organisations — For international organisations, the highest-
ranked person (e.g. Secretary, Secretary-General) will be recognised as legal
representative by default.
24EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the international organisation, the
evidence may also be taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the
organisational chart published on the official website of the international
organisation).
❖ Universities and higher education establishments — For universities and
other higher education establishments (e.g. colleges, institutes, etc), the following
roles/functions are recognised as legal representative by default, without any further
verification of their powers:
− Rector and Vice-Rector
− President and Vice-President
− Chancellor and Vice Chancellor.
In case of faculties with their own legal personality (and thus independently
validated), the Dean and Vice-Dean can also act as legal representatives by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the university/higher education
establishment/faculty, the evidence may also be taken from other appropriate
sources (e.g. the organisational chart published on the official internet-site of the
university/faculty).
3.3 LEAR replacement
A LEAR replacement is equivalent to a new LEAR appointment. For the replacement of
an already validated LEAR, participants must submit the same type of documents and
the Central Validation Service will follow the procedure for the validation of LEAR
appointment (see above).
3.4 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant did not respect the obligation to keep the original
documents or committed other irregularities, appropriate measures will be taken.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, or
contribution agreements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts
paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
4. Financial capacity assessment
4.1 Financial capacity assessment: Criteria and conditions
In addition to the legal entity validation and LEAR appointment, the Central Validation
Service also assists the EU services with the financial capacity assessment (required
by the Financial Regulation for grants and procurements; not needed for prizes or
contribution agreements).

The financial capacity assessment must in principle be done for each new
application/tender (— unless the participant already has a valid financial capacity
assessment performed by the Central Validation Service that is not older than 18
months).
Additional conditions depend on the type of procedure (grant or procurement),
participant and grant amount (e.g. no financial capacity assessment is needed for
public bodies in grant procedures, for Member State organisations, international
organisations, persons in receipt of education support, persons most in need and in
receipt of direct support; for low-value grants and low-value procurements).
Additional exemptions are provided in some programmes for specific situations or
types of participants.
Moreover, the financial capacity may be assessed ad hoc if there are justified grounds
to doubt it, like for example:
− indication of weak/insufficient financial capacity from other sources
− involvement in cases of serious administrative errors or fraud
− pending legal procedures or judicial proceedings for serious administrative
errors or fraud
− attachment order or recovery order for an outstanding amount issued by an
EU body on which the payment is significantly overdue
− substantial findings in EU audits within the last 2 years that put in doubt the
financial capacity.
The financial capacity is assessed on the basis of financial indicators that are in
principle the same for all EU programmes.
The financial capacity assessment is normally done during grant preparation/tender
evaluation but may also be done during implementation. If a participants’ financial
capacity must be assessed, they will be contacted by the Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The role of the Central Validation Service is to prepare the financial capacity
assessment (e.g. to collect and to analyse the financial documents). The final decision
on the financial capacity will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender separately
by the EU service in charge.
4.2 Documents and information to provide
4.2.1 General requirements and principles
The financial assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the EU
services at any time).
As a general rule, financial documents must be provided in their original language(s),
as imposed by the legislation in the participant’s country of registration. For
documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit an English free
(unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in non-EU
languages, a free translation in English is always mandatory and needs to be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
26EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
Some examples of such documents are: dated and signed annual management
reports in English for a company listed on the stock exchange or having international
shareholders or for the purpose of consolidation within a foreign group; dated and
signed extracts from national registers that use English, etc.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as any information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw or correct the financial assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
4.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Profit and loss account — approved by the management of the entity, clearly
indicating the amounts of turnover from sales of goods and services, operating
income, staff, depreciation, amortization costs, net operating result and
interest expenses. If this information is not indicated in the profit and loss
account or in the explanatory notes it must be provided in the form of a self-
declaration.
2. Balance sheet statement — approved by the management, clearly indicating
the nature and the maturity (i.e. below or above one year) of receivables and
other current assets, grants, provisions and debts. If this information is not
indicated in the balance sheet or in the explanatory notes it must be provided
in the form of a self-declaration.
3. Explanatory notes and/or annexes that form part of the above financial
statements (if available).
4. External audit report or self-declaration
Participants requesting a grant amount of above 750 000 EUR (for action
grants) or above 100 000 EUR (for operating grants) must provide:
− an statutory audit report issued by an approved/certified external
auditor if:
− such a report is available or
− a statutory audit is required under EU or national law
or
27EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− a declaration on the validity of the accounts* (self-declaration), signed
by the legal representative of the entity, which certifies the validity of
the accounts.
The documents provided must cover the last two closed financial years. The most
recent year must have been closed within the last 18 months.
Exceptions are allowed for:
− start-up companies without closed annual accounts which provide
prospective data (business plan) for one year only
− recently created entities which have closed annual accounts for one year
only. These entities will be assessed based on the documents for the sole
closed financial year
A single financial document containing comparative data of the annual accounts of
both years under assessment will be accepted. The same applies to an external audit
report covering the two financial years.
If some (or all) of the documents have already been provided for the financial years
in question (i.e. uploaded in the Participant Register), the participant does not need
to submit them again.
The audit report must include:
− the clear mandate and scope of the audit
− the responsibilities of the management and the auditor
− the way in which the audit is carried out
− the auditor’s opinion, including a reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
All documents must be provided simultaneously (profit and loss account, balance
sheet, audit report/self-declaration, etc).
No audit report/self-declaration is needed for entities participating in tender
procedures, for natural persons and entities without closed accounts.
Specific cases
❖ Subsidiaries without own financial statements — Subsidiaries which do not
prepare their own financial statements may provide the consolidated accounts and
the audit report/self-declaration of the parent company/group they belong to under
the following conditions:
− the entity is exempt under national law from statutory audits
− only consolidated statements of the parent company/group the entity belongs
to are available
and
− the parent company assumes joint liability for all the debts of the entity (— all
conditions must be fulfilled).
In such cases, participants will be requested to provide additional documents to prove
these conditions.
28EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
❖ Parent companies — Parent companies which are exempt under national law
from publishing individual (i.e. non-consolidated) financial statements will be
requested to provide a dated and signed by the management simplified summary of
their non-consolidated profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
These simplified accounts must respect either the minimum reporting requirements
set out in the national accounting law or Annexes III, IV, V and VI of Directive
2013/349 (for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings
preceded by letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
If the provided financial information is not sufficiently clear, the Central Validation
Service may contact participants for further clarifications.
❖ Newly established enterprises that have not yet closed accounts — Must
provide estimated financial data (i.e. a business plan or a similar document including
financial projections on current and non-current assets, own capital, current and non-
current liabilities, turnover, operating and financial income and charges).
The financial data must respect either the minimum reporting requirements set out in
the national accounting law or to Annexes III, IV, V and VI of EU Directive 2013/34
(for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings preceded by
letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
❖ Natural persons engaged in an economic activity who do not prepare financial
statements in relation to their business activities — Are requested to provide:
− the annual income tax declaration containing details on the revenues and
expenses from business activity
− a signed declaration of patrimony, including:
− fixed patrimony (e.g. land, tenement, hereditament, medium/long-term
deposits (more than one year), stock options that cannot be exercised
within one year)
− current patrimony (e.g. available cash, savings, short-term deposits
(maximum of one year), stock-options that can be exercised within one
year)
and
− a signed declaration of debts, which must contain all liabilities (with dates and
figures), broken down in short-term debts (of maximum one year) and
medium/long-term debts (of more than one year).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities operating cash-based accounting — If the available financial
documents do not contain a profit and loss account and a balance sheet but are
limited to a cash flow statement and/or do not contain sufficient information10,
9 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual
financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of
undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and
repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19–76).
10 E.g. missing information on the nature of revenues, expenses or equity, nature and liquidity of
receivables and assets, maturity of debts etc.
29EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
declarations signed by the authorised legal representative of the entity may be
accepted, if they provide:
− information on fixed and current assets: buildings, equipment, inventory, cash,
short/long term11 deposits, short/long term receivables, sort/long term
liabilities, grants and equity/sources of funding, etc
− information on revenues and expenses, such as turnover from sales of goods
and services, operating income, staff expenses depreciation/amortisation
costs, interest expenses, etc.
In addition, it is recommended to provide any available evidence supporting the
declared amounts (e.g. bank statements confirming the available balance at
accounting closure date, etc).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities covered by a guarantor — Entities that are covered by a full financial
guarantee of another legal entity (i.e. guarantor) may submit the financial data of the
guarantor, provided that it is a full guarantee (i.e. the guarantor has assumed full
joint liability for all debts). Ad-hoc guarantees (covering, for instance, only the
participation in EU projects) cannot be accepted.
Participants that would like to have the financial capacity of their guarantor
assessed, must first contact the service in charge of their application for approval of
the guarantee. In case of approval, the service in charge will request the Central
Validation Service to proceed with the assessment of the guarantor.
4.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
If the financial documents do not contain sufficient information regarding the nature
and the maturity of the current assets, provisions and liabilities, and such information
is not provided, the financial assessment will be completed by taking the most
prudent approach, e.g. by considering the maturity of the current assets to be after
one year, and of the provisions and liabilities to be within one year.
11 Short term — maximum of one year; long term — more than one year.
30EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The financial assessment is valid for 18 months after the closure date of the most
recent assessed accounting period. If during this period the participant applies for
another grant or tender, the financial documents will not be requested again.
However, if there are justified grounds to doubt the financial capacity, a new
assessment may be triggered even before the end of the 18 months.
4.4 Modification of the assessment
In case of disagreement with the assessment, the participant may contact the Central
Validation Service by sending additional justifications via Participant Register
message. The subject of the message should be clearly labelled as related to the
financial assessment (not PIC validation, LEAR assessment or other).
The Central Validation Service will carry out a re-assessment on the basis of the
additional documents.
4.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant made false declarations, their status may be
changed.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants or procurements, their
participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
5. Ownership control assessment
5.1 Ownership control assessment: Criteria and conditions
For funding programmes which have restricted calls in which only participants which
are directly or indirectly controlled by EU Member States or by nationals of EU
Member States (or by entities or nationals of specified eligible countries) are eligible,
the Central Validation Service will also handle the ownership control assessment
analysis.
The ownership control assessment must in principle be done for each new grant,
procurement or contribution agreement (— unless the participant already has a valid
ownership control assessment in the system performed by the Central Validation
Service that is not older than 18 months).
Moreover, the ownership control may be assessed ad hoc if there are grounds
justifying a new assessment, like for example:
− indication of third country control from other sources
− indication of ownership control changes after the initial assessment.
31EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The ownership control assessment will usually look into both ownership and control
elements, in order to assess whether an entity is EU controlled or non-EU controlled.
The focus is however on control (see Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and
CEF-DIG restricted calls*).
In this context, ‘control’ will be defined as the possibility to exercise decisive influence
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate entities, ‘de jure’ or ‘de facto’.
The fact that no influence is actually exercised is not relevant, as long as the
possibility exists.
Control will be assessed at the level of the ultimate ownership and control line and all
intermediate layers (in case of indirect control), taking into consideration decision-
making mechanisms, corporate governance, shareholders’/members’ rights, etc.
The assessment is based on the information provided by the participant in the
ownership control declaration* (annexed to their application for EU funding or
procurement procedure) and supporting documents to be provided by the participant
during the ownership control assessment procedure.
The role of the Central Validation Service is limited to identifying instances of
possible non-EU-country/entity control (e.g. to collect and to analyse the supporting
documents). The final decision will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender
separately by the EU service in charge, in accordance with the specific programme
rules.If needed, during grant preparation, the EU service in charge may contact
participants about the outcome of the ownership control assessment.
5.2 Documents and information to provide
5.2.1 General requirements and principles
The ownership control assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by
the participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be
kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the
EU services at any time).
As a general rule, ownership control documents must be provided in their original
language. For documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit
an English free (unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in
non-EU languages, a free translation in English is mandatory and must be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
The participant assumes full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as the information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;

see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
5.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Graph visualising the complete ownership structure/chain of control, including
all ownership layers/chain of control until the ultimate owners.
2. Proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners and their respective
percentage of interest and voting rights, for instance commercial registry
extracts, articles of association/incorporation documents/memorandum of
association/company’s shareholders/members/partners book/registry extract,
etc with the exact distribution of shares/voting rights, i.e. name of
shareholders/members/partners and their percentage of interest andvoting
rights, as well as information on their place of establishment (in case of legal
entity) or nationality (in case of natural persons).
3. Statutes, articles of association, shareholders’/partnership agreements,
memorandum of understanding among shareholders, investment agreements
between shareholders and other relevant documents regarding the decision-
making procedures within the legal entity and the related rights of the
shareholders/members/partners.
4. Documents establishing/describing the decision-making bodies, rules regarding
election, appointment, nomination, dismissal and tenure of members, and
decision-making procedures (e.g. articles of association, bylaws, reports on
corporate governance, internal corporate governance rules, minutes of board
meetings, etc).
5. For participants that are listed companies, subsidiaries or controlled by a listed
company: report/minutes of the last three shareholders meetings, together
with the attendance list identifying the present/represented shareholders and
their respective votes.
6. Cooperation agreements with customers or suppliers, when they could confer
control over the participant — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
7. For shareholders/owners that provide financial contributions: supporting
documents (loans, by-laws, etc) that justify the financial contribution;
documents showing the link between the shareholder/owner and the entity
providing the financing — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
8. Information about any other means, process or links that could ultimately
confer control to a non-EU country or non-EU country entity.
9. Copy of ID card(s) or passport(s) indicating the nationality of the ultimate
owner(s).
The same documents and information must be provided for each intermediate
controlling entity, up to the ultimate owners. The supporting documents must
demonstrate the complete ownership structure, including all layers of ownership and
non-controlling entities.
33EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Guarantees for non-EU controlled entities (if allowed by the call conditions and
required by the EU service in charge) are not part of the ownership control
assessment and must therefore be submitted directly to the EU service in charge of
the grant/tender, in accordance with the specific programme rules.
5.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
not to finalise the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and
documents submitted or publicly available).
5.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The ownership control assessment is in principle valid for 18 months. If during this
period the participant applies for another grant or tender and confirms that the
ownership control status has not changed, the supporting documents will not be
requested again.
In this case, the participants will still have to submit the ownership control
declaration with the application, but there will be no check by the Central Validation
Service, unless there are justified grounds to doubt the declaration.
5.4 Modification of the assessment
Changes in the ownership control status need to be communicated to the granting
authority/contracting authority, which will trigger a new assessment by the Central
Validation Service, if needed.
For more information on the ownership control assessment procedure, see the
Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and CEF-DIG restricted calls*.

EU FUNDING & TENDERS PORTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE
1.1 The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is an electronic portal and exchange
system managed by the European Commission and used by itself and several
other EU services (together ‘EU’), for the management of EU funding/tenders (i.e.
grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, experts, etc).
1.2 It is currently open to:
− users applying for or managing EU grants, tenders and prizes
− entities entering into EU contribution agreements
− external experts and audit firms appointed to work for the EU in the
context of EU funding programmes
and allows them to:
− register (in the Participant Register or Expert Data Base) and view and
edit their data
− create, revise and submit proposals for funding and tenders
− prepare and sign contracts
− manage their projects and contracts (e.g. submit deliverables, reports
and payment requests)
− for experts: perform their tasks inside the system (evaluation,
monitoring, etc)
− for external audit firms: perform their tasks inside the system (audit
management).
1.3 These Terms and Conditions govern the relation between the following parties:
− the European Commission (as owner of the Portal)
and
− users
in relation to access and use of the Portal.
For the avoidance of doubt, it does not cover the terms and conditions related to
the grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements or expert contracts that
are managed through the Portal; those are governed by their own legal framework
and contractual arrangements.
1.4 Requesting access to the Portal, accessing the Portal or using the Portal signifies
unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
Users will be requested to agree explicitly to the Terms and Conditions on their first
login to the Portal.
For users acting on behalf of organisations, the legal representatives of the
organisations will also be asked to explicitly agree at the moment they appoint their
LEAR/EXAFs (through the ‘declaration of consent’; see below).
3EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Organisations must provide their LEAR/EXAFs, LSIGNs and FSIGNs with a copy of
these Terms and Conditions.
Users are responsible for regularly verifying the applicable Terms and Conditions.
1.5 These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the
European Commission and users, as regards the conditions for access and use of
the Portal.
2. ACCESS TO THE PORTAL
2.1 Users
2.1.1 Access to the public parts of the Portal is open to all users.
2.1.2 Access to the Portal electronic exchange system (EES) is open only to persons
with an EU Login account.
2.1.3 Access rights to certain information and functions in the EES are restricted to
users with specific roles (which are in turn linked to their functions within their
organisation or in relation to a particular
proposal/project/grant/contract/agreement).
2.1.4 Organisations can access the EES only via individual users employed by or
representing them.
2.2 Means of access to the EES — EU Login user account
2.2.1 Users must obtain an EU Login account in accordance with the applicable
procedures.
Users who already have an EU Login account must use that account.
2.2.2 Users guarantee that the information provided for registration for the account is
accurate and complete.
The European Commission has — at any time — the right to verify the accuracy
and validity of the information.
If this reveals any inaccuracy or invalidity, the European Commission has the right
to close the account and suspend or refuse access.
2.2.3 The means of access (i.e. the user name and password) are strictly personal and
users are responsible for safeguarding their confidentiality and security, and
ensuring their appropriate use.
Users undertake to take all steps to prevent any unauthorised third party from
gaining knowledge and making use thereof.
Users may not transfer or sell their means of access to third parties.
Users must notify the European Commission immediately (via the IT Helpdesk;
see Funding & Tenders Portal Support menu) of the loss, theft, breach of
confidentiality or any risk of misuse of the means of access.
If the European Commission has any reason to suspect that the confidentiality or
security of the means of access has been breached or that the EES is being
misused, it may — without prior notice — suspend or refuse access.

2.4 LEAR appointment
2.4.1 Organisations using the EES for transactions requiring electronic signatures are
required to appoint a LEAR.
2.4.2 Individuals (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons) will automatically have the
role of LEAR (no appointment needed); but they will have to provide the
supporting documents. Organisations can appoint only one LEAR — who can be
replaced if necessary, following the same appointment process.
2.4.3 Organisations warrant that the person appointed as LEAR is duly authorised to
represent them in relation to all LEAR responsibilities.
Organisations are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of the LEAR
responsibilities and to ensure that the LEAR remains at all times duly authorised
to represent them in relation to these responsibilities.
2.4.4 Supporting documents must be provided directly in the system.
2.4.5 Signed originals must be kept on file for controls (which may take place at any
moment and independently of any ongoing grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements or expert contracts).
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to the closure of the EU Login

2.5 Appointment of signatories in the EES — (P)LSIGNs and (P)FSIGNs
2.5.1 The LEAR must appoint one or more LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation.
2.5.2 The LEAR and its organisation warrant that the persons appointed as LSIGNs or
FSIGNs are duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to all LSIGN
or FSIGN responsibilities.
The LEAR and its organisation are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of
the LSIGN and FSIGN responsibilities and to ensure that the LSIGNs and FSIGNs
remain at all times duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to
these responsibilities.
2.5.3 The CoCo or PaCo must appoint the PLSIGNs and PFSIGNs for individual grants
procurements and contribution agreements from the list of LSIGNs and FSIGNs for
their organisation.
2.6 Data updates on the EES roles
2.6.1 The LEAR is responsible for keeping data related to the organisation roles up-to-
date.
2.6.2 The CoCo/PaCo are responsible for keeping data related to the project roles up-to-

addresses/user accounts are deactivated and removed from the organisation- and
project roles.
2.8 General obligation to channel information to the right addressees

them and ensure proper follow-up and correction for the future.

10EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
(c) submit information or materials that infringe third party rights, are
libellous, obscene, threatening or otherwise unlawful.
3.1.4 Users are fully and unconditionally responsible for any use of the Portal (including
misuse of their means of access), and for any detrimental consequences that may
arise directly or indirectly therefrom.
3.1.5 Organisations acknowledge and accept that they are responsible for the actions
and omissions of persons employed by or representing them, acting as users of
the Portal.
3.1.6 Users are liable for — and will indemnify and hold harmless the European
Commission against — any damage that results from:
− changes made to the Portal or
− use of the Portal in a manner that does not correspond with these Terms and
Conditions.
3.2 Required hardware, software and services
3.2.1 Users acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for the choice, purchase
and operation of hardware, software and telecommunication services required to
connect with and to use the Portal.
Such hardware, software and telecommunication services must meet the
minimum requirements, as specified on the Portal (if any).
Users are responsible for the installation and costs of purchasing and licensing
such hardware, software or telecommunication services.
3.2.2 The European Commission is not liable for hardware, software, products and
services of third parties (such as telecommunication equipment, internet
connections, operating systems and internet browsers).
3.3 Electronic notifications and signatures in the EES
3.3.1 Users acknowledge and accept that under these Terms and Conditions and in line
with the EU Financial Regulation1:
(a) data sent or received through the EES enjoys legal presumption of the
integrity of the data and the accuracy of the date and time of sending or
receiving (as indicated by the EES logs)
(b) a document sent or notified through the EES is considered as equivalent
to a paper document, is admissible as evidence in legal proceedings, is
deemed original and enjoys legal presumption of its authenticity and
integrity, provided it does not contain any dynamic features capable of
automatically changing it
(c) electronic signatures made by users through the EES have the
equivalent legal effect of handwritten signatures.
1 See Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18
July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union (OJ L 193,
30.7.2018, p. 1).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
3.3.2 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) any communication or document sent or notified using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper document with a handwritten signature and shall be
admissible as evidence in legal proceedings and constitute sufficient
evidence in legal proceedings
(b) any declaration, contract (or amendment) signed using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper declaration/contract with a handwritten signature and shall
be admissible as evidence in legal proceedings and constitute sufficient
evidence in legal proceedings
(c) they cannot dispute:
(i) the existence or validity of any communication, document,
declaration or contract signed using any type of electronic
signature through the EES or
(ii) the admissibility of any communication, document, declaration or
contract submitted or signed through the EES as evidence in legal
proceedings, solely on the basis that such communication,
document, declaration or contract was submitted electronically
through the EES or signed with an electronic signature.
3.3.3 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) communications in the EES are generally considered to have been made
when they are sent by the sending party (i.e. on the date and time they
are sent through the EES, as indicated by the time logs)
(b) where formal notifications are required, these are considered to have
been made when they are received by the receiving party (i.e. on the
date and time they are accessed in the EES by the receiving party, as
indicated by the time logs); formal notifications that have not been
accessed within 10 calendar days after sending are considered to have
been accessed.
3.3.4 The European Commission registers access and use of the EES.
This access and use log provides evidence that access and use has been made of
EES, unless users can prove the contrary.
3.3.5 Electronic messages, connections, operations on the network and transactions
between the EU and the users shall be proven using the logs and transaction files
kept electronically by the European Commission.
Users accept the evidential value of this data.
This does not prevent the parties from providing other proof, using permitted
legal methods (such as proof on paper).
3.4 Intellectual property rights
3.4.1 The intellectual and industrial property rights and know-how associated with the
Portal belong exclusively to the European Commission and its licensors.
Only the European Commission has the right to correct errors.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
3.4.2 The European Commission grants users a non-transferable, limited, non-exclusive
licence to use the Portal for their own professional purposes (unless access is
suspended or refused).

protection of computer programs (which cannot be contractually denied), users
may not in any way:
(a) modify, translate or adapt the Portal
(b) decompile or disassemble the Portal
(c) copy the Portal (or parts of it)

In case of technical problems affecting the submission of application documents,
the European Commission reserves the right to cancel calls without entitlement to
compensation.
3.6 Suspension and refusal of access
3.6.1 Users acknowledge that the European Commission may refuse access to a user
logging in, if a session is already open on another computer where another user is
using the same means of access (i.e. the same EU Login account name and
password).
3.6.2 Users acknowledge and accept that the European Commission may suspend or
refuse access to the Portal:
(a) in case of suspected or actual breach of these Terms and Conditions
(b) if the information provided for the registration for an EU Login account is
inaccurate or invalid (clause 2.2.2)

(d) in case of fraudulent practices
(e) if the IT systems of the European Commission are being attacked

(h) for preventive, corrective or routine maintenance and
(i) in any other situation where the European Commission considers that
suspension or refusal of access is reasonably required or desirable.

the suspension or refusal of access.
4. MISCELLANEOUS

4.3.1 Users may be held liable for misuse of the Portal under the conditions set out in

other EU service shall be liable for any direct or indirect damage of any kind

savings, or goodwill), except in the event of wilful misconduct.
To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, neither the European
Commission nor any other EU service can be held liable for gross negligence.
Neither the European Commission nor any other EU service are responsible or
liable for any damage in case of force majeure, external cause or any other events
which are not under their reasonable control.
4.4 Interpretation
4.4.1 These Terms and Conditions have been drawn up in English and its provisions will
be interpreted and construed in accordance with applicable law (see clause 4.6)
and their generally accepted meanings in the English language.
Any translation of these Terms and Conditions is for the convenience of the
parties only, and shall not be binding towards any party.
In the event of any inconsistency between the English original and its translation,
the provisions of the English version shall prevail.
4.4.2 For participants that are international organisations, nothing in these Terms and
Conditions shall constitute, be deemed or construed as a waiver or modification of
their privileges or immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or
international law.
14EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.4.3 International organisations that have also concluded a financial framework
partnership agreement with the EU, may moreover rely on the provisions set out
in that framework agreement— provided they do not call into question the lawful
access and use of the Portal in line with the intended purposes set out in the
Terms and Conditions.
4.4.4 If a provision of these Terms and Conditions is or becomes invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, it shall (if possible and insofar as it is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) be replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable clause that reflects
the initial intentions as closely as possible.
If the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision cannot be validly replaced, no
effect is to be given to the clause and it shall be deemed not to be included in
these Terms and Conditions, without affecting or invalidating the remaining
provisions of these Terms and Conditions.
4.5 Changes
4.5.1 The European Commission may, at any time, vary, add to or delete any provision
of these Terms and Conditions.
4.5.2 Users acknowledge and agree that such new terms and conditions enter into force
with their publication on the Portal.
4.5.3 In accordance with clause 1.4, any access to or use of the Portal shall constitute
unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions (in the then-current
version).
4.5.4 Accordingly, users acknowledge and agree that any modification to the Terms and
Conditions shall be deemed accepted by them as from the first time they access
or use the Portal after the date of entry into force of the new Terms and
Conditions.
4.6 Termination
4.6.1 These Terms and Conditions shall be deemed terminated vis-à-vis a user in case:
− the European Commission no longer makes available the Portal or
− of refusal of access pursuant to clause 3.6.
4.6.2 Those clauses that by their nature are expressly or implicitly intended to survive
the termination or expiry of these Terms and Conditions shall so survive, including
but not limited to clauses 2.4.3, 3.3, 3.5, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.7.
4.7 Applicable law and dispute settlement
4.7.1 For issues closely linked to a grant, procurement, prize, contribution agreement or
expert contract managed through the Portal, the applicable law and dispute
settlement forum are that of the legal framework/contractual arrangement
relating to the grant, procurement, prize, contribution agreement or expert
contract.
4.7.2 For issues relating to these Terms and Conditions, the Portal and access or use of
its electronic exchange system (EES), the applicable law shall be EU law,
supplemented if necessary by the law of Belgium.
15EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
For such issues, the General Court — or on appeal the Court of Justice of the
European Union — shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes, if they
cannot be settled amicably.

the general principles governing the law of international organisations and the

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES AND
OTHER PARTICIPANTS
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting
authority for implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance
with all the obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action
under their own responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated
entities or other participants (see Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the
granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the
beneficiaries fails to implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure
that this part is implemented by someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the
maximum grant amount and subject to an amendment; see Article 39). The financial
responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding
the grant for the entire duration of the action. Unit contributions will be eligible only as long
as the beneficiary and the action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see
Article 19)
25 Condition must be specified in the call.
29Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the
implementation of the action (see Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the prefinancing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements
(CFS) (if required; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article
21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority
under the Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their
affiliated entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and
the granting authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies
otherwise, and in particular:
- submit the prefinancing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify
their quality and completeness before passing them on to the granting
authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other
beneficiaries (report on the distribution of payments; if required, see
Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other
beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other
beneficiary or third party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii)
last indent and (iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have
created or which are controlled by or affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains
30Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance with the obligations under the
Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’26 (or similar, such as European research
infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to
one of their members. The coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the
obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-
ordination, to ensure that the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of
recoveries (if any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article
16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked actions, the beneficiaries must have
arrangements with the participants of the other action, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the
consortium is the same, as part of their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of
outputs, common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy
activities, common communication and dissemination activities, sharing of
information, access to background and results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
26 For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy
the criteria for being awarded a grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole
beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the purpose of implementing the action
financed by the grant.”
31Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in
both actions.

[OPTION 2: Not applicable]
9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions to the action
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment,
other goods, works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge) if necessary for the
implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not
charge contributions to the action (no unit contributions) and their costs are considered
entirely covered by the unit contributions paid to the beneficiaries.

- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, prefinancing guarantees are not
needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their
regular internal or external auditors and in accordance with their internal
financial regulations and procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if
those practices are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no
recovery if the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue
amounts from the third party receiving the support (including legal proceedings)
and non-recovery is not due to an error or negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be
conducted taking into account the rules and procedures specifically agreed
between them and the framework agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the
participant’s internal rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment
will be calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into
before the pre-information letter was received and could not reasonably be
terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated
for damage it sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because
the action was not implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the
damage is due to an infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures
or due to a violation of third parties’ rights by the participant or one of its
employees or individual for whom the employees are responsible.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do
purchases, subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance
with their internal rules and procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal
standards, rules and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
35Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the
grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use),
communication, dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems,
rules and procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules
and procedures that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately
inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU,
may moreover — under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the
decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries) — rely on the provisions set out in that framework agreement.

ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
20.1 Keeping records and supporting documents
The beneficiaries must — at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6) —
keep records and other supporting documents to prove the proper implementation of the
action in line with the accepted standards in the respective field (if any).
In addition, the beneficiaries must — for the same period — keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the number of units declared; beneficiaries do not need to
keep specific records on the actual costs incurred.
The records and supporting documents must be made available upon request (see Article 19)
or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).

If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, unit contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
21.1 Continuous reporting
The beneficiaries must report on the progress of the action (e.g. deliverables, milestones,
outputs/outcomes, critical risks, indicators, etc; if any), in the Portal Continuous Reporting
tool and in accordance with the timing and conditions it sets out (as agreed with the granting
authority).
Standardised deliverables (e.g. progress reports not linked to payments, reports on cumulative
expenditure, special reports, etc; if any) must be submitted using the templates published on
the Portal.
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
In addition, the beneficiaries must provide reports to request payments, in accordance with the
schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2):
- for additional prefinancings (if any): an additional prefinancing report
- for interim payments (if any) and the final payment: a periodic report.
The prefinancing and periodic reports include a technical and financial part.
The technical part includes an overview of the action implementation. It must be prepared
using the template available in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool.
The financial part of the additional prefinancing report includes a statement on the use of the
previous prefinancing payment.
The financial part of the periodic report includes:
- the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all beneficiaries/affiliated
entities)
- the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
- the certificates on the financial statements (CFS): not applicable.
45Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The financial statements must detail the contributions for the units implemented in the
reporting period.
Unit contributions which are not declared in a financial statement will not be taken into
account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statements (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the
beneficiaries confirm that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the unit contributions declared are eligible (see Article 6)
- the contributions can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting documents
(see Article 20) that will be produced upon request (see Article 19) or in the context
of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 25).
Beneficiaries will have to submit also the financial statements of their affiliated entities (if
any). In case of recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the
financial statements of their affiliated entities.
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
The financial statements must be drafted in euro.
21.4 Reporting language
The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
21.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a report submitted does not comply with this Article, the granting authority may suspend
the payment deadline (see Article 29) and apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the
grant or the coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in
Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 22 — PAYMENTS AND RECOVERIES — CALCULATION OF
AMOUNTS DUE
22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.2) and must be distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to
distribution of the initial prefinancing payment; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment
obligation.
46Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date
when they are debited to its account.
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it
turns out that the granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts
undue.
Each beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is in principle limited to their
own debt and undue amounts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4), affiliated entities will be held liable for
repaying debts of their beneficiaries, if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.4).
22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Prefinancing payments
The aim of the prefinancing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
For additional prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous
prefinancing payment shows that less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data
Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the 70% threshold and the amount used.
The contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism will be retained from the prefinancing
payments (at the rate and in accordance with the modalities set out in the Data Sheet, see
Point 4.2) and transferred to the Mechanism.
Prefinancing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent)
against amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to
that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
47Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
At beneficiary termination there will be no payment, but the grant must be provisionally
closed for the beneficiary which leaves the consortium (and the affiliated entities which had to
end their participation together with the beneficiary, if any).
Payments (if any) will be made with the next interim or final payment.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary
for all reporting periods, by calculating the unit contributions for the accepted units.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the
distribution of payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{ total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments received (if
any)}}.
If the balance is positive, the amount will be included in the next interim or final payment to
the consortium.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this
amount to be paid to the coordinator (confirmation letter).
If payment is not made to the coordinator by the date specified in the confirmation letter, the
granting authority may call on the Mutual Insurance Mechanism to intervene, if continuation
of the action is guaranteed and the conditions set out in the rules governing the Mechanism
are met.
In this case, it will send a beneficiary recovery letter, together with a debit note with the
terms and date for payment.
48Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The debit note for the beneficiary will include the amount calculated for the affiliated entities
which also had to end their participation (if any).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
The amounts will later on also be taken into account for the next interim or final payment.
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible contributions claimed for the units implemented
during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out
the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply
recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the
reporting period, by calculating the unit contributions for the accepted units.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary
termination (if any). The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of prefinancing and
interim payments (if any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the eligible contributions claimed for
the remaining units implemented (if any).
49Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report. Its approval does not imply
recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all
reporting periods, by calculating the unit contributions for the accepted units.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
If the resulting amount is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.2, it will
be limited to the latter.
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Not applicable
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of prefinancing
and interim payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{
final grant amount
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments made (if
any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
The amount retained for the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (see above) will be released and
paid to the coordinator (in accordance with the rules governing the Mechanism).
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
50Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
If — despite the release of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism contribution — the balance is
negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why
- requesting a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiaries within 30 days
of receiving notification and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received) and the coordinator has submitted the report on the
distribution of payments, it will calculate the share of the debt per beneficiary, by:
(a) identifying the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:
{{{
total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the
action}
multiplied by
}
final grant amount for the action ,
minus
}
{prefinancing and interim payments received by the beneficiary (if any)}
and
(b) dividing the debt:
{
{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned
divided by
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to
point (a)}
multiplied by
the amount to be
recovered}.
and confirm the amount to be recovered from each beneficiary concerned (confirmation
letter), together with debit notes with the terms and date for payment.
51Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The debit notes for beneficiaries will include the amounts calculated for their affiliated
entities (if any).
If the coordinator has not submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the granting
authority will recover the full amount from the coordinator (confirmation letter and debit
note with the terms and date for payment).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see
Article 25) — the granting authority rejects unit contributions (see Article 27) or reduces the
grant (see Article 28), it will calculate the revised final grant amount for the beneficiary
concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the
beneficiary, by calculating the ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total
accepted EU contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its
share in the final grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is
calculated as follows:
{{
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the
action}
multiplied by
}
final grant amount for the action .
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons
why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
52Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be
recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent —
against any amounts owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may
be offset before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU
executive agency, debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other
Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) financial guarantee(s): not applicable
(c) joint and several liability of beneficiaries: not applicable
(d) by holding affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point
4.4) or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that the granting authority is the
European Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable
decision under Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and
Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If the Mutual Insurance Mechanism was called on by the granting authority to intervene,
recovery will be continued in the name of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism. If two debit
notes were sent, the second one (in the name of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism) will be
considered to replace the first one (in the name of the granting authority). Where the MIM
intervened, offsetting, enforceable decisions or any other of the above-mentioned forms of
enforced recovery may be used mutatis mutandis.
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in
Article 22.5, from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including
the date the full payment is received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and
then against the principal.
53Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless
Directive 2015/236632 applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by
offsetting or enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission
(see also Article 43).
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the
beneficiaries are entitled to late-payment interest at the reference rate applied by the
European Central Bank (ECB) for its main refinancing operations in euros, plus the
percentage specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The ECB reference rate to be used is the
rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as published
in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the
coordinator only on request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional
and local government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State
for the purpose of this Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not
be considered as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for
payment (see above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.
22.5.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28) and the grant or the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.

EXTENSION OF FINDINGS
25.1 Granting authority checks, reviews and audits
25.1.1 Internal checks
The granting authority may — during the action or afterwards — check the proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the obligations under the Agreement,
including assessing unit contributions, deliverables and reports.
25.1.2 Project reviews
The granting authority may carry out reviews on the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Agreement (general project reviews or specific
issues reviews).
Such project reviews may be started during the implementation of the action and until the
time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned and will be considered to start on the date of the
notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent, outside experts. If it uses
outside experts, the coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right
to object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the
deadline requested — any information and data in addition to deliverables and reports already
submitted (including information on the use of resources). The granting authority may request
beneficiaries to provide such information to it directly. Sensitive information and documents
will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings,
including with the outside experts.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises
(including to the outside experts) and must ensure that information requested is readily
available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested,
including electronic format.
On the basis of the review findings, a project review report will be drawn up.
The granting authority will formally notify the project review report to the coordinator or
beneficiary concerned, which has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations.
Project reviews (including project review reports) will be in the language of the Agreement.
25.1.3 Audits
The granting authority may carry out audits on the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Agreement.
55Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Such audits may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the beneficiary
concerned and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
The granting authority may use its own audit service, delegate audits to a centralised service
or use external audit firms. If it uses an external firm, the beneficiary concerned will be
informed and have the right to object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of
interest.
The beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline
requested — any information (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or
other personal data) to verify compliance with the Agreement. Sensitive information and
documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises
(including for the external audit firm) and must ensure that information requested is readily
available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested,
including electronic format.
On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which
has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and
will be formally notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement.
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights
of checks, reviews and audits as the granting authority.
25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the
periodic assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.
25.4 OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
The following bodies may also carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations — during
the action or afterwards:
56Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
33
- the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) under Regulations No 883/2013 and No
34
2185/96
- the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) under Regulation 2017/1939
- the European Court of Auditors (ECA) under Article 287 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 263 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If requested by these bodies, the beneficiary concerned must provide full, accurate and
complete information in the format requested (including complete accounts, individual salary
statements or other personal data, including in electronic format) and allow access to sites and
premises for on-the-spot visits or inspections — as provided for under these Regulations.
To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the
action, at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until
any ongoing checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have
been concluded.
25.5 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations — Extension of
findings
25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures
described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount
(see Article 22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may
lead to a request for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set
out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities,
fraud or breach of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU
grants awarded under similar conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
33 Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September
2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing

57Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Findings of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this
grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions, to have committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or
breach of obligations that have a material impact on this grant and
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the
list of grants affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to
extend the findings and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of unit contributions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors, to calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or
practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations,
revised financial statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction
method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the
implementation (i.e. start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the
revised financial statements or the announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see
Articles 27 and 28).
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, unit contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.

EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the
objectives and indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit
set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or
beneficiaries and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact
of the action, including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may
apply the measures described in Chapter 5.
CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at beneficiary termination, interim payment, final payment or
afterwards — reject any unit contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in particular
following checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant
(see Article 25).
Ineligible unit contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The
coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification —
submit observations if it disagrees with the rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects unit contributions, it will deduct them from the contributions
declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
59Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards —
reduce the grant for a beneficiary, if:
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and
proportionate to the seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach
of obligations, by applying an individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the
reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving
notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the reduction (payment review
procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the
amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment
cannot be processed because:
60Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or
additional information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing extension procedure,
queries about eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons
why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will
be lifted — and the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to
confirm if the suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the
revised report is not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority
may also terminate the grant or the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for
one or more beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make
partial payment(s) for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the
61Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
payment (or recovery) of the remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to
be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the
coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting
authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the
suspension end date.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For
interim payments, the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article
21) must not contain any financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated
entities). The coordinator must include them in the next periodic report after the suspension is
lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of the action — in the last periodic report.
ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional
circumstances — in particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation
impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission
of the amendment request and
- the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately
request another amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption
62Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes
necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been
terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the suspension end
date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no units may be implemented.
Ongoing units must be interrupted and no new units may be started. Unit contributions for
activities implemented during grant suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(c) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA suspension grounds: the action has lost its scientific or
technological relevance.
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
63Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification).
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority
will formally notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the
suspension end date and invite the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to
set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the
grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the
suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be before the date
on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no units may be implemented
Ongoing units must be interrupted and no new units may be started. Unit contributions for
activities implemented during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see
Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a
beneficiary (see Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a
periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination).
64Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of
the report submitted and taking into account the unit contributions for activities implemented
before the end of work date (see Article 22).
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only unit
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries,
on request of the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment
request must be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting
period until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the
financial statement and the explanation on the use of resources,
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
65Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary;
change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the
report submitted and taking into account the unit contributions for activities implemented
before the end of work date (see Article 22).
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the
next reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only unit
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into
question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant
termination (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21
(reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27
(rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.3 EU-initiated GA or beneficiary termination
32.3.1 Conditions
The granting authority may terminate the grant or the participation of one or more
beneficiaries, if:
(a) one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 40)
(b) a change to the action or the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership
situation of a beneficiary is likely to substantially affect the implementation of the
action or calls into question the decision to award the grant (including changes linked
to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour)
(c) following termination of one or more beneficiaries, the necessary changes to the
Agreement (and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
66Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
(d) implementation of the action has become impossible or the changes necessary for its
continuation would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants
(e) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is subject to bankruptcy
proceedings or similar (including insolvency, winding-up, administration by a
liquidator or court, arrangement with creditors, suspension of business activities, etc.)
(f) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is in breach of social
security or tax obligations
(g) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been found guilty of
grave professional misconduct
(h) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed fraud,
corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money laundering, terrorism-
related crimes (including terrorism financing), child labour or human trafficking
(i) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) was created under a
different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social or other legal
obligations in the country of origin (or created another entity with this purpose)
(j) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.)
(k) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in
other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(l) despite a specific request by the granting authority, a beneficiary does not request —
through the coordinator — an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of
one of its affiliated entities or associated partners that is in one of the situations under
points (d), (f), (e), (g), (h), (i) or (j) and to reallocate its tasks, or
(m) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
67Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA termination grounds: the action has lost its scientific or
technological relevance.
32.3.2 Procedure
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting
authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will
take effect (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is
discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also
inform the coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit
a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the
basis of the report submitted (see Article 22). Only units implemented until
termination will be accepted.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator
may not submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only unit
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see
Article 28) or to impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority
(see Article 33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
68Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —
submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open
reporting period until termination, containing an overview of the progress
of the work, the financial statement, and the explanation on the use of
resources
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated
beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of
the report submitted (see Article 22). Only units implemented until termination will be
accepted.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report
for the next reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline,
only unit contributions included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments
within the deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned
and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal
treatment of applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.

SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND ADMINISTRATIVE
SANCTIONS
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to
third parties as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross
negligence.
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the
beneficiaries or other participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the
implementation of the Agreement.
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a
result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full
compliance with the Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.
The liability does not extend to indirect or consequential losses or similar damage (such as
loss of profit, loss of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by
wilful act or by a breach of confidentiality.
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as preventing the adoption of administrative
sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public
law measures, in addition or as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this
Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to 148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and
Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 2988/9535).
SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot
be considered in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants
involved in the action) and
35 Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European
Communities financial interests (OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1).
70Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without
delay, stating the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force
majeure and do their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.
CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal, in accordance with the
Portal Terms and Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if
explicitly instructed otherwise by the granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the grant agreement (project
number and acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and
Conditions. For naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated —
before the signature of this Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’.
The role and tasks of the LEAR are stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms
and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the
Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of
sending, as indicated by the time logs.
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the
communication is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not
been accessed within 10 days after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general
principles apply (i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with
proof of delivery will be considered to have been received either on the delivery date
registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be
considered in breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Addresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
71Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is
the official mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.
ARTICLE 37 — INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT
The provisions in the Data Sheet take precedence over the rest of the Terms and Conditions of
the Agreement.
Annex 5 takes precedence over the Terms and Conditions; the Terms and Conditions take
precedence over the Annexes other than Annex 5.
Annex 2 takes precedence over Annex 1.
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7136, periods expressed in days, months or years are
calculated from the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement
which would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in
the Portal Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries
(see Annex 3). If a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission
must be done by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
36 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to
periods, dates and time-limits (OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
72Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or
proof that this opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45
days of receiving notification (or any additional information the granting authority has
requested). If it does not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same
deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no
notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the
amendment.
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession
form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry
into force of the Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
its entry into force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must
— within 30 days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and
make any changes necessary to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not
affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with
Article 39. It must include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary
directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the
grant to a new beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
73Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal
Amendment tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE
GRANTING AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting
authority to any third party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority
on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed,
the assignment will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations
towards the granting authority.
ARTICLE 43 — APPLICABLE LAW AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
43.1 Applicable law
The Agreement is governed by the applicable EU law, supplemented if necessary by the law
of Belgium.
Special rules may apply for beneficiaries which are international organisations (if any; see
Data Sheet, Point 5).
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties
must bring action before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice —
under Article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium — unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU
court judgements.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet,
Point 5), the dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in
accordance with the Rules for Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under
Article 299 TFEU (see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the
General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions
against offsetting and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European
Commission (not against the granting authority; see also Article 22).

SPECIFIC RULES
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY (— ARTICLE 13)
Sensitive information with security recommendation
Sensitive information with a security recommendation must comply with the additional
requirements imposed by the granting authority.
Before starting the action tasks concerned, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals
or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task. The documents must be
kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting authority. If they
are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary.
For requirements restricting disclosure or dissemination, the information must be handled in
accordance with the recommendation and may be disclosed or disseminated only after written
approval from the granting authority.
EU classified information
If EU classified information is used or generated by the action, it must be treated in
accordance with the security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter (SAL) set
out in Annex 1 and Decision 2015/44439 and its implementing rules — until it is declassified.
Deliverables which contain EU classified information must be submitted according to special
procedures agreed with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving EU classified information may be subcontracted only with prior
explicit written approval from the granting authority and only to entities established in an EU
Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of information agreement with the EU
(or an administrative arrangement with the Commission).
EU classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants
involved in the action implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the
granting authority.
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14)
Ethics and research integrity
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
39 Commission Decision 2015/444/EC, Euratom of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p. 53).
82Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity)
and
- applicable EU, international and national law, including the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms and its Supplementary Protocols.
No funding can be granted, within or outside the EU, for activities that are prohibited in all
Member States. No funding can be granted in a Member State for an activity which is
forbidden in that Member State.
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality, the right to
privacy, the right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental
integrity of persons, the right to non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the
environment and high levels of human health protection.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action have an exclusive focus on
civil applications.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action do not:
- aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes
- intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such
modifications heritable (with the exception of research relating to cancer treatment of
the gonads, which may be financed)
- intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose
of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or
- lead to the destruction of human embryos (for example, for obtaining stem cells).
Activities involving research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells may be
carried out only if:
- they are set out in Annex 1 or
- the coordinator has obtained explicit approval (in writing) from the granting authority.
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the fundamental principle of research integrity —
40
as set out in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity .
This implies compliance with the following principles:
- reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology,
the analysis and the use of resources
40 European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity of ALLEA (All European Academies).
83Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research
in a transparent, fair and unbiased way
- respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and
the environment
- accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and
organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts
and means that beneficiaries must ensure that persons carrying out research tasks follow the
good research practices including ensuring, where possible, openness, reproducibility and
traceability and refrain from the research integrity violations described in the Code.
Activities raising ethical issues must comply with the additional requirements formulated by
the ethics panels (including after checks, reviews or audits; see Article 25).
Before starting an action task raising ethical issues, the beneficiaries must have obtained all
approvals or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any
(national or local) ethics committee or other bodies such as data protection authorities.
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the
granting authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English
summary, which shows that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the
conclusions of the committee or authority concerned (if any).
VALUES (— ARTICLE 14)
Gender mainstreaming
The beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities between men and
women in the implementation of the action and, where applicable, in line with the gender
equality plan. They must aim, to the extent possible, for a gender balance at all levels of
personnel assigned to the action, including at supervisory and managerial level.

Scope of the obligations
For this section, references to ‘beneficiary’ or ‘beneficiaries’ do not include affiliated entities
(if any).
Agreement on background — Background free from restrictions
The beneficiaries must identify in a written agreement the background as needed for
implementing the action or for exploiting its results.
Where the call conditions restrict control due to strategic interests reasons, background that is
subject to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one
of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the
exploitation of the results (i.e. would make the exploitation of the results subject to control or
restrictions) must not be used and must be explicitly excluded in the agreement on
background — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
Results free from restrictions
Where the call conditions restrict control due to strategic interests reasons, the beneficiaries
must ensure that the results of the action are not subject to control or other restrictions by a
country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries or target countries
set out in the call conditions — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them.
However, two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:
85Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- they have jointly generated them and
- it is not possible to:
- establish the respective contribution of each beneficiary, or
- separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their
protection.
The joint owners must agree — in writing — on the allocation and terms of exercise of their
joint ownership (‘joint ownership agreement’), to ensure compliance with their obligations
under this Agreement.
Unless otherwise agreed in the joint ownership agreement or consortium agreement, each
joint owner may grant non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the jointly-owned
results (without any right to sub-license), if the other joint owners are given:
- at least 45 days advance notice and
- fair and reasonable compensation.
The joint owners may agree — in writing — to apply another regime than joint ownership.
If third parties (including employees and other personnel) may claim rights to the results, the
beneficiary concerned must ensure that those rights can be exercised in a manner compatible
with its obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must indicate the owner(s) of the results (results ownership list) in the final
periodic report.
Protection of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must adequately protect their
results — for an appropriate period and with appropriate territorial coverage — if protection
is possible and justified, taking into account all relevant considerations, including the
prospects for commercial exploitation, the legitimate interests of the other beneficiaries and
any other legitimate interests.
Exploitation of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must — up to four years after the
end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) — use their best efforts to exploit their results
directly or to have them exploited indirectly by another entity, in particular through transfer or
licensing.
If, despite a beneficiary’s best efforts, the results are not exploited within one year after the
end of the action, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the granting
authority) use the Horizon Results Platform to find interested parties to exploit the results.
If results are incorporated in a standard, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed with
the granting authority or unless it is impossible) ask the standardisation body to include the
funding statement (see Article 17) in (information related to) the standard.
86Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Additional exploitation obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations (including obligations
linked to the restriction of participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy
or security reasons), the beneficiaries must comply with them — up to four years after the end
of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations in case of a public
emergency, the beneficiaries must (if requested by the granting authority) grant for a limited
period of time specified in the request, non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable
conditions — to their results to legal entities that need the results to address the public
emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services at
fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after the end of the
action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Additional information obligation relating to standards
Where the call conditions impose additional information obligations relating to possible
standardisation, the beneficiaries must — up to four years after the end of the action (see Data
Sheet, Point 1) — inform the granting authority, if the results could reasonably be expected to
contribute to European or international standards.
Transfer and licensing of results
Transfer of ownership
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect
compliance with their obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under the Agreement regarding their
results are passed on to the new owner and that this new owner has the obligation to pass
them on in any subsequent transfer.
Moreover, they must inform the other beneficiaries with access rights of the transfer at least
45 days in advance (or less if agreed in writing), unless agreed otherwise in writing for
specifically identified third parties including affiliated entities or unless impossible under the
applicable law. This notification must include sufficient information on the new owner to
enable the beneficiaries concerned to assess the effects on their access rights. The
beneficiaries may object within 30 days of receiving notification (or less if agreed in writing),
if they can show that the transfer would adversely affect their access rights. In this case, the
transfer may not take place until agreement has been reached between the beneficiaries
concerned.
Granting licences
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results (or otherwise give the right to exploit
them), including on an exclusive basis, provided this does not affect compliance with their
obligations.
Exclusive licences for results may be granted only if all the other beneficiaries concerned
have waived their access rights.
87Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing — Horizon Europe actions
Where the call conditions in Horizon Europe actions provide for the right to object to transfers
or licensing, the granting authority may — up to four years after the end of the action (see
Data Sheet, Point 1) — object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results,
if:
- the beneficiaries which generated the results have received funding under the grant
- it is to a legal entity established in a non-EU country not associated with Horizon
Europe, and
- the granting authority considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with EU
interests.
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally
notify the granting authority before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential
exploitation of the results, and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU
interests, in particular regarding competitiveness as well as consistency with
ethical principles and security considerations.
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the granting authority decides to object to a transfer or exclusive licence, it must formally
notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional
information it has requested).
No transfer or licensing may take place in the following cases:
- pending the granting authority decision, within the period set out above
- if the granting authority objects
- until the conditions are complied with, if the granting authority objection comes
with conditions.
A beneficiary may formally notify a request to waive the right to object regarding intended
transfers or grants to a specifically identified third party, if measures safeguarding EU
interests are in place. If the granting authority agrees, it will formally notify the beneficiary
concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information requested).
Limitations to transfers and licensing due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security
reasons of the EU and its Member States
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests,
autonomy or security reasons, the beneficiaries may not transfer ownership of their results or
grant licences to third parties which are established in countries which are not eligible
88Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by
such countries or entities from such countries) — unless they have requested and received
prior approval by the granting authority.
The request must:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation
of the results, and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or license on the
strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States.
The granting authority may request additional information.
Access rights to results and background
Exercise of access rights — Waiving of access rights — No sub-licensing
Requests to exercise access rights and the waiver of access rights must be in writing.
Unless agreed otherwise in writing with the beneficiary granting access, access rights do not
include the right to sub-license.
If a beneficiary is no longer involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant
access.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary no
longer has access rights.
Access rights for implementing the action
The beneficiaries must grant each other access — on a royalty-free basis — to background
needed to implement their own tasks under the action, unless the beneficiary that holds the
background has — before acceding to the Agreement —:
- informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is subject to restrictions,
or
- agreed with the other beneficiaries that access would not be on a royalty-free basis.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access — on a royalty-free basis — to results needed
for implementing their own tasks under the action.
Access rights for exploiting the results
The beneficiaries must grant each other access — under fair and reasonable conditions — to
results needed for exploiting their results.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access — under fair and reasonable conditions — to
background needed for exploiting their results, unless the beneficiary that holds the
89Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
background has — before acceding to the Agreement — informed the other beneficiaries that
access to its background is subject to restrictions.
Requests for access must be made — unless agreed otherwise in writing — up to one year
after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Access rights for entities under the same control
Unless agreed otherwise in writing by the beneficiaries, access to results and, subject to the
restrictions referred to above (if any), background must also be granted — under fair and
reasonable conditions — to entities that:
- are established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe associated country
- are under the direct or indirect control of another beneficiary, or under the same direct
or indirect control as that beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling that
beneficiary and
- need the access to exploit the results of that beneficiary.
Unless agreed otherwise in writing, such requests for access must be made by the entity
directly to the beneficiary concerned.
Requests for access must be made — unless agreed otherwise in writing — up to one year
after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and
national authorities to results for policy purposes — Horizon Europe actions
In Horizon Europe actions, the beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant
must grant access to their results — on a royalty-free basis — to the granting authority, EU
institutions, bodies, offices or agencies for developing, implementing and monitoring EU
policies or programmes. Such access rights do not extend to beneficiaries’ background.
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
For actions under the cluster ‘Civil Security for Society’, such access rights also extend to
national authorities of EU Member States for developing, implementing and monitoring their
policies or programmes in this area. In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to
define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency
(including the granting authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.
Additional access rights
Where the call conditions impose additional access rights, the beneficiaries must comply with
them.

COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION, OPEN SCIENCE AND VISIBILITY (—
ARTICLE 17)
Dissemination
Dissemination of results
The beneficiaries must disseminate their results as soon as feasible, in a publicly available
format, subject to any restrictions due to the protection of intellectual property, security rules
or legitimate interests.
A beneficiary that intends to disseminate its results must give at least 15 days advance notice
to the other beneficiaries (unless agreed otherwise), together with sufficient information on
the results it will disseminate.
Any other beneficiary may object within (unless agreed otherwise) 15 days of receiving
notification, if it can show that its legitimate interests in relation to the results or background
would be significantly harmed. In such cases, the results may not be disseminated unless
appropriate steps are taken to safeguard those interests.
Additional dissemination obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional dissemination obligations, the beneficiaries must
also comply with those.
Open Science
Open science: open access to scientific publications
The beneficiaries must ensure open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to
their results. In particular, they must ensure that:
- at the latest at the time of publication, a machine-readable electronic copy of the
published version or the final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication, is
deposited in a trusted repository for scientific publications
- immediate open access is provided to the deposited publication via the repository,
under the latest available version of the Creative Commons Attribution International
Public Licence (CC BY) or a licence with equivalent rights; for monographs and other
long-text formats, the licence may exclude commercial uses and derivative works (e.g.
CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND) and
- information is given via the repository about any research output or any other tools
and instruments needed to validate the conclusions of the scientific publication.
Beneficiaries (or authors) must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with the
open access requirements.
Metadata of deposited publications must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain
Dedication (CC 0) or equivalent, in line with the FAIR principles (in particular machine-
actionable) and provide information at least about the following: publication (author(s), title,
date of publication, publication venue); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project
91Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
name, acronym and number; licensing terms; persistent identifiers for the publication, the
authors involved in the action and, if possible, for their organisations and the grant. Where
applicable, the metadata must include persistent identifiers for any research output or any
other tools and instruments needed to validate the conclusions of the publication.
Open science: research data management
The beneficiaries must manage the digital research data generated in the action (‘data’)
responsibly, in line with the FAIR principles and by taking all of the following actions:
- establish a data management plan (‘DMP’) (and regularly update it)
- as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP, deposit the data in a
trusted repository; if required in the call conditions, this repository must be federated
in the EOSC in compliance with EOSC requirements
- as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP, ensure open access —
via the repository — to the deposited data, under the latest available version of the
Creative Commons Attribution International Public License (CC BY) or Creative
Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or a licence/dedication with equivalent
rights, following the principle ‘as open as possible as closed as necessary’, unless
providing open access would in particular:
- be against the beneficiary’s legitimate interests, including regarding
commercial exploitation, or
- be contrary to any other constraints, in particular the EU competitive interests
or the beneficiary’s obligations under this Agreement; if open access is not
provided (to some or all data), this must be justified in the DMP
- provide information via the repository about any research output or any other tools and
instruments needed to re-use or validate the data.
Metadata of deposited data must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain
Dedication (CC 0) or equivalent (to the extent legitimate interests or constraints are
safeguarded), in line with the FAIR principles (in particular machine-actionable) and provide
information at least about the following: datasets (description, date of deposit, author(s) and
embargo); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and number;
licensing terms; persistent identifiers for the dataset, the authors involved in the action, and, if
possible, for their organisations and the grant. Where applicable, the metadata must include
persistent identifiers for related publications and other research outputs.
Open science: additional practices
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding open science practices, the
beneficiaries must also comply with those.
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding the validation of scientific
publications, the beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access to data or other results
needed for validation of the conclusions of scientific publications, to the extent that their
92Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
legitimate interests or constraints are safeguarded (and unless they already provided (open)
access at publication).
Where the call conditions impose additional open science obligations in case of a public
emergency, the beneficiaries must (if requested by the granting authority) immediately
deposit any research output in a trusted repository and provide open access to it under a CC
BY licence, a Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or equivalent. As an exception, if the access
would be against the beneficiaries’ legitimate interests, the beneficiaries must grant non-
exclusive licenses — under fair and reasonable conditions — to legal entities that need the
research output to address the public emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit
the resulting products and services at fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up
to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities
Unless excluded by the call conditions, the beneficiaries must provide and regularly update a
plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities.
SPECIFIC RULES FOR CARRYING OUT THE ACTION (— ARTICLE 18)
Implementation in case of restrictions due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security of the EU and its Member States
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests,
autonomy or security, the beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as
affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions,
subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties are established in countries
which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or, if
applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless
otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation with entities established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or,
if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect
the strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States.
Specific rules for MSCA actions
When implementing MSCA Doctoral Networks (DN), Postdoctoral Fellowships (PF) and
COFUND actions, the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions:
- take all measures to implement the principles set out in Annex II to the Council

General Introduction
Delivering on EU policy priorities
With this work programme, the EU will invest nearly €15.6 billion4 in research and innovation that
will shape the future of Europe. A substantial part of this funding will be dedicated to targeted
actions that support the green and digital transitions for our societies and economies as well as our
security, resilience and a sustainable recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of Horizon
Europe in general, and this work programme in particular, is to create opportunities for the EU and
the world of tomorrow from the challenges of today.
In the light of the new geo-political situation following Russia’s unjustified military invasion of
Ukraine, this work programme places a special emphasis on actions that contribute to a safe and
secure Europe, help reduce energy- and other dependencies and build a more robust economic base.
In particular, actions included will help accelerate the clean energy transition in line with the
REPowerEU Plan5, improve food security, cybersecurity, help ensure open strategic autonomy and
reduce dependencies on critical raw materials, and accelerate delivery of the Green Deal. For
example, a package of actions across the ‘Climate, Energy and Mobility’, ‘Digital, Industry and Space’
and ‘Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment’ clusters in particular will
aim to speed up the clean energy transition. In addition, this work programme includes targeted
actions to support Ukraine such as providing additional fellowships to displaced researchers from
Ukraine to resume their research activities at host organisations established in EU Member States or
Horizon Europe Associated Countries, reinforcing Ukrainian researchers’ access to European research
infrastructures and assessing the state of research infrastructure in Ukraine, while the EU Mission for
Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities will support a number of Ukrainian cities in integrating the
principles of climate neutrality in their reconstruction.
The European Commission encourages all potential participants in actions in this work programme to
create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular researchers
and innovators previously active in Ukraine, Ukrainian researchers and innovators who are unable to
return to Ukraine in the given circumstances as well as those who remain in Ukraine but have limited
means to continue their work.6
In order to support our commitment to make the EU the world’s first climate-neutral continent by
2050, Horizon Europe will direct a minimum of 35% of the funding available to climate objectives.
These funds will be used for projects that advance the science of climate change, develop solutions
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to adapt to the changing climate. For example, activities
will accelerate the transition towards zero-pollution production, clean energy and mobility in a
sustainable, fair and inlcusiveway, help adapt food systems and support the circular and bio-
economy, maintain and enhance natural carbon sinks in ecosystems, and foster adaptation to climate
change. Jointly such activities will be fundamental to create the new products, services and business
models needed to sustain or enable EU industrial leadership and competitiveness, and to create new
markets for climate neutral and circular products and services.
The New European Bauhaus is an initiative in the wider context of the European Green Deal, which
aims to show the benefits of the green transition in people’s daily lives and living spaces. Research

General Introduction
and innovation policy is an integral part of the New European Bauhaus’s enabling framework7.
Horizon Europe contributes by supporting, across many areas and disciplines, the holistic
transformation of the built environment and land-use complex with a regenerative design approach.8
In 2024, a new destination is added in the Missions and cross-cutting activities part, which will build
on the New European Bauhaus activities, calls and experiences so far and anchor the New European
Bauhaus values of sustainability, aesthetics and inclusion in R&I, paying special attention to the green
transition at the level of neighbourhoods and communities. By adopting the New European Bauhaus’
integrated approach that brings together sustainability, inclusion, and aesthetics through the active
participation of citizens and the integration of arts and cultures in transformation processes, the
Destination will contribute to developing a new generation of solutions, closer to people and their
needs.
In support of the digital transition, this work programme will foster research and innovation to make
this decade Europe’s digital decade and lay the ground work to ensure that all actors of society,
including enterprises, master the complex interplay of technology and humankind, for a better
society and life, fully respecting universal human rights and planetary boundaries. For instance,
actions supported by this work programme will help to maximise the full potential of human-centric
digital tools and data-enabled research and innovation in a wide range of sectors, such as healthcare,
cultural and creative industries, energy and mobility as well as food production, and support the
deep transformations required for the modernisation of traditional industrial models. Investing in
new digital infrastructures has the potential to foster collaboration across the EU, as for instance
initiatives such as the Cultural Heritage Cloud, which aims at helping this sector to successfully cope
with the challenges the digital transition brings. Using an EU- coefficient type calculation system it is
estimated that 33.6%9 of funds in the present work programme, and 36.5% of funds across all parts
of Horizon Europe contribute to the digital transition. This equals overall investments of €9.9 billion
during 2023-2024. The overall investment into main digital activities, i.e. the development of core
digital technologies, is estimated at €3.7 billion in 2023-2024.
Finally, this work programme will direct investments of more than €1 billion in 2023 from
NextGeneration EU to help repair the immediate economic and social damage brought about by the
COVID-19 pandemic and to create a post-COVID-19 Europe that is greener, more digital, more
resilient, more inclusive and better fit for the current and forthcoming challenges. This is done
through topics contributing to a green, digitally-enabled recovery, , improving health systems,
transport and education., topics contributing to research capacities, including for vaccine
development, and supporting actions to increase preparedness for future crises.

General Introduction
Investing in the green transition, climate action and biodiversity
The green transition guides significant parts of Horizon Europe’s investments. The commitment to
spend at least 35% of resources on climate action and strengthen investments in biodiversity applies
to the entirety of Horizon Europe including the European Research Council (ERC), the European
Innovation Council (EIC) and Institutionalised European Partnerships. These are not included in this
work programme.
Taking into account all work programmes for Horizon Europe 2023-202410 it is estimated that overall
35.6% of funds will contribute to climate action; and 8.8% to biodiversity related policy objectives.
The parts of the present work programme dedicated to the clusters of Pillar II, ‘Global Challenges and
European Industrial Competitiveness’, research infrastructures, widening participation &
strengthening the European research area, European innovation ecosystems and the EU Missions
together contribute €6.07 billion to climate action, equal to 42.6% of the present work programme
budget. Furthermore, these parts will contribute €1.67 billion to biodiversity, equal to 13.3% of the
present work programme budget. €461 million of the contributions to biodiversity are from the
activities described in the EU Missions. The investment in climate action is a good approximation of
investments in the green transitions, monitoring of expenditure will provide more precise data also
on other aspects like investments in ‘clean air’ or specific SDGs.
Contributions to climate action are made by 90% of the budget of cluster ‘Climate, energy, and
mobility’ (€2.27 billion), 55% of the cluster ‘Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and
Environment’ (€998 million), 48% of the cluster ‘Digital, Industry and Space’ (€1.32 billion) and 5.5%
of the cluster ‘Health’ (€80 million). The actions described in the work programme part on EU
Missions allocate €806 million, equal to 65% of the Missions’ allocated budget, to climate action.
To ensure a contribution over 35% in the lifetime of the Horizon Europe programme the expenditure
estimates will be updated continuously. The methodology to generate these estimates is based on
the ‘EU-coefficients’ methodology11.
Horizon Europe is committed to the ‘Do no harm’-principle (Green Oath), that applies to all EU
programmes as expressed in the agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework12. To that end,
10 The Horizon Europe components European Research Council, Marie Sklodowska Curie Actions, the European
Innovation Council, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, as well as the Institutionalised
European Partnerships based on Articles 185/187 TFEU and the direct actions by the Joint Research Centre
have a combined budget of 12.043 billion equal to 46.81% of Horizon Europe total.
11 EU-coefficients are based on the internationally recognized Rio-markers methods originally developed by
OECD (see further information here.) The EU coefficients assigns 0-40-100% markers to actions and their
budgets depending on climate action having a major impact (100%), a significant impact (40%) or a marginal
impact (0%) of an activity. In this work programme the coefficients are applied to every topic described for
climate action, biodiversity, clean air, digital transition and artificial intelligence. For other parts of Horizon
Europe they are applied to larger groups of actions and in general to awarded projects for expenditure
monitoring and documentation. Actions can be assigned more than one coefficient if they contribute
substantially to more than one of the related objectives.

General Introduction
the proposed outcomes of topics in this work programme have been screened for potential
detrimental effects on the green transition and on the objectives of the Green Deal related policies13,
and on supporting mid- and long term policy objectives notably of the green and digital transition
and societal and economic resilience– Horizon Europe funds research conducted according to highest
ethical standards, expressed in the ethics appraisal (for details see the Horizon Europe programme
guide14). Ethics standards include an environmental ethics dimension to which proposals have to
adhere. Evaluators may ask for ethics screening of proposals as part of the evaluation or ask for
checks and audits during project implementation. Potential applicants and participants to actions in
this programme can contribute to this aim by reflecting on minimising the direct environmental
impacts from their activities in their application form (proposal part B template) e.g. in their choice of
methods, the organisation of work, notably the related travel, and from future use of the results15.
Delivering on the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024
This work programme for 2023-2024 is a key step in delivering on the priorities set out in the Horizon
Europe Strategic Plan for 2021-202416. Based on the overarching EU policy priorities, the Strategic
Plan sets out four key strategic orientations and 15 impact areas. These are based on 32 expected
impacts that have been defined in an inclusive and ambitious strategic planning process. Each
expected impact is targeted via dedicated packages of actions in the work programme. These are
termed ‘destinations’, because they indicate both the specific direction and the ultimate point of
arrival of the projects to be supported through Horizon Europe. An overview of all expected impacts
of the Strategic Plan and the corresponding destinations in the work programme parts for the six
clusters can be found in the appendix to this introduction.
From EU priorities to work programme destinations
13 For Horizon Europe’s innovation support provided closer to commercialisation by this work programme as
well as by the European Innovation Council, the European Commission wants to apply standards that are not
lower than those of the EU taxonomy regulation that apply to commercial activities and investments. The
ambition to raise standards and environmental performance is reflected in the formulation of topics, their
scope and expected outcomes.

General Introduction
The four key strategic orientations in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 each define a set
of higher-level objectives where research and innovation investments are expected to make a
difference. The four key strategic orientations are:
Key Strategic Orientation A Key Strategic Orientation B
Promoting an open strategic autonomy by
leading the development of key digital, Restoring Europe’s ecosystems and
enabling and emerging technologies, sectors biodiversity, and managing sustainably
and value chains to accelerate and steer the natural resources to ensure food security and

systems
green and digital transitions
Below, each key strategic orientation is presented along with its impact areas. For each impact area,
some examples are given to illustrate the activities in the work programme that will implement it.
A - Promoting an open strategic autonomy17 by leading the development of key digital,
enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains
As set out in the Versailles declaration18 following Russia’s unjustified military invasion of Ukraine on
24 February 2022, Europe’s economic base needs to be more resilient, competitive and fit for the
green and digital transitions, while leaving no one behind. Current strategic dependencies related to
sensitive areas such as critical raw materials and the digital area are evident across the EU society
and economy and need to be addressed. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, new technologies
have kept our businesses and public services running and our family and social bonds afloat. A
number of these are now thoroughly ingrained in our everyday lives, and today, the data economy
lies at the heart of innovation and job creation. The European Union has the ambition of empowering
European citizens with digital solutions rooted in our common values and enriching the lives of all of
us. This work programme will help shape innovative technologies and solutions in a wide range of
applications, paving the way to a resilient, inclusive, regenerative and circular economy, reducing
strategic dependencies. Thereby, it will also underpin the open strategic autonomy of Europe and its
global leadership in digital and emerging enabling technologies.
A total number of eleven expected impacts contribute to this key strategic objective and its four
impact areas, all of which are being put into effect through this work programme. The following
examples provide an illustration of how this is achieved:
17 ‘Open strategic autonomy’ refers to the term ‘strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy’, as
reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1–2 October 2020.

General Introduction
➢ To promote industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people,
the co-programmed Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, Data and Robotics will drive the
development of human-centric, trustworthy, safe and robust technologies that will boost
new markets and applications and that are compatible with Europe’s ethical standards and
values. A dedicated action will also examine humanistic deployment of artificial intelligence
and related technologies. Within the quantum field, this work programme will target efforts
to ensure that Europe will have its first computer with quantum acceleration by 2025, also
paving the way for Europe to be at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030. Efforts
will also support the ambitions of the future European Chips Act, including by supporting
research at lower Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)19 in micro-electronics and integration
technologies for industrial solutions.
➢ In order to attain secure and cybersecure digital technology, this work programme supports
research and innovation on cybersecure technology and its implications. For this work
programme, efforts will include actions aimed at enhancing prevention and deterrence of
advanced forms of cyber threats and cyber-dependent crime and tracing of cryptocurrency
transactions.
➢ With a view to supporting a competitive and secure data-economy, a wide-ranging effort on
critical raw materials is undertaken, targeting all steps of the value chain from exploration,
extraction, processing and up- and recycling. Furthermore, this work programme will support
efforts to develop advanced materials that can substitute critical raw materials, for instance
in applications for the new energy innovation, promoting a circular economy and resource
efficiency while reducing strategic dependencies.
➢ To make available high quality digital services for all, it fosters research and innovation on,
for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries,
including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies,
creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users.
Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be
supported, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such
platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage
institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for
citizens and strengthen research.
B - Restoring Europe’s ecosystems and biodiversity, and managing sustainably natural
resources
Human activities create pressures on natural resources that go far beyond sustainable levels. This is
affecting ecosystems and their capacity to provide multiple services for human well-being, while
natural resources are being further degraded because of the impacts of climate change. The
European Union has the ambition to halt biodiversity decline, protect and preserve ecosystems,
manage natural resources on land and sea in a sustainable way, thereby ensuring food and nutrition
security as well as a clean and healthy environment for all. Horizon Europe will thus advance
knowledge, build capacities and provide innovative technologies and solutions to support the state
and functioning of ecosystems, to ensure a clean and healthy environment and sustainable
19 The definition of Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) is available in the General Annexes to this work
programme.

General Introduction
management of natural resources that provides for our needs and contributes to climate neutrality
and adaptation.
The following examples give an idea of how the three impact areas under this orientation are being
implemented through this work programme:
➢ With a view to developing sustainable food systems from farm to fork on land and sea, this
work programme supports research and innovation on sustainable farming, fisheries and
aquaculture as well as the transformation of food systems. It does so through a wide range
of actions, including the European partnership on accelerating farming systems transition
and the European partnership on safe and sustainable food systems for people, planet and
climate, also focusing on R&I to promote the production, provision and safe consumption of
alternative sources of protein. Actions also aim to make use of the latest digital
technologies to revolutionise fisheries control and contribute to ensuring sustainable fishing.
A number of initiatives also aim to enhance collaboration with Africa on these topics.
Furthermore, specific initiatives aim to use advanced materials for sustainable agriculture,
by creating more sustainable agrochemicals. At the other end of the food system, this work
programme will also help create biodegradable polymers for sustainable packaging materials.
➢ As a contribution to clean and healthy air, water and soil, this work programme will support
research and innovation to prevent environmental contamination, for example with actions
focusing on halting emissions of pollution to air, soil and water; also promoting sustainable
use of pesticides; protecting drinking water and managing urban water pollution, enabling
chemicals and materials that are safe and sustainable by design20 and increasing
environmental performances and sustainability of processes and products, e.g. in
construction products and textiles. Related actions will also create new knowledge about the
role of environmental pollution in human health.
➢ To enhance ecosystems and biodiversity on land and in waters, actions will focus on
understanding and addressing the main drivers of biodiversity loss; promote biodiversity
protection and restoration and help develop new biodiversity friendly practices in
agriculture, forestry, industry and aquaculture, for instance by promoting pollinator friendly
farming systems. This work programme also supports the European Biodiversity Partnership:
Biodiversa+.
C - Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable
economy
The European Union has the ambition to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in
2030, to become climate neutral by 2050 and turn into a more sustainable, bio-based, climate-
neutral, circular, non- toxic and competitive economy. This requires unprecedented changes in the
way we produce, trade, build, move around and consume, which will spur our technological,
economic and societal transformation and contribute to a green recovery. This work programme will
help transform the EU into a provider of green solutions for the benefit of all, and position Europe as
a technological and industrial leader in the green transition industry, in order to make the EU climate
neutral by transitioning all economic sectors.

General Introduction
This work programme contributes significantly to achieving the four impact areas under this
orientation through seven expected impacts, as shown by the following examples:
➢ To promote climate change mitigation and adaptation, this work programme supports
climate sciences and responses and cross-sectoral solutions for the climate transition
through dedicated destinations and topics throughout the work programme.
➢ With a view to reducing energy dependencies and promote affordable and clean energy, this
work programme supports a broad portfolio of clean and efficient demand side
technologies as well as renewable energy technologies – helping to improve the
competitiveness of more mature technologies and nurturing emerging technology solutions
– and their smart integration into the overall energy system, thus boosting the energy
transition in all its dimensions. One focus area in this regard is supporting a competitive and
sustainable European battery value chain.
➢ To further advance smart and sustainable transport, research and innovation activities will
pave the way for zero-emission, safe, resilient transport and Smart Mobility services for
passengers and goods, for example in the field of Connected, Cooperative and Automated
Mobility (CCAM). Efforts are also focused to promote zero-emission road transport;
accelerating climate neutral hydrogen-powered/electrified aviation and sustainable
waterborne transport.
➢ As a considerable contribution to regenerative, circular and clean economy, this work
programme will advance research and innovation on climate neutral, circular and digitised
production and support the European Partnerships Made in Europe, Processes4Planet and
Clean Steel, which will demonstrate EU leadership in the transformation of the
manufacturing and energy-intensive industries into circular and carbon-neutral sectors. This
work programme will also pave the way to the development of chemicals and materials fit
for the twin digital and green transition through the Safe and Sustainable by Design
approach21. Finally, efforts include a project to create one hundred circular model
households, which will pilot efforts aimed at making European households sustainable
through inclusive circular practices.
D - Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society
Social cohesion and inclusiveness and the health, well-being, rights and security of its citizens are
central aims of the EU’s policies and programmes. To uphold such objectives, the EU needs to tackle
the negative consequences of manifold challenges, such as those arising from demographic change,
globalisation, climate changes, evolving security threats and rapid technological change. These are
putting the well-being of citizens and communities under strain, thereby challenging business
models, public services, as well as the foundations of the single market and social rights. Investments
under Horizon Europe will be instrumental for the EU to develop stronger health systems, improve
health technologies and develop the knowledge and innovations that underpin the health and well-
being of all its citizens. Furthermore, Horizon Europe will facilitate the development of innovations,
policies and institutions to safeguard democratic governance, foster civic participation and enhance
trust in democratic institutions, tackling populism, polarisation and extremism. These will safeguard

General Introduction
and promote Europe’s common values and cultural heritage, and support creative ways of cultivating
independent critical thinking and inclusive debates. It will support innovative solutions for connecting
education and training to emerging social and labour market needs while improving societal
adaptation and citizens’ engagement in the green and digital transitions. It will also reinforce civil
security research for disaster risk management, border management and law enforcement while
mitigating the negative effects of acute crises.
This key strategic objective and four impact areas encompass ten expected impacts, all of which
become operative through the Horizon Europe work programme, as these examples illustrate:
➢ To secure good health and high-quality accessible healthcare, this work programme will
contribute with a wide-ranging number of activities targeting the young as well as the ‘silver’
generations, with personalised medicine and special care for people in vulnerable
situations22, as we are adapting to the post-pandemic life, for instance with actions aimed to
create evidence-based interventions for promotion of mental and physical health in changing
working environments (post-pandemic workplaces).
➢ To promote and defend a secure, open and democratic EU society, it will foster research on
how to protect, nurture and reshape democracies, through topics such as ‘Detecting,
analysing and countering foreign information manipulation and interference’;
‘Disinformation by state authorities: developing a better understanding of information
suppression’ and ‘Computational Social Science approaches in research on democratic
legitimacy, resilience of democratic institutions and the new patterns of democratic
participation’. It will also support actions to combat hate speech on the internet and beyond.
It will support critical infrastructures against physical and cyber threats to reinforce the EU
resilience of critical entities, in order to anticipate the future risk landscape, the increasingly
tight interdependencies between different sectors, and also the increasingly interdependent
relationships between physical and digital infrastructures.
➢ To create a resilient EU prepared for emerging threats, research and innovation will
enhance Europe’s disaster-resilience, including through actions to enhance pandemic
preparedness, e.g. by developing new broad spectrum anti-viral therapeutics for infectious
diseases with epidemic potential, and creating new knowledge to better understand the
relationship between infectious and non-communicable diseases. It will also support actions
aimed at improving preparedness for health emergencies. With a view to supporting the
European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA)’s objectives, this
work programme will promote investments in research to improve Europe’s preparedness
and ability to respond to serious cross-border threats to health.
➢ Finally, to foster inclusive growth and new job opportunities, research and innovation under
this work programme will help assessing and strengthening the complementarity between
new technologies and human skills; and tackling inequalities in the green and digital
transitions through specific topics.
22 E.g. .groups of people and/or patients vulnerable from a social, financial, or health perspective, or at risk of
discrimination, such as migrants, Roma people, trans and intersex people, specific age and gender groups (that
intersect with other aspects of vulnerability, such as elderly women), indigenous people, homeless people,
people in poverty or at risk of poverty, people with disabilities or patients with complex conditions.

General Introduction
The EU Missions
Horizon Europe has introduced the EU Missions as a new concept for the EU framework
programmes. EU Missions address some of the greatest global challenges that affect our daily lives.
They have ambitious, clear and targeted objectives that are time-bound, realistic and measurable.
They are rooted in research and innovation and they will employ a portfolio approach to tackle
these challenges using instruments across diverse disciplines and policy areas in a joined-up way.
With this work programme, the Commission launches an investment of more than €1 330 million
for 2023-2024. That investment will support research and innovation which is expected to result in,
for example, better prepared local and regional authorities to face climate-related risks, restorating
at least 25 000 km of free-flowing rivers, Climate City Contracts with 100 cities, the establishment of
100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils, optimised minimally-
invasive diagnostic cancer interventions and support to the physical and mental health of young
people who live with and beyond cancer. The actions included directly support key overarching EU
priorities such as the European Green Deal, a Europe fit for the Digital Age, the Europe’s Beating
Cancer Plan and an Economy that works for people.
Regulation (EU) 2021/695, Art. 8(5), set out than an assessment of the first missions established
under the Programme should take place no later than 2023 and before any decision is taken on
creating new missions, or on continuing, terminating or redirecting ongoing missions.
As a result of the exercise, the Commission Communication “EU Missions two years on: assessment
of progress and way forward” sets out the main findings of a thorough assessment of EU Missions
highlighting the main achievements of the current five individual Missions, while also identifying
challenges they have encountered, and sketches the way forward for this instrument.
The Commission invites researchers and innovators as well as citizens and all interested
stakeholders to take part in the five Missions:
Adaptation to Climate Change: support at least 150 European regions and local authorities to
become climate resilient by 2030.
This Mission is turning the urgent challenge of adapting to climate change into an opportunity to
make Europe resilient, fair and prepared to deal with climate disruptions, such as heatwaves,
drought, wildfires, floods or sea level rise. The Mission is accelerating adaptation efforts across
Europe, helping European regions and local authorities to adapt to climate change in smarter, faster
and more systemic way.
Cancer: improving the lives of more than 3 million people by 2030 through prevention, cure and
for those affected by cancer including their families, to live longer and better.
The Mission on Cancer supports Member States, regions and communities on cancer control, even
more so in light of the disruptive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. It will enhance understanding of
cancer, boost prevention, optimise diagnosis and treatment, improve quality of lives of patients and
their families and ensure equitable access to care across Europe. The Mission puts citizens,
including patients, at the centre of research and innovation, and research and innovation at the
centre of policy development. It contributes to the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan23, e.g. by
generating knowledge and evidence for the implementation of new actions in the areas of
23 eu_cancer-plan_en_0.pdf (europa.eu)

General Introduction
understanding, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and quality of life.
Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030
Man-made and climate-driven changes are putting our ocean and waters and consequently our
societies at a serious risk. The Mission’s new, systemic approach addresses the ocean and waters as
one and plays a key role in achieving climate neutrality and restoring nature. The aim of the Mission
is to contribute to preserving aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity by protecting 30% of the EU’s sea
area as well as to restoring marine eco-systems and 25.000 km of free flowing rivers, preventing
and eliminating pollution by reducing plastic litter at sea, nutrient losses and use of chemical
pesticides by 50% and to making the blue economy climate-neutral and circular with net-zero
maritime emissions.
Participatory approaches and citizen engagement, such as citizen science and ocean literacy actions,
are important elements of the Mission implementation. One of the key deliverables of the Mission
is the European Digital Twin of the Ocean that will make ocean knowledge readily available to
citizens, entrepreneurs, scientists, and policymakers. The stakeholders and citizens are further
mobilised through the Mission Charter, a simple, inclusive and inspirational framework, calling for
concrete actions to enhance cooperation to deliver on Mission objectives. By endorsing the Charter,
stakeholders are expressing strong support for the Mission and mobilising bottom-up actions and
resources. More than 500 actions were pledged in the first year of the Charter.
100 Climate neutral and smart cities by 2030
Producing more than 70% of global CO2 emissions, cities play a pivotal role in achieving climate
neutrality by 2050. Through the novel instrument of Climate City Contracts that closely involve
citizens and with dedicated support through the Mission Platform, 100 EU cities and 12 cities from
Associated Countries are being supported in their ambition to become climate-neutral by 2030.
They are leading in green and digital innovation and demonstrating solutions that will enable all
other European cities to follow suit by 2050.
A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils
by 2030
Life on Earth depends on healthy soils, but they are under threat, making us more vulnerable to
food insecurity and extreme weather events. The Mission is engaging with people (2 400 signatories
of the Mission Manifesto since its launch in April 2023) and creating effective partnerships across
sectors and territories to protect and restore soils. It contributes to Green Deal targets relating to
sustainable farming, climate resilience, biodiversity and zero-pollution through specific knowledge
generation on biodiversity, carbon farming, soil pollution and the circular economy. The Mission
provides support to the Commission’s proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience24
contributing to the development of a soil health monitoring framework. Its living labs will test and
scale-up innovative solutions for sustainable management of soil health on real-life settings,
mobilising additional funding to undertake the transtition towards healthy soils.
Supporting EU priorities through international cooperation in research and innovation
International cooperation in research and innovation is essential for tackling global challenges more
effectively and underpins all the key strategic orientations of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-
24 Proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience

General Introduction
2024. It also enables Europe to access resources, know-how, scientific excellence, value chains and
markets that are developing outside the EU.
In line with the EU global approach to research and innovation25, this work programme will tap into
the opportunities offered by international cooperation in order to maximise the impact of its actions.
It includes dedicated actions to support and strengthen cooperation through international initiatives
in areas such as renewable energies, global health, environmental observations, ocean- coastal and
arctic research, disaster management, and fair, healthy and environment-friendly food systems. It
also builds on the ambitious and comprehensive ‘Africa Initiative’ and introduces the
‘Mediterranean Initiative’, which identifies relevant topics across different clusters to respond to the
new R&I Agenda developed with the Union for the Mediterranean.
The openness of the work programme to international cooperation will be balanced with the need to
safeguard EU interests in strategic areas, in particular to promote the EU’s open strategic autonomy
and its technological leadership and competitiveness. In a limited number of cases for actions related
to Union strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security, actions will be limited to cooperation
between legal entities established in Member States only, Member States and Associated Countries,
and/or certain third countries. For duly justified and exceptional reasons, participation can also be
limited to legal entities established in the Union or in Associated Countries that are not directly or
indirectly controlled by non-associated third countries or by legal entities of non-associated third
countries, or make the participation of the controlled entities subject to conditions set out in the
work programme.
The EU is a front-runner of international openness in R&I, at the same time, international
cooperation can involve risks and challenges that must be taken into account. To support R&I actors
in mitigating such risks, the Commission has published a toolkit for tackling foreign interference in
R&I26. It is strongly recommended that participants in Horizon Europe actions familiarise themselves
with this publication and consider its relevance for the proposals they intend to submit.
Strengthening framework conditions for research and innovation
This work programme will also strengthen the framework conditions for research and innovation
within the EU by contributing to a stronger European research and innovation ecosystem, including
through wider participation, greater mobility for researchers and world class research
infrastructures.
The work programme part for Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) responds to Europe’s
continuing need for a highly-skilled and resilient human capital base in research and innovation that
can easily adapt to, and find sustainable solutions for, current and future challenges. The MSCA make
an important contribution by supporting researchers’ training and mobility through bottom-up and
excellence-driven research in the framework of doctoral networks, postdoctoral fellowships27, staff
exchanges and citizen outreach, thereby equipping researchers with new knowledge and skills and
providing them with international and inter-sectoral exposure. A special area of focus is providing

27 Aiming to enhance nuclear expertise and excellence as well as synergies between Horizon Europe and the
Euratom Research and Training Programme, nuclear researchers are eligible to participate in MSCA
Postdoctoral Fellowships supported by an annual financial contribution from the Euratom Research and
Training Programme.

General Introduction
researchers at risk with tailored support in their new geographical area. The MSCA also have a
structuring impact on higher education institutions and other R&I entities way beyond academia by
widely spreading excellence and setting standards for high-quality researcher education and training,
not only across the European Research Area (ERA) but also worldwide.
Europe’s research and innovation system depends on world-class research infrastructures that are
open and accessible to all researchers in Europe and beyond. Through the dedicated work
programme part, excellent research and breakthrough science and innovation will be supported with
cutting-edge, interconnected, specialised and sustainable Research Infrastructures. Special focus
areas will be the further development of the European Open Science Cloud, thereby supporting open
access to digital services for all European researchers; the support for access and integration of other
research infrastructures services, including in the field of health and the green and digital areas but
also to enable curiosity driven research in all scientific domains, and the development of the next
generation of scientific tools and solutions for research and innovation.
As also set out in the New European Innovation Agenda28, the urgent challenges of today are
inherently complex and systemic and will not be solved by individual actors or territories in isolation.
To foster enabling innovation ecosystems across Europe requires a systemic approach that is
inclusive and collaborative, involves diverse actors, institutions and places, maximises the value of
innovation to all and ensures equitable diffusion of its benefits. The work programme part on
European Innovation Ecosystems (EIE) supports concrete actions to help create interconnected,
inclusive and more efficient innovation ecosystems across Europe that draw on the existing strengths
of European, national, regional and local ecosystems and pulls in new, less well-represented
stakeholders and less advanced in innovation territories. Furthermore, it supports cooperation
between innovation players, for instance with actions aimed at strengthening cooperation between
academia and industry, or deep tech companies led by women. It also provides opportunities for
innovative SMEs cooperation with European and/or international partners through funding market-
led, cross-border, R&I collaborative projects and providing accompanying measures.
The European Research Area (ERA) foresees a single, borderless market for research, innovation and
technology across the EU based on excellent, competitive, open and talent driven research. Actions
on Open science, Citizen Science, Gender and Ethics as well as a broad spectrum of actions to
prioritise investments and reforms, improve access to excellence and reduce the research divide and
geographical disparities in research and innovation performance, translate R&I results into the
economy and deepen the ERA are presented in the current work programme part on Widening
participation and strengthening the European Research Area. The goal is to have a Union, where
knowledge and a highly skilled workforce circulate freely; where research outputs are shared rapidly
and efficiently; where researchers benefit from attractive careers and gender equality is ensured.
Ensuring continuity and bringing in new features
This work programme is shaped around the successes of and lessons learned from the work
programme 2021-2022 and EU’s previous research and innovation framework programmes. It
continues and builds on a number of key elements, such as open access to research data and results,
28 A New European Innovation Agenda: COM(2022) 332 final. See the communication here.
Page 16 of 21Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Introduction
which have proven their worth and relevance. It also features a number of important novelties
introduced with Horizon Europe to further streamline and enhance the programme:
Gender equality – Gender equality is a cross-cutting priority in Horizon Europe and concerns all
programme parts. The appropriate consideration of the gender dimension in research and innovation
content29 is mandatory for all applicants across the whole programme, unless the non-relevance of
sex and/or gender analysis is indicated at topic level. Furthermore, Horizon Europe is promoting
gender equality through sustainable institutional change by requesting that applicants (public bodies,
research organisations and higher education establishments) have in place a gender equality plan as
an eligibility criterion.
Widening participation - While keeping excellence as the main feature, a wide spectrum of measures
will foster participation in the work programme actions and facilitate collaborative links. For instance,
the ex-post ‘Hop on’ feature will allow existing project consortia to expand by including participants
from so-called ‘low R&I performing countries’, in order to build collaborative links and reduce the
research and innovation divide.
Synergies by design – The deployment and uptake of research results and innovative solutions
developed in this work programme, and Horizon Europe in general, will be facilitated in cooperation
with EU funding programmes. To foster synergies between Horizon Europe and other EU
programmes and policies, they are considered in the design of the work programmes, level, as well
as throughout all relevant implementation steps, such as project selection, management,
communication, dissemination and exploitation of results. For instance, a set of guidelines on new
opportunities to maximise the synergies between Horizon Europe and the European Regional
Development Fund programmes was published in July 2022.30
Social innovation – i.e. innovation for societal impact and innovation with citizens, academics,
entrepreneurs, and public administrators as co-designers, co-developers, and co-implementers is a
cross-cutting priority in Horizon Europe. Social innovation recognises the sociotechnical nature of all
innovations, benefits the need for society to own innovation, and serves the profound changes in
social practices required, inter alia, to achieve, the digital,energy and mobility transition, climate-
neutrality, sustainable management of natural resources, circularity, and greater societal resilience in
the face of health, climatic and other hazards.
Trustworthy technologies - All projects supported by this work programme will be in line with EU
values and adhere to the highest ethics and integrity standards. Horizon Europe is spearheading the
artificial intelligence ethics by design agenda. Due diligence will be required to make sure all AI-based
systems or techniques used or developed will be trustworthy: ethical, lawful and robust, with
particular attention to safety, accuracy, reliability and explainability.
29 Integrating the gender dimension in research and innovation content is an umbrella term for integrating sex
and/or gender analysis, that is, ensuring that the biological characteristics and the social/cultural features of
both women and men, as well as gender equality objectives, are taken into account as relevant in the content
of research and innovation projects. For more information see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/gendered-

General Introduction
What you will find in this work programme
Each part of this work programme, except for this Introduction, the MSCA part and the General
Annexes, is designed around a series of coherent packages of calls for proposals and impact-driven
destinations and topics.
Each destination describes socio-economic challenges to be addressed and the related expected
impacts that R&I activities will contribute to.
In many cases, destinations correspond directly to an expected impact identified in the Horizon
Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024, as shown in the overview below. Together, the destinations of this
work programme cover the 32 expected impacts in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024.
Under each destination, one or more topics describe the expected outcomes and the scope of the
research and innovation activities to be supported. The expected outcomes are the desired effects
of the project in the medium term such as the uptake, diffusion, use and/or deployment of the
project’s results by direct target groups. The scope describes the area of research/innovation that
needs to be tackled if the expected outcomes are to be successfully addressed, without prescribing
the method to achieve them. It is therefore up to the creativity and skill of the applicants to design a
project that will generate results and substantially contribute to the expected outcomes and impacts.
Each topic also sets out the general conditions, deadlines, budget, and any specific conditions that
may apply. The topics are grouped under calls for proposals, which is a technical term for a number
of topics that share the deadline for the opening of the topic for submission of applications.
The graphic below gives an overview of the relationship between policy priorities and project results
and explains the various terms used in this context.

B — Eligibility
Entities eligible to participate
Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-
associated third countries or international organisations (including international European
research organisations4) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not),
provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation5 have been met,
along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call/topic.
A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under
national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting
in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal
personality6.
Beneficiaries and affiliated entities must register in the Participant Register before submitting
their application, in order to get a participant identification code (PIC) and be validated by the
Central Validation Service before signing the grant agreement. For the validation, they will be
asked to upload the necessary documents showing their legal status and origin during the
grant preparation stage. A validated PIC is not a prerequisite for submitting an application.
For more information, see Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Specific cases:
Affiliated entities — Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a
beneficiary7 which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the
beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become
beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
Associated partners — Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action
without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim
contributions) are allowed, subject to any specific call/topic conditions.
Entities without legal personality — Entities which do not have legal personality under their
national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the
4 ‘International European research organisation’ means an international organisation, the majority of whose
members are Member States or Associated Countries, and whose principal objective is to promote scientific and
technological cooperation in Europe.

General Annexes
capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the
EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons8.
EU bodies — Legal entities created under EU law including decentralised agencies may be
part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
Joint Research Centre (‘JRC’)— Where provided for in the specific call/topic conditions,
applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC
will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate
the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text.
After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an
agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the
JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate
as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European
research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or
‘beneficiaries without legal personality’9. However, if the action is in practice implemented
by the individual members, those members should also participate either as beneficiaries or as
affiliated entities (otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible).
Restrictions on participation in Innovation Actions — In accordance with the 2019 “EU-
China - A Strategic outlook” communication, the 2021 “Global Approach to Research and
Innovation” communication, and the joint conclusions of the 4th EU-China Innovation
Cooperation Dialogue of 2019, an exercise to develop a Joint Roadmap for the future of EU-
China cooperation in science, technology, and innovation (Roadmap) has been established
between the EU and China. It has the objective to develop a level playing field for
engagement between the EU and China in the areas of science, technology, and innovation
(STI) that is respectful of fundamental research and innovation values and principles. This
endeavor is to be achieved through an agreement on the framework conditions contained in
the Roadmap and their monitoring and evaluation. As progress so far has mainly taken place
on the framework conditions linked to research rather than on those related to innovation, and
taking into account the nature and objectives in particular of Innovation Actions, cooperation
with entities established in China needs to be calibrated accordingly.
Legal entities established in China are therefore not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe
Innovation Actions in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated
entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or
recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-
by-case basis for justified reasons. The above eligibility criteria may be reviewed in the future
in accordance with policy developments. This exclusion is justified under Article 22(6) of the

Restrictions for the protection of European communication networks — The protection
of European communication networks has been identified as an important security interest of
the Union and its Member States.10 In line with the Commission Recommendation on the
cybersecurity of 5G networks of 201911 and the subsequent report on EU coordinated risk
assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G networks of 2019, 12 the EU Toolbox on 5G
cybersecurity,13 the second report on Member States’ progress in implementing the EU
toolbox on 5G cybersecurity of 2023,14 and the related Communication on the implementation
of the 5G cybersecurity toolbox of 2023,15 the Commission together with the Member States
has worked to jointly identify and assess cyberthreats and security risks for 5G networks.16
The toolbox also recommends adding country-specific information (e.g. threat assessment
from national security services, etc.). This work is an essential component of the Security
Union Strategy and supports the protection of electronic communications networks and other
critical infrastructures.
Entities assessed as “high-risk suppliers”, are currently set out in the second report on
Member States’ progress in implementing the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity of 202317 and
the related Communication on the implementation of the 5G cybersecurity toolbox of 202318.
The toolbox also underlines that further developing European capacities in the area of 5G and
post-5G technologies by leveraging EU Research & Innovation Funding programmes is a
strategic risk mitigating measure. This entails the need to avoid the participation of high-risk
supplier entities in the development of other technologies linked to the evolution of European
communication networks to prevent technology transfer and the persistence of dependencies
in materials, semiconductor components (including processors), computing resources,
software tools and virtualisation technologies, as well as related cybersecurity.
In order to protect the specific policy requirements of the Union and/or its Member States, it
is therefore appropriate that the following additional eligibility criteria apply to actions
identified as “subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication networks”
and to proposals within the MSCA part 19 that concern the evolution of European
communication networks (5G, post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of
European communication networks):

General Annexes
Entities that are assessed as high-risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment
(and any entities they own or control) are not eligible to participate as beneficiaries, affiliated
entities and associated partners.
The assessment is based on the following criteria:
• likelihood of interference from a non-associated third country, for example due to:
− the characteristics of the entity’s ownership or governance (e.g. state-owned or
controlled, government/party involvement);
− the characteristics of the entity’s business and other conduct (e.g. a strong link to a
third country government);
− the characteristics of the respective third country (e.g. legislation or government
practices likely to affect the implementation of the action, including an offensive
cyber/intelligence policy, pressure regarding place of manufacturing or access to
information).
• (cyber-)security practices, including throughout the entire supply chain;
• risks identified in relevant assessments of Member States and third countries as well as
other EU institutions, bodies and agencies, if relevant.
Exceptions may be requested from the granting authority and will be assessed case-by-case,
taking into account the criteria provided for in the 5G cybersecurity toolbox, the security risks
and availability of alternatives in the context of the action.
Restrictions on participation or control — For actions related to EU strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security, the specific topic conditions may limit participation to legal
entities established only in EU Member States or in EU Member States and specific
associated or non-associated third countries. In this case, the eligible countries will be
identified in the specific call/topic conditions. In addition, for duly justified and exceptional
reasons, to guarantee protection of the strategic interests of the EU and its Member States, the
specific call/topic conditions may also exclude the participation of legal entities directly or
indirectly controlled by non-eligible third countries or by legal entities of non-eligible third
countries (or make their participation subject to specific conditions), in line with Article 22(5)
of the Horizon Europe Regulation.
EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of
the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of
the EU (TFEU)20 as well as Article 75 TFEU21, are not eligible to participate in any capacity,
including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind
contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).

General Annexes
Special rules also apply to entities covered by Commission Guidelines No 2013/C 205/0522.
Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories
of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of
Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions
foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-
government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not
subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any
capacity23. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners,
third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to
third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the
rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506,
as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public
interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain.
Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals. However, as long as the
Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role
(beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third
parties, etc). In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or
replace that entity and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be
redistributed accordingly.

Legal entities which are established in countries not listed above will be eligible for funding if
provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered
essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
Specific cases:
Affiliated entities — Affiliated entities are eligible for funding if they are established in one
of the countries listed above, or in a country identified in the specific call/topic conditions.
Associated partners — Entities not eligible for funding (and therefore not able to participate
as beneficiaries) may participate as associated partners, unless specified otherwise in the
specific call/topic conditions.
Coordination and Support Actions – To be eligible to participate as beneficiaries (or
affiliated entities) in ‘Coordination and support’ actions, legal entities must be established in a
Member State or Associated Country, unless the specific call/topic conditions provide
otherwise (in which case the general rules for eligibility for funding apply). Legal entities
established in a non-associated third country may, however, participate in ‘Coordination and
support’ actions as associated partners, unless this is explicitly excluded by the specific
call/topic conditions.
EU bodies — Legal entities created under EU law may also be eligible to receive funding,
unless their basic act states otherwise.
International organisations — International European research organisations are eligible to
receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or
Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or
when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are
not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if
their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting
authority.
Consortium composition
Unless otherwise provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, only legal entities forming
a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as

beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a
different country as follows:
− at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
− at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member
States or Associated Countries.
As affiliated entities do not sign the grant agreement, they do not count towards the minimum
eligibility criteria for consortium composition (if any).
The Joint Research Centre, international European research organisations and legal entities
created under EU law are deemed to be established in a Member State other than those in
which the other legal entities participating in the action are established.
Applications for ‘Training and mobility’ actions and for ‘Programme co-fund’ actions may be
submitted by one or more legal entities, provided that one of those legal entities is established
in a Member State or an Associated Country.
Applications for ‘Coordination and support’ actions may be submitted by one or more legal
entities, which may be established in a Member State, Associated Country or, in exceptional
cases and if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, in another third country.
Applications for ‘Pre-commercial procurement’ actions and ‘Public procurement of
innovative solutions’ actions must also fulfil the eligibility criteria of three independent legal
entities as beneficiaries as explained above, out of which a minimum of two beneficiaries
must be independent legal entities that are public procurers29, each established in a different
Member State or Associated Country and with at least one of them established in a Member
State.
Eligible activities
Eligible activities are the ones described in the call conditions. Applications will only be
considered eligible if their content corresponds, wholly or in part, to the topic description for
which it is submitted.
Projects must focus exclusively on civil applications and must not:
– aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes;
– intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such changes
heritable (except for research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads, which may be
financed);
– intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research, or for the purpose
of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer.
29 ‘Public procurers’ are organisations that are contracting authorities or contracting entities as defined in EU
public procurement directives 2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU, and 2009/81/E.
Page 12 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Projects must, moreover, comply with EU policy interests and priorities (environment, social,
security, industrial policy, etc.).
The following activities are generally eligible for grants under Horizon Europe:
Research and innovation actions (RIA) — Activities that aim primarily to establish new
knowledge or to explore the feasibility of a new or improved technology, product, process,
service or solution. This may include basic and applied research, technology development and
integration, testing, demonstration and validation of a small-scale prototype in a laboratory or
simulated environment.
Innovation actions (IA) — Activities that aim directly to produce plans and arrangements or
designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services. These activities may
include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, large-scale product validation and
market replication.
Coordination and support actions (CSA) — Activities that contribute to the objectives of
Horizon Europe. This excludes research and innovation (R&I) activities, except those carried
out under the ‘Widening participation and spreading excellence’ component of the
programme (part of ‘Widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area’).
Also eligible are bottom-up coordination actions which promote cooperation between legal
entities from Member States and Associated Countries to strengthen the European Research
Area, and which receive no EU co-funding for research activities.
Programme co-fund actions (CoFund) — A programme of activities established or
implemented by legal entities managing or funding R&I programmes, other than EU funding
bodies. Such a programme of activities may support: networking and coordination; research;
innovation; pilot actions; innovation and market deployment; training and mobility;
awareness raising and communication; and dissemination and exploitation. It may also
provide any relevant financial support, such as grants, prizes and procurement, as well as
Horizon Europe blended finance30 or a combination thereof. The actions may be implemented
by the beneficiaries directly or by providing financial support to third parties.
Innovation and market deployment actions (IMDA) — Activities that embed an innovation
action and other activities necessary to deploy an innovation on the market. This includes the
scaling-up of companies and Horizon Europe blended finance.
Training and mobility actions (TMA) — Activities that aim to improve the skills, knowledge
and career prospects of researchers, based on mobility between countries and, if relevant,
between sectors or disciplines.
Pre-commercial procurement actions (PCP) — Activities that aim to help a transnational
buyers’ group to strengthen the public procurement of research, development, validation and,
30 ‘Horizon Europe blended finance’ means financial support for innovation and market deployment activities,
consisting of a specific combination of a grant or reimbursable advance and an investment in equity or any other
repayable form of support.

General Annexes
possibly, the first deployment of new solutions that can significantly improve quality and
efficiency in areas of public interest, while opening market opportunities for industry and
researchers active in Europe. Eligible activities include the preparation, management and
follow-up, under the coordination of a lead procurer, of one joint PCP and additional activities
to embed the PCP into a wider set of demand-side activities.
Public procurement of innovative solutions actions (PPI) — Activities that aim to
strengthen the ability of a transnational buyers’ group to deploy innovative solutions early by
overcoming the fragmentation of demand for such solutions and sharing the risks and costs of
acting as early adopters, while opening market opportunities for industry. Eligible activities
include preparing and implementing, under the coordination of a lead procurer, one joint or
several coordinated PPI by the buyers’ group and additional activities to embed the PPI into a
wider set of demand-side activities.
Technology Readiness Levels
Where the specific call/topic conditions require a Technology Readiness Level (TRL), the
following definitions apply, unless otherwise specified:
– TRL 1 — Basic principles observed
– TRL 2 — Technology concept formulated
– TRL 3 — Experimental proof of concept
– TRL 4 — Technology validated in a lab
– TRL 5 — Technology validated in a relevant environment (industrially relevant
environment in the case of key enabling technologies)
– TRL 6 — Technology demonstrated in a relevant environment (industrially relevant
environment in the case of key enabling technologies)
– TRL 7 — System prototype demonstration in an operational environment
– TRL 8 — System complete and qualified
– TRL 9 — Actual system proven in an operational environment (competitive
manufacturing in the case of key enabling technologies, or in space)
Ethics
Projects must comply with ethical principles (including the highest standards of research
integrity) and applicable EU, international and national law.
Applicants must have completed the ethics self-assessment as part of their application.
For more information, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment.
Page 14 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Projects involving ethics issues will have to undergo an ethics review to authorise funding and
may be made subject to specific ethics requirements. These requirements become part of the
grant agreement as ethics deliverables, e.g. ethics committee opinions/authorisations required
under national or EU law.
Security — EU classified and sensitive information
Projects involving classified and/or sensitive information will have to go through the security
appraisal process to authorise funding and may be made subject to specific security rules
(detailed in the Security Section, which is annexed to the grant agreement). Specific
provisions for EU classified information (EUCI) and sensitive information (SEN) will be
included in the grant agreement, as necessary and appropriate.
The rules for protecting EU classified information (governed by Commission Decision (EU,
Euratom) 2015/44431 and/or national rules) provide for instance that:
− projects involving information classified as TRES SECRET UE/EU TOP SECRET (or
equivalent) can NOT be funded;
− EU classified information must be marked in accordance with the applicable security
instructions in the Security Classification Guide appendix of the Security Aspects
Letter (SAL), which is contained in the Security Section of the grant agreement;
− generation of, or access to, information with classification levels CONFIDENTIEL
UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL or above (and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, if
required by national rules) may take place only on the premises of entities which have
been granted a facility security clearance (FSC) issued by the competent national
security authority (NSA);
− handling of information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL or
above (and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, if required by national rules) may
take place only in a secured area accredited by the competent NSA;
− access to and handling of information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU
CONFIDENTIAL or above may be granted only to individuals with a valid personnel
security clearance (PSC) and an established need-to-know, who have been briefed on
the applicable security rules;
− access to, and handling of, information classified RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED
may be granted only to individuals who have a need-to-know and have been briefed
on the applicable security rules;
− at the end of the grant, the classified information must either be returned or continue to
be protected according to the applicable rules;
31 See Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p. 53).
Page 15 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
− subcontracting of tasks involving EU classified information is subject to prior written
approval by the European Commission, which is the originator of EU classified
information. It is only possible to subcontract these tasks to entities established in an
EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of information agreement
with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the Commission);
− disclosure of EU classified information is subject to prior written approval by the
European Commission.
Depending on the type of activity, FSCs may have to be provided before the grant is signed.
The granting authority will assess this for each case and fix the delivery date during the grant
preparation stage. It is not possible to sign any grant agreement before at least one of the
beneficiaries in the consortium has an FSC.
In certain cases, the project results might not require classification, but they might be sensitive
and require restricted disclosure or limited dissemination for security reasons, according to the
applicable instructions in the Security Section. This means that, in principle, third parties
should have no access to results subject to this type of restriction. Disclosure of this
information is subject to prior written approval by the European Commission.
Further security recommendations may be added to the grant agreement in the form of
security deliverables (e.g. establishing a security advisory board, appointing a project security
officer, limiting the level of detail, using a fake scenario, etc.).
In addition, beneficiaries must ensure that their projects are not subject to national/third-
country security requirements that could affect implementation or put into question the award
of the grants (e.g. technology restrictions, national security classification, etc.). Any potential
security issues must be notified immediately to the granting authority.
Gender equality plans and gender mainstreaming
Beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities between men and women
in implementing the action and, where applicable, in line with their gender equality plan.
They must aim to achieve, to the extent possible, a gender balance at all levels of personnel
assigned to the action, including at supervisory and managerial level.
In addition, to be eligible, legal entities from Member States and Associated Countries that
are public bodies, research organisations or higher education establishments (including private
research organisations and higher education establishments) must have a gender equality plan,
covering the following minimum process-related requirements:
– publication: a formal document published on the institution’s website and signed by
the top management;
– dedicated resources: commitment of resources and expertise in gender equality to
implement the plan;
Page 16 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
– data collection and monitoring: sex/gender disaggregated data on personnel (and
students, for the establishments concerned) and annual reporting based on indicators;
– training: awareness raising/training on gender equality and unconscious gender biases
for staff and decision-makers.
Content-wise, it is recommended that the gender equality plan addresses the following areas,
using concrete measures and targets:
– work-life balance and organisational culture;
– gender balance in leadership and decision-making;
– gender equality in recruitment and career progression;
– integration of the gender dimension into research and teaching content;
– measures against gender-based violence, including sexual harassment.
A self-declaration will be requested at proposal stage. If all the above-mentioned mandatory
requirements are met through another strategic document, such as a development plan or an
inclusion or diversity strategy, it can be considered as an equivalent. This eligibility criterion
does not apply to other categories of legal entities, such as private for-profit organisations,
including SMEs, non-governmental or civil society organisations.
Financial support to third parties
Where the specific call/topic conditions allow for financial support to third parties, the
applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results,
including the elements listed in the application template. The following conditions must also
be fulfilled:
– projects must publish their open calls widely and adhere to EU standards of
transparency, equal treatment, conflict of interest and confidentiality;
– all calls for third parties and all calls that are implemented by third parties must be
published on the Funding & Tenders Portal, and on the beneficiaries’ websites;
– the calls must remain open for at least 2 months;
– if submission deadlines are changed, this must immediately be announced and
registered applicants must be informed of the change;
– projects must publish the outcome of the calls without delay, including a description
of third-party projects, the date of the award, the duration, and the legal name of the
third party and country of establishment;
– the calls must have a clear European dimension.
Further conditions may be stipulated in the specific conditions for the topic.

OTHER TYPES OF ACTIONS AND FORMS OF FUNDING
The following types of action and forms of funding are also used in Horizon Europe. They are usually placed in the
‘Other Actions’ section of the work programme parts and are not all subject to calls for proposals.
• Grants to identified beneficiaries — Exceptionally, a grant may be awarded to legal entities explicitly named
in the work programme without a prior call for proposals. The identified beneficiaries must nevertheless submit
a proposal to benefit from funding. This proposal will be evaluated and must meet the required threshold. The
funding rates will correspond to the type of action indicated.
• Prizes — Prize means a financial contribution given as a reward following a contest. Inducement prizes: a prize
to stimulate investment in a given area, by specifying a goal prior to the work being performed. Contests for
inducement prizes must address technological and/or societal challenges. The award criteria will define a goal,
but without prescribing how to achieve it. Contests for inducement prizes are split into awards for the contestant
that first meets the specific goal defined in the rules of the contest, and awards for the best contestant within a
given period. Recognition prizes: a prize to reward past achievements and outstanding work after it has been
performed. Recognition prizes must help to raise public awareness of EU policies, create role models and
support best practice exchange. The Rules of the contest of a specific prize provide for the admissibility,
eligibility, exclusion and award criteria, the prize amount and categories (if applicable) the evaluation
procedure, the indicative timetable and the modalities of payment. The rules are found on the call topic page on
the Funding & Tenders Portal.
• Framework partnerships and specific grant agreements — Framework partnerships are formalised long-
term cooperation mechanisms involving several or recurring grants. They must be based on jointly agreed action
plans and agreements that set out the terms and conditions for receiving grants to implement the actions,
framework partnership agreements (FPA) and specific grant agreements (SGA). The FPA will set out the
framework conditions governing potential grants to beneficiaries on the basis of an action plan and jointly
agreed general objectives. The SGA will set out the specific obligations and conditions to implement the
specific action. The FPA will have no budget; the budget and rules on funding will be set out in each SGA and
depend on the specific type of action. The establishment of an FPA must take place following a call for
proposals. Beneficiaries will be identified from the evaluation of the proposals. In a subsequent step,
beneficiaries may be invited to submit their proposals for the SGA. Framework partnerships do not give the
partners (i.e. potential beneficiaries) exclusive rights to be awarded the grants covered by the FPAs. SGAs must
only be signed if the FPA has been signed, and before the end date of the FPA.
• Operating grants — Operating grants provide financial support for the functioning of a body to enable it to
carry out specific activities set out in the agreed work programme. Operating grants do not support the
implementation of a specific action, but rather the annual operating budget (or part of it) for certain bodies
whose statutory activities serve the strategic objectives of EU policies. Operating grants will always be mono-
beneficiary grants supporting the work programme of only one organisation. Operating grants must follow the
same rules as described in Annex G, but they do not differentiate between direct and indirect costs. Receiving
an operating grant may make beneficiaries ineligible to receive indirect costs in all other EU action grants.
• Public procurement — In a public procurement action, the granting authority purchases works, supplies or
services, or acquires or rents land, buildings or other immovable property. This is done by entering into a
contract with an economic operator chosen by the granting authority. Before the granting authority enters into a
procurement contract, a call for tender is published on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
• Expert contract actions — Expert contracts are used to appoint independent expert(s) to advise or assist us.
Experts are used for evaluating proposals, for evaluating the programme, for ethics screenings and assessments,
for advisory bodies, and for expertise related to the objectives of Horizon Europe.
• Subscription actions — Subscription actions are used to pay contributions to bodies in which the EU is a
member or an observer.
• Scientific and technical services by the Joint Research Centre — Scientific and technical services cover
research and innovation activities undertaken by the Commission through its Joint Research Centre. These (non-
nuclear) activities are direct actions generating high-quality scientific evidence to support efficient and
affordable public policies. Horizon Europe’s rules for participation do not apply to these actions.
• Indirectly managed actions — Indirectly managed actions refer to actions implemented by entities which are
entrusted with implementing EU funds or budgetary guarantees through a contribution agreement.
• Service level agreement actions — These are actions implemented through a service level agreement. Service
level agreements include agreements between Commission departments or, agreements that the Commission
may conclude with another Union institution, Union body, or European office involving the provision of
services.

General Annexes
C — Financial and operational capacity and exclusion
Financial capacity
Applicants must have stable and sufficient resources to successfully implement the projects
and contribute their share. Organisations participating in several projects must have sufficient
capacity to implement all these projects.
The financial capacity check will be done on the basis of the documents uploaded in the
Participant Register during the grant preparation stage (e.g. profit and loss account and
balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an approved external auditor, certifying
the accounts for the last closed financial year, etc.). The analysis will be based on neutral
financial indicators, but will also take into account other aspects, such as dependency on EU
funding and deficit and revenue in previous years.
The check will normally be done for the coordinator if the requested grant amount is equal to
or greater than EUR 500 000, except for:
− public bodies (entities established as a public body under national law, including local,
regional or national authorities) or international organisations; and
− cases where the individual requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60 000 (low-
value grant).
If needed, it may also be done for the other applicants, including affiliated entities. If the
financial capacity is structurally guaranteed by another legal entity, the financial capacity of
that legal entity will be verified.
If the granting authority considers that the financial capacity is not satisfactory, they may
require:
− further information;
− an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility of
affiliated entities (see Annex G below); and
− prefinancing paid in instalments;
or
− propose no prefinancing;
− request that the applicant concerned is replaced or, if needed, reject the entire
proposal.
For more information, see Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Page 20 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Operational capacity
Applicants must have the know-how, qualifications and resources to successfully
implement their tasks in the project and contribute their share (including, when appropriate,
sufficient experience in EU/transnational projects of comparable size).
This assessment of operational capacity will be carried out during the evaluation of the award
criterion ‘Quality and efficiency of the implementation’. It will be based on the competence
and experience of the applicants and their project teams, including their operational resources
(human, technical and other) or, exceptionally, the measures proposed to obtain the necessary
competence and experience by the time the tasks are implemented.
If the evaluation of this award criterion leads to a score above the applicable threshold, then
the applicants are considered to have sufficient operational capacity.
For this assessment, applicants will be required to provide the following information in the
application form:
− description of the consortium participants; and
− for each participant:
– identity of researchers involved in the proposal (through the researchers table);
– up to five most relevant publications, widely-used datasets, software, goods,
services, or any other achievements relevant to the call content;
– up to five most relevant previous projects or activities, connected to the subject
of this proposal; and
– description of any significant infrastructure and/or any major items of technical
equipment, relevant to the proposed work.
Additional supporting documents may be requested if they are needed to confirm the
operational capacity of any applicant.
Public bodies, Member State organisations and international organisations are exempted from
the operational capacity check.
Exclusion
Applicants that are subject to EU administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion)32 or are in one of
the following exclusion situations33 that bar them from receiving EU grants can NOT
participate:
32 See Article 136 EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.

− they have created under a different jurisdiction an entity with the intent to circumvent
fiscal, social or other legal obligations in the country of origin or created another entity
with this purpose (including if done by persons having powers of representation,
decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the
award/implementation of the grant).
Applicants will also be refused if they35:
− have misrepresented the information required as a condition for participating in the
procedure or have failed to supply that information; or
− were previously involved in the preparation of documents used in the award procedure
where this entails a breach of the principle of equality of treatment, including
distortion of competition, that cannot be remedied otherwise.

Scores and weighting
Evaluation scores will be awarded for the criteria, and not for the different aspects listed in the
table. For full applications, each criterion will be scored out of 5. The threshold for individual
criteria will be 3. The overall threshold, applying to the sum of the three individual scores,
will be 10.
To determine the ranking for ‘Innovation actions’, the score for ‘Impact’ will be given a
weight of 1.5.
Proposals that pass the individual threshold AND the overall threshold will be considered for
funding, within the limits of the available call budget. Other proposals will be rejected.
Two-stage calls
For the evaluation of first-stage applications under a two-stage submission procedure, only the
‘Excellence’ and ‘Impact’ criteria will be evaluated. Within these criteria, only the aspects in
bold will be considered.
The threshold for both individual criteria will be 4. For each indicative budget-split in the call
conditions, the overall threshold applying to the sum of the two individual scores will be set at
a level that ensures the total requested budget of proposals admitted to stage 2 is as close as
possible to three times the available budget, and not less than two and a half times the
available budget. The actual level will therefore depend on the volume of proposals received.
The threshold is expected normally to be set at 8 or 8.5.
The evaluation procedure is explained further in Annex F below.
Page 26 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
E — Documents
Submission
All proposals must be submitted electronically via the Funders & Tenders Portal electronic
submission system (accessible via the topic page in the Search Funding & Tenders section).
Paper submissions are NOT possible.
Proposals must be complete and contain all parts and mandatory annexes and supporting
documents.
The application form will have two parts:
– Part A (to be filled in directly online) contains administrative information about the
applicant organisations (future coordinator and beneficiaries and affiliated entities),
the summarised budget for the proposal and call-specific questions;
– Part B (to be downloaded from the Portal submission system, completed and then
assembled and re-uploaded as a PDF in the system) contains the technical description
of the project.
Annexes and supporting documents will be directly available in the submission system and
must be uploaded as PDF files (or other formats allowed by the system).
Proposals should be designed to stay as close as possible to the award criteria (see Annex D
above). The application form will help to achieve this.
When submitting the proposal, the coordinator will have to confirm that they have the
mandate to act for all applicants. Moreover, they will have to confirm that the information in
the application is correct and complete and that all participants comply with the conditions for
receiving EU funding (especially eligibility, financial and operational capacity, exclusion,
etc.). Proposals not complying with these requirements will be rejected. Before signing the
grant, each participant will have to confirm this again by signing a declaration of honour.
For lump sum grants proposals, the estimated budget must be described in a detailed budget
table. This will be used as a basis for justifying and/or fixing the lump sum amount. As the
lump sum must be an approximation of the costs actually incurred, the costs included in this
detailed budget table must comply with the basic eligibility conditions for EU actual cost
grants (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, Article 6). This is particularly important for
purchases and subcontracting, which must ensure best value for money (or, if appropriate, the
lowest price) and be free from any conflicts of interest. If the budget table contains ineligible
costs, the grants may be reduced (even later on during implementation of the project or after
they end). Exceptionally, the Decision authorising the use of lump sum funding for a specific
action might specify that a detailed budget table is not required.
Applicants may be asked at a later stage for further documents (for legal entity validation,
financial capacity check, bank account validation, etc.).
Page 27 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
F — Procedure
Evaluation procedure and ranking
Calls may be subject to either a single-stage submission procedure or a two-stage
submission procedure. The evaluation procedure may be organised in one (standard) or
several steps.
In the first stage of a two-stage submission, applicants will be requested to submit only an
outline application (which will be evaluated against only two award criteria: ‘Excellence’ and
‘Impact’). Successful applicants will be invited to submit a full application for the second
stage (which will be evaluated against the full set of award criteria).
Proposals will be checked for formal requirements (admissibility and eligibility) and then
evaluated (for each topic separately) by an evaluation committee composed of independent
external experts for operational capacity and award criteria (see Annexes C and D above) and
then ranked according to their quality score.
For lump sum grants proposals, comments on the detailed lump sum budget table will be
provided in the Evaluation Summary Report only for proposals invited to grant agreement
preparation (or placed in the reserve list) and ones rejected (in part) due to significant
overestimation or underestimation of costs.
Exceptionally, where indicated in the specific call/topic conditions, the evaluation committee
may be composed partially or, in the case of ‘Coordination and support actions’, partially or
fully of representatives of EU institutions.
For proposals with the same score within a single budget envelope (with the exception of the
first stage of two-stage submissions) a method to establish the priority order will be
determined, taking into consideration the objectives of the specific topic. In the absence of
special arrangements in the specific call/topic conditions, the following method will apply:
For each group of proposals with the same score, starting with the group achieving the highest
score and continuing in descending order:
1) Proposals that address aspects of the call that have not otherwise been covered by
more highly ranked proposals will be considered to have the highest priority.
2) The proposals identified under 1), if any, will themselves be prioritised according to
the scores they have been awarded for ‘Excellence’. When these scores are equal,
priority will be based on scores for ‘Impact’. In the case of ‘Innovation actions’,
priority will be given to the score for ‘Impact’, followed by that for ‘Excellence’.
3) If necessary, the gender balance among the researchers named in the researchers table
in the proposal, will be used as a factor for prioritisation.
4) If necessary, any further prioritisation will be based on geographical diversity, defined
as the number of Member States or Associated Countries represented in the proposal,
Page 28 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
not otherwise receiving funds from projects higher up the ranking list (and if equal in
number, then by budget).
5) If a distinction still cannot be made, the panel may decide to further prioritise by
considering other factors related to the objectives of the call, or to Horizon Europe in
general. These may include, for example, enhancing the quality of the project portfolio
through synergies between projects or, where relevant and feasible, involving SMEs.
These factors will be documented in the panel report.
6) The method described in 1), 2), 3) and 4) will then be applied to the remaining equally
ranked proposals in the group.
At the end of the evaluation, all applicants will be informed of the result in an evaluation
result letter. Successful proposals will be invited to the next stage, ‘grant preparation’; the
other proposals will be put on the reserve list or rejected.
No commitment to provide funding — Invitation to the grant preparation stage does NOT
constitute a formal commitment to funding. Various legal checks are still needed before the
grant can be awarded, such as legal entity validation, financial capacity verification, exclusion
check, etc.
If indicated in the specific call/topic conditions, proposals which were judged to deserve
funding but did not succeed because of budget limits will receive a Seal of Excellence37. With
prior authorisation from the applicant, the granting authority may share information
concerning the proposal and the evaluation with interested financing authorities, subject to the
conclusion of confidentiality agreements.
Budget flexibility — The budgets set out in the calls and topics are indicative. Unless
otherwise stated, final budgets may change following evaluation. The final figures may
change by up to 20% compared to the total budget indicated in each individual part of the
work programme. Changes within these limits will not be considered substantial within the
meaning of Article 110(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 2018/1046.
Joint calls for proposals — In cases of applications for joint calls with third countries
(including scientific and technological organisations or agencies from third countries),
international organisations or non-profit legal entities, the joint selection and evaluation
procedures will be indicated in the specific call/topic conditions.
Blind evaluation pilot – If indicated in the specific call/topic conditions, first-stage
proposals of two-stage submissions will be evaluated blindly38 and applicants must not
disclose their identity in Part B of their proposal (see Annex A above).
Evaluation review procedure
37 https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/seal-excellence_en.
38 See Horizon Europe Programme Guide for further details.
Page 29 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
If the consortium believes that the evaluation procedure was flawed, the coordinator can
submit a complaint (following the deadlines and procedures also set out in the evaluation
result letter).
Only the procedural aspects of an evaluation may be the subject of a request for an evaluation
review. The evaluation of the merits of a proposal will not be the subject of an evaluation
review.
A request for an evaluation review must relate to a specific proposal and must be submitted
within 30 days after the beneficiary accesses the evaluation results. The deadlines will be
counted from the date of opening/access. The maximum size limit of the request is 7 000
characters. Notifications of evaluation results which have not been opened in the Funding &
Tenders Portal within 10 days after sending are considered to have been accessed (see also
Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions).
An evaluation review committee will provide an opinion on the procedural aspects of the
evaluation. The evaluation review committee may recommend a re-evaluation of the proposal,
to be carried out primarily by evaluators who were not involved in the previous evaluation, or
a confirmation of the initial evaluation.
Indicative timetable for evaluation and for signature of the grant agreement
Unless otherwise stated in the specific call/topic conditions, the timing for evaluation and
grant preparation is as follows:
– information on the outcome of the evaluation: around 5 months from the deadline for
submission;
– indicative date for the signing of grant agreements: around 8 months from the deadline
for submission.
For two-stage calls, the timing is different (for the evaluation result: around 3 months from
the deadline for submission for the first stage, and around 5 months from the deadline for
submission for the second stage, for signature of the grant agreement around 8 months from in
the second stage deadline for submission).
Page 30 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
G — Legal and financial set-up of the grant agreements
During the grant preparation stage, the consortium will be asked to prepare the grant
agreement, together with the EU project officer.
This grant agreement will set out the framework for the grant and its terms and conditions,
particularly concerning deliverables, reporting and payments. The applicable model with the
complete text of the provisions is available on the topic page, together with the other call
documentation.
Starting date & project duration
The project starting date and duration will be fixed in the grant agreement (see Data Sheet,
point 1). Normally, the starting date will be after the grant has been signed. A starting date
before the date the grant is signed (retroactive) can be granted exceptionally for duly justified
reasons, if agreed with the granting authority39.
The project duration is provided in months (extensions will be possible only exceptionally, for
duly justified reasons and if the granting authority agrees).
Milestones and deliverables
The milestones and deliverables for each project will be managed through the grant
management system in the Portal and are reflected in Annex 1 of the grant agreement.
The standard deliverables will be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
Form of grant, funding rate and maximum grant amount
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be
fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 3 and Article 5).
The project budget is provided in EUR. The amount of the grant awarded may be lower than
the amount requested.
For actual cost grants, the grant will be a budget-based, mixed actual cost grant. This means
that it will reimburse ONLY certain types of costs (eligible costs) and ONLY those costs
actually incurred for the project (NOT the budgeted costs).
The costs will be reimbursed at the funding rate fixed in the specific call/topic conditions and
in the grant agreement.
Such grants may NOT produce a profit. If there is a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU grant
over costs), it will be deducted from the final grant amount.
Moreover, the final grant amount may be reduced in case of non-compliance (e.g. improper
implementation, breach of obligations, etc.).
39 See Article 193 EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
Page 31 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
The maximum Horizon Europe funding rates are as follows:
– Research and innovation action: 100%
– Innovation action: 70% (except for non-profit legal entities, where a rate of up to
100% applies)
– Coordination and support action: 100%
– Programme co-fund action: between 30% and 70%
– Innovation and market deployment: 70% (except for non-profit legal entities, where a
rate of up to 100% applies)
– Training and mobility action: 100%
– Pre-commercial procurement action: 100%
– Public procurement of innovative solutions action: 50%
Other funding rates may be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
For lump sum and unit grants, the funding rate is already applied as part of the
methodology for fixing the amounts and is therefore not shown in the grant agreement.
Budget categories and cost eligibility rules
The budget categories and cost eligibility rules are fixed in the grant agreement (see Data
Sheet, point 3 and Article 6).
Budget categories:
– actual costs (i.e. costs which are real and not estimated or budgeted) for:
– personnel costs (unless declared as a unit cost; see below);
– subcontracting costs;
– purchase costs (unless declared as a unit cost; see below); and
– costs of providing financial support to third parties (if provided for in the
specific call conditions);
– units (i.e. an amount per unit) for:
– personnel costs of SME owners/natural persons not receiving a salary;
– personnel costs calculated by the beneficiaries according to their usual cost
accounting practices (average personnel costs);
– costs of internally invoiced goods and services calculated by the beneficiaries
according to their usual cost accounting practices; and
Page 32 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
– specific unit costs (if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions; see also
Annex 2a of the grant agreement);
– flat-rate (i.e. costs calculated by applying a percentage fixed in advance to other types
of eligible costs) for:
– indirect costs (25% flat-rate of the total eligible direct costs, excluding eligible
direct costs for subcontracting, financial support to third parties and any unit
costs or lump sums which include indirect costs);
– lump sum (i.e. a global amount deemed to cover all costs of the action or a specific
category of costs, if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions).
Within a grant, different forms of costs can be used.
Costs can also be declared under several EU Synergy grants, if the cumulative funding under
the grants does not exceed 100% of the eligible costs and the contributions declared to them.
Reporting & payment arrangements
The reporting and payment arrangements are fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 4
and articles 21 and 22).
After the grant has been signed, the consortium will normally receive a float to start working
on the project (normally, pre-financing of 160% of the average EU funding per reporting
period (i.e. maximum grant amount/number of periods); exceptionally, less or no pre-
financing). For actions with only one reporting period, it will be less, since 100% would mean
the totality of the grant amount.
Programme co-fund actions may receive additional pre-financing payments.
Payments will be automatically lowered if one of the consortium members has outstanding
debts towards the EU (granting authority or other EU bodies). Such debts will be offset by the
granting authority, in line with the conditions set out in the grant agreement (see Article 22).
At the moment of the prefinancing payment, an amount ranging from 5% to 8% of the
maximum grant amount will be deducted from the prefinancing payment and transferred to
the mutual insurance mechanism. This mechanism covers the risks associated with non-
recovery of sums due from the beneficiaries.
There will be one or several interim payments linked to a periodic report, depending on the
duration of the project.
At the end of the project, the consortium will be invited to submit a report on the basis of
which the final grant amount will be calculated. If the total of earlier payments is higher than
the final grant amount, the beneficiaries concerned (or the coordinator) will be asked to pay
back the difference (recovery).
Certificates
Page 33 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Depending on the size of the grant amount and on the type of beneficiaries, beneficiaries may
be required to submit a certificate on the financial statements. The thresholds for this
certificate are fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 4 and Article 24).
Liability regime for recoveries
The liability regime for recoveries is that of individual financial responsibility. Each
beneficiary is liable only for their own debt (and those of its affiliated entities, if any) (Data
Sheet point 4.4 and Article 22).
Provisions concerning project implementation
– Proper implementation of the action (Article 11).
– Conflict of interest (Article 12).
– Confidentiality and security (EU classified information) (Article 13 and Annex 5).
– Ethics (research integrity) and values (gender mainstreaming) (Article 14 and Annex
5).
– Data protection (Article 15).
– Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), background and results, access rights and rights of
use (Article 16 and Annex 5). In addition to the standard provisions, the following
specific provisions in the model grant agreement will apply to all grants awarded
under this work programme:
Additional exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency: If
requested by the granting authority, beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive
licences to their results – for a limited period of time specified in the request
and on fair and reasonable conditions – to legal entities that need the results to
address the public emergency. These legal entities must commit to rapidly and
broadly exploiting the resulting products and services on fair and reasonable
conditions. This provision will apply up to 4 years after the end of the action.
Additional information obligation relating to standards: Unless stated
otherwise in the specific call conditions, beneficiaries must, up to 4 years after
the end of the action, inform the granting authority if the results could
reasonably be expected to contribute to European or international standards.
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing — Horizon
Europe actions: The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the
action, object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results,
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5.
– Communication, dissemination, open science and visibility (Article 17 and Annex 5).
In addition to the standard provisions, the following specific provisions in the model
grant agreement will apply to all grants awarded under this work programme:
Page 34 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Open science - additional practices, validation of scientific publications:
Beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access to data or other results
needed to validate the conclusions of scientific publications, to the extent that
their legitimate interests or constraints are safeguarded (and unless they
already provided the (open) access at publication).
Open science - additional practices, public emergency: In case of a public
emergency, if requested by the granting authority, beneficiaries must
immediately deposit any research output in a repository and provide open
access to it under a CC BY licence, a public domain dedication (CC 0) or
equivalent.
As an exception, if providing open access would be against the beneficiaries’
legitimate interests, the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences, on fair
and reasonable conditions, to legal entities that need the research output to
address the public emergency. These legal entities must commit to rapidly and
broadly exploiting the resulting products and services on fair and reasonable
conditions. This exception is limited to 4 years after the end of the action.
– Specific rules for carrying out the action (Article 18 and Annex 5).
Other provisions may be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
Non-compliance and breach of contract
The grant agreement (Chapter 5) provides for the measures that may be taken in case of
breach of contract (and other violations of law).

General Annexes
IMPORTANT
• Do not wait until the end — Complete the application sufficiently in advance of the deadline to avoid any
last minute technical problems. Problems due to last-minute submissions (e.g. congestion, etc.) will be
entirely at applicants’ own risk. Call deadlines can NOT be extended at the request of applicants.
• Consult the topic page on the Portal regularly. The granting authority will use it to publish updates and
additional information on the call (call updates).
• Funding & Tenders Portal electronic exchange system — By submitting the application, all applicants
accept to use the electronic exchange system in accordance with the Portal Terms & Conditions.
• Registration — Before submitting the application, all beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated partners
must be registered in the Participant Register. The participant identification code (PIC) (one per participant)
is mandatory for the application form. For validation, beneficiaries and affiliated entities will be requested to
upload the necessary documents showing their legal status and origin during the grant preparation stage.
Associated partners do not need validation.
• Consortium roles — When setting up the consortium, applicants should think of organisations that can help
them reach objectives and solve problems.
The roles should be attributed according to the degree of participation of each participant in the project. Main
participants should participate as beneficiaries or affiliated entities; other entities may participate as
associated partners, subcontractors, or third parties giving in-kind contributions, provided that the related
conditions are fulfilled. Associated partners and third parties giving in-kind contributions should bear their
own costs (they will not become formal recipients of EU funding). Subcontracting should normally constitute
a limited part and must be performed by third parties (not by one of the beneficiaries/affiliated entities, see
section G).
• Coordinator — In multi-beneficiary grants, the beneficiaries participate as a consortium (group of
beneficiaries). They will have to choose a coordinator among them, who will manage and coordinate the
project and will represent the consortium towards the granting authority. In mono-beneficiary grants, the
single beneficiary will automatically be the coordinator.
• Affiliated entities — Applicants may participate with affiliated entities. Affiliated entities will get a part of
the EU funding and must therefore comply with all the call conditions (just like beneficiaries). But they do
not sign the grant agreement and do not count towards the minimum eligibility criteria for consortium
composition (if any).
• Associated partners — Applicants may participate with associated partners. They participate without
funding and without signing the grant agreement and therefore do not need to be validated.
• Consortium agreement — For practical and legal reasons, participants must conclude a written consortium
agreement to ensure the smooth and successful implementation of the action and to deal with exceptional or
unforeseen circumstances, unless otherwise provided for in the specific call conditions. The consortium
agreement also gives the possibility to redistribute the EU funding according to internal consortium
principles and arrangements (for instance, one beneficiary can reattribute their grant share to another
beneficiary). The consortium agreement thus allows the grant to be customised to the needs of the consortium
and can also help to protect the members in case of disputes. Consortium agreements are not required for
mono-beneficiary projects.
• Completed/ongoing projects — Applications for projects that have already been completed will be rejected.
Applications for projects that have already started will be assessed on a case-by-case basis (in such cases, no
costs can normally be reimbursed for activities that took place before the application was submitted).
Page 36 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
• No-profit rule — Grants may NOT give a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU grant over costs). This will
be checked by the granting authority at the end of the project.
• No double funding — There is strict prohibition of double funding from the EU budget. Any given action
may receive only ONE grant from the EU budget (except for EU Synergy grants) and same costs may
under NO circumstances be declared to two different EU actions.
• Combination with EU operating grants — Combination with EU operating grants is possible, if the
project remains outside the operating grant work programme and the beneficiary makes sure that cost items
are clearly separated in its accounting and NOT declared twice (see AGA — Annotated Model Grant
Agreement, Article 6.2.E).
• Multiple applications — Applicants may submit more than one application for different projects under the
same call (and be awarded funding for them).
Organisations may participate in several applications.
BUT: if there are several applications for the same/very similar project, only one application will be
accepted and evaluated.
• Language — Applicants can submit their application in any official EU language. However, for reasons of
efficiency, it is strongly advised to use English. If applicants need the call documentation in another
official EU language, they must submit a request within 10 days after publication of the call (for the
contact information, see topic page).
• Rejection — By submitting the application, all applicants accept the general call conditions set out in the
General Annexes and the specific call conditions set out in the topics. Applications that do not comply with
all the call conditions will be rejected. This applies also to applicants: all applicants need to fulfil the
criteria; if any one of them does not, they must be replaced or the entire application will be rejected.
• Cancellation — There may be circumstances which may require the cancellation of the call. In this case,
applicants will be informed via a call update. Cancellations are without entitlement to compensation.
• Transparency — In accordance with Article 38 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046, information
about EU grants awarded is published each year on the Europa website.
This includes:
• beneficiaries’ names;
• beneficiaries’ addresses;
• the purpose for which the grant was awarded;
• the maximum amount awarded.
Publication can exceptionally be waived (following a reasoned and duly substantiated request), if there is a
risk that disclosure could jeopardise applicants’ rights and freedoms under the EU Charter of Fundamental
Rights or harm its commercial interests.
• Data protection — The submission of an application under this call involves the collection, use and
processing of personal data. This data will be processed in accordance with Regulation 2018/1725. It will
be processed solely for the purpose of evaluating the application (and subsequent management of the grant
and, if needed, programme monitoring, evaluation and communication). Details are explained in the
Funding & Tenders Portal privacy statement.

General Annexes
SPECIFIC CONDITIONS FOR ACTIONS WITH PCP/PPI
H — Specific conditions for actions implementing pre-commercial procurement or
procurement of innovative solutions
This Annex applies to all types of actions implementing pre-commercial procurement (PCP)
and procurement of innovative solutions (PPI). It applies to both PCP/PPI actions and other
types of actions which prepare and/or execute a PCP or PPI, for instance through
subcontracting activities.
Requirements for all types of actions supporting PCP or PPI
The PCP/PPI must be prepared and executed by one of the following:
- by one or more public procurer(s), plus possibly one or more private and/or NGO
procurer(s) that provide similar services of public interest, that is (are) responsible for
the acquisition and/or regulatory strategy of the relevant innovative solutions and aim
to obtain ambitious quality and efficiency improvements in the area of the PCP/PPI; or
- by entities with a mandate from one or more of these procurers to act on their behalf in
the procurement (e.g. central purchasing bodies).
Other entities (e.g. end-users) that do not have a conflict of interest with the PCP/PPI, and
whose participation in the action is well justified, may participate in ‘additional activities’ to
prepare, manage and follow-up the PCP/PPI and embed it into a wider set of demand-side
activities. This includes disseminating results, removing obstacles to introducing the solutions
onto the market (e.g. contributing to standardisation, regulation and certification), awareness
raising, experience sharing/training, and preparing further cooperation among stakeholders
and procurers for future PCP or PPI.
For PCP executed by a group of procurers, the buyers’ group must jointly prepare and
implement the pre-commercial procurement so that there is one joint call for tender, one joint
evaluation of offers, and a lead procurer40 awarding the research and development (R&D)
service contracts in the name and on behalf of the buyers’ group. The PCP must address one
concrete procurement need identified as a common challenge41, which requires new R&D and
is described in the common specifications of the joint PCP call for tender. Each procurer in
the buyers’ group must contribute financially to the total budget necessary to jointly finance
the PCP, enabling the procurers to share the costs of procuring R&D services from a number
of providers and comparing the merits of the alternative solutions pursued by these competing
providers to address the common challenge.
40 The ‘lead procurer’ is a public procurer and is the beneficiary appointed by the buyers’ group to coordinate
and lead the procurement activities. They can be either one of the procurers in the buyers’ group or another
beneficiary in the action who is established or designated by the procurers in the buyers’ group to act as lead
procurer.
41 Addressing the common challenge in different countries may require, beyond the common core functionality,
the development and testing of additional local functionality or adaption of solutions by each procurer due to
differences in the local context. A PCP that addresses a challenge consisting of several facets (sub-challenges or
building blocks) is considered one joint PCP, as long as all procurers in the buyers’ group share the need for -
and are willing to co-finance - all the facets of the common challenge.
Page 38 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
For PPI executed by a group of procurers, the lead procurer must coordinate the preparation
and implementation of one joint or several coordinated public procurements of innovative
solutions, based on common specifications defined jointly by the buyers’ group. Each PPI
must focus on one concrete need identified as a common challenge that requires the
deployment of innovative solutions42.
Projects that aim to implement a PCP/PPI must contain a preparation and execution stage.
Preparation stage
The expected outcomes for the preparation stage, to be included as deliverables/milestones,
are:
- a prior information notice for the open market consultation: 5 days before submission
for publication to the OJEU, i.e. a minimum of 50 days before the start of the first
meeting;
- a report on the result of the open market consultation, prior market analysis and its
impact on the tender documents; in addition, for PPI, feedback from activities to verify
market readiness before deployment (e.g. conformance testing, certification, quality
labelling);
- completed tender documents based on the Horizon Europe PCP/PPI model contract
documents, including the contract notice: 30 days before its submission to the OJEU;
- for PCP/PPI executed by a group of procurers: the signed joint procurement agreement
confirming the final means of cooperation, including the financial commitment of the
buyers’ group for the PCP/PPI, and final confirmation of the lead procurer.
Execution stage
The expected outcome of the execution stage is the implementation of the procurement
procedure and of the PCP/PPI contracts. For PCP, this includes validating and comparing the
performance of the competing PCP solutions to verify if they can be converted into permanent
service. For PPI, this includes deploying the innovative solutions and evaluating the results in
real-life operating conditions, with a duration that allows for appropriate evaluation of the
potential impact of these solutions if converted into permanent service.
Deliverables/milestones to be included in the description of work for the execution stage are:
– a copy of the contract award notice published in TED: 48 days after the award of
contracts;
– at the end of the tender evaluation (for PCP, also after the evaluations of each phase):
– information on the total number of bids received, particularly the data on the
winning tenderer(s) and abstracts of the winning tenders for publication and
evaluation purposes;
42 Addressing the common challenge in different countries may require deployment and, where applicable,
conformance testing, of local functionality or adaption of solutions for each procurer due to differences in the
local context.
Page 39 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
– final ranking list of the selected projects, final scores and qualitative assessment
per criterion for each bid received, along with minutes of the evaluation meeting;
– for PCP: assessing the results achieved by each tenderer in the previous phase;
– at the end of the action, give a demonstration to the granting authority:
– for PCP: of the tested solutions resulting from the PCP;
– for PPI: of the deployed innovative solution(s).
Where the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) does not apply, participation in
tendering procedures must be open on equal terms to bidders from EU Member States and all
countries with which the EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement under the
conditions laid down in that agreement, including all Horizon Europe Associated Countries.
Where the WTO GPA applies, tendering procedures must also be open to bidders from states
that have ratified this agreement, under the conditions laid down therein.
If the specific call conditions restrict participation or control for security reasons, participation
in the PCP/PPI procedure must also be limited to bidders meeting this restriction. If the
specific conditions for the topic impose a place of performance obligation, the place of
performance of the contract must comply with this obligation.
Specific requirements for pre-commercial procurement (PCP)
The following requirements apply to ensure that the provisions for PCP in the Horizon Europe
rules for participation, the conditions for the R&D services exemption of the EU Directives on
public procurement43, the EU Treaty principles44 and the competition rules45 are fully
respected.
Definitions
PCP must comply with the Horizon Europe definition: ‘Pre-commercial procurement’ means
procurement of R&D services involving risk-benefit sharing under market conditions and
competitive development in phases, where there is a clear separation between the procurement
of the R&D services procured from the deployment of commercial volumes of end-products46.
‘Risk-benefit sharing under market conditions’ refers to the PCP approach in which procurers
share with suppliers at market price the risks and benefits related to the intellectual property
rights (IPR) resulting from the R&D.
43 See Article 14 of Directive 2014/24/EU, Article 32 of Directive 2014/25/EU and Article 13(f)(j) of Directive
2009/81/EC.
44 In particular, the fundamental Treaty principles on the free movement of goods and workers, the freedom to
provide services, the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital, as well as the principles
deriving therefrom, such as the principles of non-discrimination, transparency and equal treatment.
45 See, in particular, Article 2.3 of the 2014 R&D&I State aid framework.
46 See the Horizon Europe Regulation and the PCP Communication COM/2007/799 and associated
SEC(1668)2007. Note that PCPs can include the purchase of the first end-products that were developed, installed
and tested during the PCP, but not the purchase of larger commercial volumes of end-products requiring quantity
production beyond delivering the first products for the PCP.
Page 40 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
‘Competitive development in phases’ refers to buying the R&D from several competing R&D
providers in parallel and to comparing and identifying the best-value-for-money solutions on
the market to address the PCP challenge. To reduce the investment risk for the procurer,
reward the most competitive solutions and facilitate the participation of smaller innovative
companies, the R&D is also split into phases (solution design, prototyping, original
development and validation/testing of the first products), with the number of competing R&D
providers being reduced after each phase.
‘Separation from the deployment of commercial volumes of end-products’ refers to the
complementarity of PCP, which focuses on the R&D phase before wide commercialisation,
and PPI, which does not focus on R&D but on wide commercialisation/diffusion of solutions.
Procurers can, but are not obliged, to procure R&D results from a PCP.
Preparation and publication of the open market consultation and call for tender
To prepare the call for tender, an open market consultation47 with potential tenderers and end-
users must be held to broach the views of the market on the intended scope of the R&D. The
results of this open market consultation must be taken into account to fine-tune the tender
specifications, so that the gap between state-of-the-art industry development and the
procurement needs justifies the procuring of R&D48 services.
The PCP contract notice must be published EU-wide49 in at least English. Offers must be
accepted and communication with stakeholders must be enabled at all stages in at least
English. All offers must be evaluated according to the same objective criteria, regardless of
the geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of the tenderers.
The prior information notice for the open market consultation and the contract notice must be
advertised widely, using in particular Horizon Europe internet sites and national contact
points. The Commission must be informed at least 5 days before the expected date of
publication of the prior information notice for the open market consultation and 30 days
before the expected date of publication of the PCP contract notice. The PCP call for tenders
must remain open for at least 60 days.
Tender documentation, procurement and implementation of the contract
47 The open market consultation should be organised in a way not to preclude or distort competition. In respect
of the Treaty principles, the open market consultation must be announced well in advance and widely - via a
prior information notice that is published at least 45 days before the first open market consultation meeting in the
Official Journal of the EU - and enable potential tenderers regardless of their geographic location to participate at
least in English. All information given in answers to questions from participants in the dialogue should be
documented and published.
48 In line with WTO GPA 2014 Article XIII(1)(f), R&D can cover activities such as solution exploration and
design, prototyping, up to the original development of a limited volume of first products or services in the form
of a test series. Original development of a first product or service may include limited production or supply to
incorporate the results of field testing and demonstrate that the product or service is suitable for production or
supply in quantity to acceptable quality standards. R&D does not include quantity production or supply to
establish commercial viability or to recover R&D costs, nor commercial development activities such as
incremental adaptations or routine or periodic changes to existing products, services, production lines, processes
or other operations in progress, even if such changes may represent improvements.
49 Through the Official Journal of the EU, using the TED (Tenders Electronic Daily) web portal.
Page 41 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
The PCP contract that will be concluded with each selected tenderer must take the form of
one single framework agreement covering all PCP phases, without contract renegotiations
after the award. This framework agreement must contain information on the procedures for
implementing the different phases (through specific contracts), including the format of the
intermediate evaluations (including evaluation criteria and weightings) for each phase.
For PCP executed by a group of procurers, the R&D service contracts are awarded by the lead
procurer and all selected tenderers can be paid by the lead procurer, or pro rata by each
procurer in the buyers’ group according to their share in the total PCP budget.
The PCP contract notice must contain information on the intended number of R&D providers
that will be selected (minimum of three providers) to start the PCP, the number of PCP phases
and the expected duration and budget for each PCP phase. The PCP must cover the full PCP
life cycle of solution design, prototyping, and original development, including installation and
testing of a limited volume of test series products/services in the procurer’s/end-user’s
premises. Each of the three PCP phases can be split up into further phases if appropriate.
The following simplified and/or accelerated PCP procedures may be used: for PCP that
require fast deployment50, one specific contract may cover both the second and third PCP
phase; if fewer than two tenderers are capable of performing the R&D services in the EU
Member States or Associated Countries (for security contracts, this may be restricted to the
Member States), the phase 1 contracts may be awarded to a minimum of two tenderers.
Procurers must avoid the use of selection criteria based on disproportionate qualification and
financial guarantee requirements (e.g. with regard to prior customer references and minimum
turnover). Functional/performance-based specifications must be used to formulate the object
of the PCP call for tender as a problem to be solved, without prescribing a specific approach
to be followed. Evaluation of the tenders must be based on best-value-for-money criteria, not
just lowest price.
The PCP process must be organised to avoid any conflicts of interest, including in the use of
external experts. Providers cannot be beneficiaries in an action during which the PCP is
planned or undertaken.
The PCP process must require selected providers to locate the majority of the R&D activities,
including the principal researcher(s) working for the PCP contract in particular, in the
Member States or Associated Countries51.
The PCP procurers must not reserve the R&D results exclusively for their own use. The
providers generating results must own the attached IPR, and the procurers must enjoy at least
royalty-free access rights to use the R&D results for their own use. The procurers must also
enjoy the right to grant (or to require the granting of) non-exclusive licences to third parties,
to exploit the results under fair and reasonable market conditions, without any right to
50 Especially where a budgetary commitment for deployment is already available at the start of the PCP (fast-
track PCP).
51 For duly justified reasons of public security, this may be limited to the EU Member States.
Page 42 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
sublicense. A call-back provision must ensure that, in case the providers fail to commercially
exploit the results within a given period after the PCP, or use the results to the detriment of
the public interest, including security interests, the procurers can require transfer of the
ownership of the results.
The procurers must inform tenderers of the right to publish public summaries of the results of
the PCP project, including information about key R&D results attained and lessons learnt (e.g.
on the feasibility of the solution approaches to meet the requirements and lessons learnt for
potential future deployment of solutions). Details that would be contrary to the public interest,
would harm legitimate business interests (e.g. regarding IPR-protected specificities of their
individual approaches to solutions) or could distort fair competition may not be disclosed.
To enable the procurers to establish the correct (best value for money) market price for the
R&D service, in which case the presence of State aid can in principle be excluded, the PCP
call for tender must be carried out in a competitive and transparent way in line with Treaty
principles. In addition, the distribution of rights and obligations between procurers and
providers (including the allocation of IPR) must be published in the PCP call for tender
documents, to obtain a price according to market conditions (and rule out State aid). PCP
contracts with providers must contain financial compensation according to market
conditions52, compared to the exclusive development price, for assigning IPR to the providers.
Specific requirements for public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI)
Definition
PPI must comply with the relevant Horizon Europe definitions.
‘Public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI)’ means procurement where contracting
authorities act as a launch customer for innovative goods or services which are not yet
available on a large-scale commercial basis, and may include conformity testing.
‘Launch customers’, also called early adopters, refer to the first 20% of customers on the
EU’s internal market that buy innovative solutions. The solutions have to be new to the
procurers in the project, the procurers’ market segment or new to the EU’s internal market,
and relevant to procurers in other Member States and/or Associated Countries.
‘Innovative solutions’ are new or significantly improved products, services or processes that
have already been (partially) demonstrated on a small scale, and may be nearly or already
available in small quantities on the market, but which have not been widely adopted yet.
Typically, owing to the residual risk of market uncertainty, they have not been produced at a
large enough scale to meet mass market price/quality requirements. This also includes
existing solutions that are to be utilised in a new and innovative way; PPI does not include the
procurement of R&D.
52 The market price should reflect the benefits allocated to the R&D provider (e.g. commercialisation
opportunities opened up by the IPR) and the risks assumed by the R&D provider (e.g. the cost of maintaining the
IPR and commercialising the products).
Page 43 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Preparation and publication of the open market consultation and call for tender
Unless the PPI is undertaken as a follow-up to an FP7, Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe
PCP53, or unless the situation is a low-value PPI below national procurement thresholds, the
following obligations apply:
– To prepare the call for tenders, an open market consultation with potential tenderers
and end-users must be held to inform the market well in advance of the upcoming PPI
and broach the views of the market on the PPI’s intended scope. Information retrieved
from this consultation about the gap between perceived procurement needs and on-
going industry developments must be taken into account in the PPI tender
specifications, so that the PPI duly focuses on ‘early adoption’ of ‘innovative’
solutions.
– The market must be informed well in advance54 of the target date for publishing the
PPI call for tenders. Market readiness prior to deployment can be verified through the
organisation of e.g. conformity testing, certification or quality labelling of solutions.
– The PPI contract notices must be published EU-wide in at least English, offers must be
accepted and communication with stakeholders must be enabled at all stages in at least
English. All offers must be evaluated according to the same objective criteria,
regardless of the geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of
the tenderers.
– The prior information notices for the open market consultation, early announcements
of the expected publication date of the PPI call for tender, and the PPI contract notice
must be promoted and advertised widely, using Horizon Europe internet sites and
national contact points in particular. The Commission must be informed at least 5 days
before the expected date of publication of the PIN for the open market consultation
and 30 days before the expected date of publication of the PPI contract notice. The PPI
call for tenders must remain open for at least 60 days.
Tender documentation, procurement and implementation of the contract
Procurement procedures covered by the EU public procurement directives that do not involve
procurement of R&D can be used. Restricted procedures with shortened timeframes for the
submission of offers for reasons of urgency must not be used. Framework
contracts/agreements with lots can be used.
For PPI implemented by a group of procurers, the specific contracts for procuring specific
quantities of goods/services for each procurer can be awarded and the selected tenderers can
53 In the case of a PPI following a PCP that was implemented according to the conditions described in Annex I,
the negotiated procedure without publication foreseen in the EU public procurement directives can then be used
(Article 32(3)(a) of Directive 2014/24/EU, Article 50(b) of Directive 2014/25/EU and Article 13(j) of Directive
2009/81/EC). At least three offers must be requested, including from the R&D providers that successfully
completed the preceding PCP.
54 By means of a prior information notice in the Official Journal of the EU.

General Annexes
either all be paid by the lead procurer, or by each procurer in the buyers’ group individually,
for their quantity of goods/services procured.
Procurers must avoid the use of selection criteria based on disproportionate qualification and
financial guarantee requirements (e.g. with regard to prior customer references and minimum
turnover). Functional/performance-based specifications must be used to formulate the object
of the PPI call for tenders as a problem to be solved, without prescribing a specific approach
to be followed. Evaluation of the tenders must be based on best-value-for-money criteria, not
just lowest price.
Procurers must organise their procurement to avoid any conflicts of interest, including in the
use of external experts. Potential providers cannot be beneficiaries in an action during which
the PPI is planned or undertaken.
To encourage fair and wide exploitation of results, ownership of IPR rights should be
assigned to the party generating the IPR, except in duly justified cases (e.g. when that party is
not able to exploit them).
The PPI call for tender must be carried out in a competitive and transparent way in line with
Treaty principles. The distribution of rights and obligations between procurers and providers
(including the allocation of IPR) must be published in the PPI call for tender documents, to
obtain a price according to market conditions (and rule out State aid).

The European Union needs a strong, resilient, flexible and creative human resource base, with
the right combination of skills to match the future needs of the labour market, to innovate and
to convert knowledge and ideas into products and services for economic and social benefit.
The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted once more the importance of the Union’s reliance on a
highly skilled research-based human capital that is able to detect and tackle upcoming
challenges, to communicate scientific evidence to policy-makers and the public at large, and
to work across disciplines.
In this context, the Union must reinforce its efforts to encourage more young women and men
to make a career in research, promote its attractiveness for top talents from around the world,
retain its own researchers and reintegrate those working elsewhere. The Marie Skłodowska-
Curie Actions (MSCA) are the main instrument at Union-level to do so. Since their launch in
1996, they have become the Union’s reference programme for doctoral education and
postdoctoral training. Between 2014 and 2020, in the context of Horizon 2020, the MSCA
have supported 65 000 researchers in Europe and beyond, both doctoral candidates and more
experienced researchers, and have funded over 1 000 excellent international doctoral
networks.
The MSCA strongly contribute to excellent research, boosting jobs, growth and investment by
equipping researchers with new knowledge and skills, including transferable ones1 and
providing them with an international as well as inter-sectoral exposure (including through
academia-business collaboration), to fill the top positions of tomorrow.
The MSCA do not only have a positive impact on individual researchers, they also contribute
to the development of excellent doctoral programmes, postdoctoral training programmes
and collaborative research projects. They have a structuring impact on higher education
institutions and other entities way beyond academia by widely spreading excellence and
setting standards for high-quality researcher education and training, not only across the
European Research Area (ERA), but also worldwide. Positive structuring effects on
organisations include:
• increasing the quality of researchers’ training and supervision offered;
• strengthening research capacity (e.g. ability to attract funding);
• improving human resources practices and procedures, and providing fairer and more
attractive working conditions for researchers, including through career guidance and
development;
1 As an illustration, Eurodoc published a list of such transferable skills at: http://eurodoc.net/skills-report-
2018.pdf; see also the European Competence Framework for Researchers, ResearchComp at:
ec_rtd_research-competence-presentation.pdf (europa.eu)
Page 6 of 142• building new and sustainable international and inter-sectoral partnerships and networks;
better transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines, enhancing their global
reputation and visibility.
Main principles applying to the MSCA
Excellence
The MSCA focus on excellence in various aspects: excellence does not only apply to the
individual fellows supported or the collaborations fostered and knowledge transferred, but
also to the R&I methodologies applied, the research conducted as well as the training,
supervision and career guidance provided. Long-term investment in people pays off, as
indicated inter alia by the number of Nobel Prize winners who have been either former
MSCA fellows or supervisors.
Mobility
The MSCA are based on the principle of physical mobility: researchers who receive funding
have to move from one country to another to acquire new knowledge, skills and competences,
and develop their research career. Researchers are also strongly encouraged to move between
sectors and disciplines.
While virtual mobility does not have the same multifaceted impact on the development of
individuals and sustainable cooperation among organisations as physical mobility, it can
however complement it, facilitate long-distance collaboration and be an effective means to
faster achieving research and training objectives. In this regard, all MSCA proposals are
encouraged to explore opportunities offered by e-infrastructures and related services, in
particular those provided through GEANT2, the pan-European research and education
network.
Bottom-up and open to the world
The MSCA are open to all domains of research and innovation, chosen freely by the
applicants in a fully bottom-up manner, addressed under the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union. In addition, Postdoctoral Fellowships can also address domains covered by
the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom Research and
Training Programme 2021-2025). All MSCA will complement top-down collaborative
research activities, notably contributing to the EU Missions.
The MSCA have also a strong international dimension: international cooperation is
particularly encouraged as it allows institutions to set-up strategic collaborations worldwide,
attracts foreign talents to Europe and provides European researchers with access to unique
expertise, facilities, testing environments or data available only outside Europe.
Recruitment, working/employment conditions and inclusiveness
2 http://www.geant.org
Page 7 of 142The principles of the European Charter for Researchers (Charter) promoting open, merit-
based and transparent recruitment and attractive working and employment conditions are a
cornerstone of the MSCA and all funded host organisations must put effort into applying
them. The MSCA pay particular attention to equal opportunities and inclusiveness. In line
with the Charter, all MSCA-funded projects are encouraged to embrace diversity and take
measures to facilitate mobility and counter-act gender and disability-related barriers to it.
MSCA projects are also encouraged to facilitate access by researchers at risk3, through
tailored support and career services, including job search assistance in the researcher’s new
geographical area.
Supervision
The MSCA promote effective supervision, which contribute to creating a supportive
environment for the researchers to conduct their work. In line with the principles set out in the
Charter, MSCA beneficiaries must ensure adequately supervision or mentoring and
appropriate career guidance. Supervision is one of the crucial elements of successful
research. Guiding, supporting, directing, advising and mentoring are key factors for a
researcher to pursue his/her career path. In this context, all MSCA-funded projects are
encouraged to follow the recommendations outlined in the Guidelines for MSCA
supervision4.
Open Science and Responsible Research and Innovation
The MSCA endorse Open Science and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
through engaging society at large, integrating the gender and ethical dimensions, promoting
Open Science practices through targeted training activities, ensuring open access to research
outcomes, including FAIR5 data handling, encouraging formal and informal science education
and feeding back research results into teaching and education.
The European Commission has also signed the Agreement on Reforming Research
Assessment6, which establishes a common direction for research assessment reforms, while
respecting organisations’ autonomy.
European Green Deal
The MSCA support bottom-up and frontier/applied research contributing directly to the
European Commission’s commitment to tackling climate and environmental-related
challenges. Under Horizon Europe, the MSCA will significantly contribute to promote
sustainable research in line with the European Green Deal, the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda
and the Sustainable Development Goals. All MSCA-funded projects are encouraged to

threats to their life, liberty, or research career, and those who are forced or have been forced to flee
because of such threats.

the environmental footprint of their activities.
Synergies
The MSCA promote the creation of strong links with the cohesion policy funds8 and the
Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF)9, notably by creating synergies through its COFUND
action and enabling complementarities via awarding a Seal of Excellence10 certificate to
proposals submitted to mono-beneficiary MSCA calls. The Seal is awarded to proposals that
exceed all the evaluation thresholds set out in this work programme but cannot be funded due
to lack of budget. The MSCA also encourage complementarities with other parts of Horizon
Europe, such as the European Innovation Council11 and European Institute of Innovation and
Technology (EIT)12, and synergies with other Union programmes, notably Erasmus+13,
including its European Universities Initiative.
MSCA Intervention areas
There are five main MSCA intervention areas as set out in the Council Decision establishing
the specific programme implementing Horizon Europe (Annex 1, page 11-13). All individual
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions contribute to these intervention areas to one extent or the
other:
1. Nurturing Excellence through Mobility of Researchers across Borders, Sectors and
Disciplines;
2. Fostering new Skills through Excellent Training of Researchers;
3. Strengthening Human Capital and Skills Development across the European Research
Area;
4. Improving and Facilitating Synergies;

HORIZON-MSCA-2023-DN-01-01: MSCA Doctoral Networks 2023
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For supported doctoral candidates
• New research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved
employability and career prospects within and outside academia;
• New knowledge allowing the conversion of ideas into products and services, where
relevant;
• Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as
with the general public that will increase and broaden the research and innovation
impact.
For participating organisations
• Improved quality, relevance and sustainability of doctoral training programmes and
supervision arrangements;
• Enhanced cooperation and transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines;
• Increased integration of training and research activities between participating
organisations;
Page 15 of 142• Boosted R&I capacity;
• Increased internationalisation and attractiveness;
• Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating
organisations.
Scope: MSCA Doctoral Networks will implement doctoral programmes, by partnerships of
universities, research institutions and research infrastructures, businesses including SMEs,
and other socio-economic actors from different countries across Europe and beyond. MSCA
Doctoral Networks are indeed open to the participation of organisations from third countries,
in view of fostering strategic international partnerships for the training and exchange of
researchers.
These doctoral programmes will respond to well-identified needs in various R&I areas,
expose the researchers to the academic and non-academic sectors, and offer training in
research-related, as well as transferable skills16 and competences relevant for innovation and
long-term employability (e.g. entrepreneurship, commercialisation of results, Intellectual
Property Rights, communication). Proposals for doctoral networks can reflect existing or
planned research partnerships among the participating organisations.
The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in
line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be
widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS17 website) must mention if
the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible,
the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions) should be published.
MSCA Doctoral Networks are encouraged to lead to Industrial or Joint Doctorates.
Industrial Doctorates
Through Industrial Doctorates, doctoral candidates will step outside academia and develop
skills in industry and business by being jointly supervised by academic and non-academic
organisations, both of which can be established in the same EU Member State or Horizon
Europe Associated Country.
Joint Doctorates
Joint Doctorates represent a highly integrated type of international, inter-sectoral and
multi/interdisciplinary collaboration in doctoral training. They lead to the delivery of joint,
double or multiple doctoral degrees18 recognised in at least two EU Member States or Horizon
Europe Associated Countries.
16 As an illustration, Eurodoc published a list of such transferable skills at: http://eurodoc.net/skills-report-
2018.pdf
17 https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/
18 Every time this Work Programme part refers to doctoral degrees, this means that the degrees have to be
recognised as such by the relevant authorities of the country or countries concerned.
Page 16 of 142Supervisory Board
Each MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-
ordinating network-wide training, research and in particular supervision activities in line with
the Guidelines for MSCA supervision, while establishing continuous communication and
exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of
the partnership.
Training activities
MSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating
organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through
the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to
well identified needs in various R&I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and
multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training19. They
should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original
research on personalised projects.
Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in
third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and
in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers
outside academia.
Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, including digital ones,
addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the
culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct
such as research integrity. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare
doctoral candidates for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made
possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications
and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement
and citizen science, etc.).
Supervision
Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well
as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint
Doctorates.
Career Development Plan
A Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited
doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving
all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training
and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications
and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to
19 principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf

Proposals are invited against the following topic(s):
HORIZON-MSCA-2024-DN-01-01: MSCA Doctoral Networks 2024
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For supported doctoral candidates
• New research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved
employability and career prospects within and outside academia;
• New knowledge allowing the conversion of ideas into products and services, where
relevant;
• Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as
with the general public that will increase and broaden the research and innovation
impact.
For participating organisations
• Improved quality, relevance and sustainability of doctoral training programmes and
supervision arrangements;
• Enhanced cooperation and transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines;
Page 19 of 142• Increased integration of training and research activities between participating
organisations;
• Boosted R&I capacity;
• Increased internationalisation and attractiveness;
• Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating
organisations.
Scope: MSCA Doctoral Networks will implement doctoral programmes, by partnerships of
universities, research institutions and research infrastructures, businesses including SMEs,
and other socio-economic actors from different countries across Europe and beyond. MSCA
Doctoral Networks are indeed open to the participation of organisations from third countries,
in view of fostering strategic international partnerships for the training and exchange of
researchers.
These doctoral programmes will respond to well-identified needs in various R&I areas,
expose the researchers to the academic and non-academic sectors, and offer training in
research-related, as well as transferable skills and competences relevant for innovation and
long-term employability (e.g. entrepreneurship, commercialisation of results, Intellectual
Property Rights, communication). Proposals for doctoral networks can reflect existing or
planned research partnerships among the participating organisations.
The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in
line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be
widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS21 website) must mention if
the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible,
the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions) should be published.
MSCA Doctoral Networks are encouraged to lead to Industrial or Joint Doctorates.
Industrial Doctorates
Through Industrial Doctorates, doctoral candidates will step outside academia and develop
skills in industry and business by being jointly supervised by academic and non-academic
organisations, both of which can be established in the same EU Member State or Horizon
Europe Associated Country.
Joint Doctorates
Joint Doctorates represent a highly integrated type of international, inter-sectoral and
multi/interdisciplinary collaboration in doctoral training. They lead to the delivery of joint,
21 https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/
Page 20 of 142double or multiple doctoral degrees22 recognised in at least one EU Member State or Horizon
Europe Associated Country.
Supervisory Board
Each MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-
ordinating network-wide training, research and in particular supervision activities in line with
the Guidelines for MSCA supervision, while establishing continuous communication and
exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of
the partnership.
Training activities
MSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating
organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through
the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to
well identified needs in various R&I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and
multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training23. They
should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original
research on personalised projects.
Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in
third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and
in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers
outside academia.
Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, including digital ones,
addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the
culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct
such as research integrity. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare
doctoral candidates for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made
possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications
and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement
and citizen science, etc.).
Supervision
Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well
as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint
Doctorates.
Career Development Plan
22 Every time this Work Programme part refers to doctoral degrees, this means that the degrees have to be
recognised as such by the relevant authorities of the country or countries concerned.
23 principles_for_innovative_doctoral_training.pdf
Page 21 of 142A Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited
doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving
all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training
and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications
and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to
citizens. The plan, established at the beginning of the recruitment, should be revised (and
updated where needed) within 18 months.

The goal of MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships is to enhance the creative and innovative
potential of researchers holding a PhD and who wish to acquire new skills through advanced
training, international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary mobility. MSCA Postdoctoral
Fellowships will be open to excellent researchers of any nationality. The scheme also
encourages researchers to work on research and innovation projects in the non-academic
sector and is open to researchers wishing to reintegrate in Europe, to those who are displaced
by conflict, as well as to researchers with high potential who are seeking to restart their
careers in research.
Through the implementation of an original and personalised research project, MSCA
Postdoctoral Fellowships aim to foster excellence through training and mobility and to equip
researchers with new skills and competences in order to identify solutions to current and
future challenges. Postdoctoral researchers are encouraged to engage with society at large to
make the results of their research visible to citizens and to involve citizens, civil society and
end-users in co-creation of research content when relevant.
Expected impact
Proposals under this Action should contribute to the following expected impacts:
• Enhance the creative and innovative potential of researchers holding a PhD and wishing
to diversify their individual competences and skills through advanced training,
international, interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral mobility while implementing excellent
research projects across all sectors of research;
• Strengthen Europe's human capital base in R&I with better trained, innovative and
entrepreneurial researchers;
• Enhance the quality of R&I contributing to Europe's competitiveness and growth;
• Contribute to Europe's attractiveness as a leading destination for R&I and for good
working conditions of researchers;

Scope: Fellowships will be provided to excellent researchers undertaking international
mobility. Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the
academic or non-academic sector.
Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a
Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:
• European Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish
to engage in R&I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or
moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12
and 24 months.
• Global Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to European nationals or long-term residents29
who wish to engage in R&I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and
Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of
minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a
mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or
a Horizon Europe Associated Country.
Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas
covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-202530.
Secondments
Researchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase,
within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment
phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.
29 See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.
30 See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.
Page 31 of 142For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed one third of the
requested duration of the action (excluding from the duration of the action any additional
period for a non-academic placement) and should be in line with the project objectives,
adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.
For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to one third
of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months of such secondments can be spent at the
start of the project at the beneficiary (or associated partners linked to the beneficiary),
allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third
Country. This period of maximum three months will be considered as part of the outgoing
phase.
Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host
organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.
Placements in the non-academic sector
Postdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support
researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an
organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe Associated Country31. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in
the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic
host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated
Country32. The request for such a non-academic placement must be an integral part of the
proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the
researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves
between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer
while expanding career opportunities for researchers.
If the placement does not meet the requirements (taking place in an academic organisation or
in a Third Country), the proposal will be evaluated without taking into account the placement.
This might affect the final score.
Training activities
The training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should include
training for key transferable skills 33 , foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g.
commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement
and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote
Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs including
data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science etc.).
31 For proposals in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme, the
organisation from the non-academic sector must be established in an EU Member State or a country
associated to the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025
32 idem
33 As an illustration, Eurodoc published a list of such transferable skills at: http://eurodoc.net/skills-report-
2018.pdf
Page 32 of 142Career Development Plan
In order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career
opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established
jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan
should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable
skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming
at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project
deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.
Euratom
Aiming to enhance nuclear expertise and excellence as well as synergies between
Programmes, organisations active in nuclear research established in one of EU Member States
or countries associated to the Euratom Research and Training programme 2021-2025, are
eligible to participate34. MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in this area of research will be
supported by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025 through an
indicative annual financial contribution of EUR 1 million to the MSCA Postdoctoral
Fellowships call35.
ERA Fellowships
The ERA Fellowships implemented through Work Programme Annex 11, Widening
Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area, provide specific support to
researchers to undertake their fellowship in a widening country36. This will help spread

data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science etc.).
Career Development Plan
In order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career
opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established
jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan
should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable
skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming
at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project
deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For supported postdoctoral fellows
Page 39 of 142• Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved
employability and career prospects of MSCA postdoctoral fellows within academia and
beyond;
• New mind-sets and approaches to R&I work forged through international, inter-sectoral
and interdisciplinary experience;
• Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as
with the general public that will increase and broaden the research and innovation
impact.
For participating organisations
• Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the
principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers;
• Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;
• Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation of the participating
organisation(s);
• Stronger R&I capacity and output among participating organisations; better transfer of
knowledge;
• Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating
organisations.
Scope: Fellowships will be provided to excellent researchers undertaking international
mobility. Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the
academic or non-academic sector.
Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a
Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:
• European Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish
to engage in R&I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or
moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12
and 24 months.
• Global Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to European nationals or long-term residents46
who wish to engage in R&I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and
Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of
minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a
mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or
a Horizon Europe Associated Country.
46 See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.
Page 40 of 142Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas
covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-202547.
Secondments
Researchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase,
within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment
phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.
For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed one third of the
requested duration of the action (excluding from the duration of the action any additional
period for a non-academic placement) and should be in line with the project objectives,
adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.
For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to one third
of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months of such secondments can be spent at the
start of the project at the beneficiary (or associated partners linked to the beneficiary),
allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third
Country. This period of maximum three months will be considered as part of the outgoing
phase.
Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host
organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.
Placements in the non-academic sector
Postdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support
researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an
organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe Associated Country48. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in
the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic
host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated
Country49. The request for such a non-academic placement must be an integral part of the
proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the
researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves
between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer
while expanding career opportunities for researchers.
If the placement does not meet the requirements (taking place in an academic organisation or
in a Third Country), the proposal will be evaluated without taking into account the placement.
This might affect the final score.
Training activities
47 See eligibility conditions at the end of this Work Programme part.
48 For proposals in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme, the
organisation from the non-academic sector must be established in an EU Member State or a country
associated to the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025
49 idem
Page 41 of 142The training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should include
training for key transferable skills, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g.
commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement
and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote
Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs including
data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science etc.).
Career Development Plan
In order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career
opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established
jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan
should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable
skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming
at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project
deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.

HORIZON-MSCA-2023-SE-01-01: MSCA Staff Exchanges 2023
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For staff members
• Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved
employability and career prospects within and outside academia;
• More knowledge and innovative ideas converted into products, processes and services;
• More entrepreneurial mind-sets, testing new and innovative ideas;
• Increased international exposure leading to extended networks and opportunities;
• Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as
with the general public that will increase and broaden the research and innovation
impact.
For participating organisations
• Innovative ways of cooperation and transfer of knowledge between sectors and
disciplines;
• Strengthened and broader international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary collaborative
networks;
• Boosted R&I capacity.
Scope: MSCA Staff Exchanges involve organisations from the academic and non-academic
sectors (including SMEs) from across the globe.
Page 45 of 142Support is provided for international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary mobility of R&I staff
leading to knowledge transfer between participating organisations.
Mobility through secondments
The organisations constituting the partnership contribute directly to the implementation of a
joint R&I project by seconding and/or hosting eligible staff members. Such a project must
explore activities that can be based on previous work but should go beyond and generate or
strengthen long-term collaborations. Secondments must involve physical mobility54 of the
eligible staff members and must always take place between legal entities independent from
each other.
MSCA Staff Exchanges can address three dimensions of mobility: international, inter-sectoral
and interdisciplinary55. While exchanges between organisations within EU Member States and
Horizon Europe Associated Countries should mainly be inter-sectoral, same-sector
exchanges 56 are also possible under the condition that they are interdisciplinary.
Interdisciplinarity is not required for same-sector exchanges with non-associated Third
Countries.
Secondments between institutions established in non-associated Third Countries or within the
same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country are not eligible.
The collaborative approach of MSCA Staff Exchanges should exploit complementary
competences of the participating organisations and create synergies between them. The
secondments should be essential to achieve the joint project’s R&I activities. The project
should inter alia enable networking activities and the organisation of workshops and
conferences, to facilitate sharing of knowledge and testing of innovative approaches for
specific R&I topics.
Skills’ development
For participating staff members, the project should offer new skills acquisition and career
development perspectives. Participating organisations must ensure that the seconded staff are
adequately mentored.

organisations.
Scope: Applicants submit proposals for new or existing doctoral or postdoctoral programmes
with an impact on the enhancement of human resources in R&I at regional, national or
international level. These programmes will be co-funded by MSCA COFUND.
Proposed programmes can cover any research disciplines ("bottom-up"), but exceptionally
can also focus on specific disciplines, notably when they are based on national or regional
Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3 strategies). In this case, the
range of covered disciplines should allow reasonable flexibility for the researchers to define
their topic.
Funding synergies with Cohesion policy funds and the Recovery and Resilience Facility
(RRF) are strongly encouraged66,67.
A Career Development Plan must be jointly established by the supervisor and each recruited
researcher upon recruitment. In addition to research objectives, this Plan comprises the
researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching,
planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aimed at opening
science and research to citizens. The Plan must be established at the beginning of the
recruitment and should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.
COFUND takes the form of:
A) Doctoral programmes
Doctoral programmes offer research training activities to allow doctoral candidates to develop
and broaden their skills and competences. They will lead to the award of a doctoral degree in
at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The training activities
should be based on the EU Principles on Innovative Doctoral Training.
Substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills and
competences common to all fields, fostering good scientific conduct such as research
integrity, and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship will be
supported. They will include, inter alia, training on the use of collaborative tools and
approaches, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR
data management, societal engagement and citizen science.
On top of compulsory international mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of
cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes. Collaboration with a
wider set of associated partners, including from the non-academic sector, will be positively

secondment opportunities or training modules in research or transferable skills.
Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well
as career guidance. The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent
and merit-based, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The
vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS68
website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and
contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions)
should be published.
B) Postdoctoral Programmes
Postdoctoral Programmes fund individual advanced research training and career development
fellowships for postdoctoral researchers. The programmes should offer training to develop
key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, foster good scientific conduct
such as research integrity, foster innovation and entrepreneurship and promote and (where
appropriate) reward Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research
outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science,
etc.).
Postdoctoral Programmes should have regular selection rounds following fixed deadlines or
regular cut-off dates, allowing fair competition between researchers. The selection procedure
for postdoctoral candidates must be open, competitive, merit-based and with a transparent
international peer review, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of
Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the

Page 66 of 142MSCA and Citizens
MSCA and Citizens aims to bring research and researchers closer to the public at large, to
increase awareness of research and innovation activities and to boost public recognition of
science and research education. It will show the role of the researcher for the society and
economy, as well as the impact of researchers’ work on citizens’ daily lives. It also aims to
raise the interest of young people in research and scientific careers.
MSCA and Citizens will address the general public, attracting people regardless of the level
of their scientific background, with a specific focus on families, pupils, students, and notably
those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in, STEAM fields
(science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities. Inclusiveness
should be key, in view of broadening access to science and research to all.
MSCA and Citizens should also promote gender balance and inclusiveness in science, Open
Science, and Responsible Research and Innovation.
These objectives will be pursued through the organisation of the European Researchers’ Night
and the implementation of the Researchers at Schools initiative.
The European Researchers ‘Night is the largest research communication and promotion event
taking place across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries.
The Researchers at Schools initiative aims to strengthen the connection between research and
education, by bringing researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to
encourage interaction with pupils at all levels of primary and secondary education.
Researchers and pupils will meet to talk about current and future challenges of our societies
and the related key role of research. Pupils will learn directly about research projects and
activities addressing the EU priorities and main orientations.
Expected impact
Proposals under this Action should contribute to the following expected impacts:
• Enhance engagement with citizens on R&I;
• Increase awareness among the general public of the importance and benefits of R&I and
its concrete impact on citizens’ daily life;
• Contribute to the diffusion and the promotion of excellence research projects across
Europe and beyond;
• Raise the interest of young people in science and research careers;
• Contribute to a better understanding of the European Union policies and programmes
among the general public;
Page 67 of 142• Support school teachers and educators in developing a scientific approach around
priority topics and creating a learning opportunity for pupils through a direct interaction
with researchers.

selection of a proposal requesting different amounts.
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 15.42 million.
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For researchers
• Enhanced opportunities to interact with citizens and local, regional and national
authorities;
• Improved communication skills and competences to interact with a non-research
audience, notably with pupils and students.
For organisations
• Increased reputation and visibility of participating organisations in terms of hosting
excellence research projects towards the general public and possible future students;
• Researchers’ work made more tangible, concrete, accessible, and thus opening research
and science to all;
• Improved outreach to all audiences, and notably those who do not have an easy access to
science and research activities;
• Better communication of R&I results and activities to society, increased and
strengthened opportunities for citizens’ engagement.
Page 70 of 142Scope: Proposals should cover both the organisation of the European Researchers’ Night and
the implementation of the Researchers at Schools initiative.
The European Researchers' Night takes place every year, on the last Friday of September79. It
supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the
following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up
meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a
Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.
The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people
regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people
and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and
thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and
mathematics) or research activities.
The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and
educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of
research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and
initiatives related to EU main priorities.
Types of activities
European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially
when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on
experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where
appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage
formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge
base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-
wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on
citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration
of the event, its location and its activities.
Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact
with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related
to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European
Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU
Missions. The Researchers at Schools activities should take place at any time during the
project duration and should be subject to a dedicated promotion, particularly towards schools
and other pedagogical and educational centres.
Involvement of researchers funded by Horizon Europe or previous Framework Programmes,
notably by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, is highly encouraged.
79 Except for countries which for strong cultural reasons would be prevented from organising any action
addressing the public at large on such a date.
Page 71 of 142Both the European Researchers’ Night and Researchers at Schools initiative should promote
gender balance, diversity and inclusiveness in science in terms of planned activities and
researchers involved.
The European Commission has defined priorities, notably through the EU Missions, which
aim to tackle challenges faced by our societies. Applicants are encouraged to focus on, and
include activities relating to these priorities identified by the Missions in their events.
Partnerships and coordination at regional, national or cross-border levels will be strongly
encouraged aiming at a good geographical spread and avoiding overlaps. Activities carried-
out in non-associated third countries are not eligible for funding.
High-quality applications not retained due to lack of funding may be granted the status of
associated events.
Eligible costs will take the form of lump sum contributions as stipulated in Decision of 11
March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie
Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.
Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals covering activities for both 2024 and 2025,
including the organisation of two successive editions80 (2024 and 2025) of the European
Researchers’ Night and implementation of Researchers at Schools activities during the project
duration.

project appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts.
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 16.25 million.
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions
Page 73 of 142Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For researchers
• Enhanced opportunities to interact with citizens and local, regional and national
authorities;
• Improved communication skills and competences to interact with a non-research
audience, notably with pupils and students.
For organisations
• Increased reputation and visibility of participating organisations in terms of hosting
excellence research projects towards the general public and possible future students;
• Researchers’ work made more tangible, concrete, accessible, and thus opening research
and science to all;
• Improved outreach to all audiences, and notably those who do not have an easy access to
science and research activities;
• Better communication of R&I results and activities to society, increased and
strengthened opportunities for citizens’ engagement.
Scope: Proposals should cover both the organisation of the European Researchers’ Night and
the implementation of the Researchers at Schools initiative.
The European Researchers' Night takes place every year, on the last Friday of September83. It
supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the
following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up
meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a
Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.
The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people
regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people
and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and
thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and
mathematics) or research activities.
The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and
educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of
research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and
initiatives related to EU main priorities.
Types of activities
83 Except for countries which for strong cultural reasons would be prevented from organising any action
addressing the public at large on such a date.
Page 74 of 142European Researchers’ Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially
when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on
experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where
appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage
formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge
base. The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-
wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on
citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration
of the event, its location and its activities.
Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact
with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related
to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European
Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU
Missions. The Researchers at Schools activities should take place at any time during the
project duration and should be subject to a dedicated promotion, particularly towards schools
and other pedagogical and educational centres.
Involvement of researchers funded by Horizon Europe or previous Framework Programmes,
notably by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, is highly encouraged.
Both the European Researchers’ Night and Researchers at Schools initiative should promote
gender balance, diversity and inclusiveness in science in terms of planned activities and
researchers involved.
The European Commission has defined priorities, notably through the EU Missions, which
aim to tackle challenges faced by our societies. Applicants are encouraged to focus on, and
include activities relating to these priorities identified by the Missions in their events.
Partnerships and coordination at regional, national or cross-border levels will be strongly
encouraged aiming at a good geographical spread and avoiding overlaps. Activities carried-
out in non-associated third countries are not eligible for funding.
High-quality applications not retained due to lack of funding may be granted the status of
associated events.
Eligible costs will take the form of lump sum contributions as stipulated in Decision of 11
March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie
Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.
Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals covering activities for both 2026 and 2027,
including the organisation of two successive editions84 (2026 and 2027) of the European
Researchers’ Night and implementation of Researchers at Schools activities during the project
duration.
84 The expected contribution for projects covering two editions of the European Researchers’ Night and
Researchers at Schools activities is between EUR 0.1 and 0.3 million, but this does not preclude
submission and selection of proposals requesting different amounts.
Page 75 of 142MSCA Support
MSCA Support includes a set of activities organised through calls for proposals to promote,
support and complement the MSCA implementation. They will cover:
• the exploitation of the MSCA contribution to EU policies and priorities;
• the facilitation of cooperation between MSCA National Contact Points (NCPs);
• the promotion of the MSCA at international level;
• the support to European and national initiatives and programmes in support of
researchers at risk.
Expected impact
Proposals under MSCA Support should contribute to some of the following expected impacts:
• Ensure a coordinated and strategic monitoring, assessment and dissemination of the
MSCA results and best practices vis-à-vis relevant EU priorities (including EU
Missions) and ERA objectives;
• Improve and further professionalise MSCA NCP services allowing a wider diffusion of
the programme, lowering entry barriers for newcomers and increasing the overall quality
of submitted proposals;
• Contribute to a more strategic international cooperation in MSCA in line with R&I
mutual interests and EU external policies;
• Strengthen co-operation between European and national initiatives and programmes in
support of researchers who are experiencing threats to their life, liberty, or research
career, and those who are forced or have been forced to flee because of such threats.

Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following
exceptions apply:
The granting authority can fund a maximum of one project.
The evaluation committee will be composed partially or fully by
representatives of EU institutions.
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
• Coordinated monitoring and exploitation of the contribution of Horizon 2020 and
Horizon Europe MSCA projects87 to the EU Missions88;
• Enhanced interaction between MSCA beneficiaries, researchers and policymakers, on
research results and their contribution to policy developments, and greater collaboration
87 This refers to MSCA Innovative Training Networks, Individual Fellowships, Research and Innovation
Staff Exchanges, COFUND, NIGHT in Horizon 2020, and MSCA Doctoral Networks, Postdoctoral
Fellowships, Staff exchanges, COFUND, MSCA and Citizens in Horizon Europe.
88 EU Missions in Horizon Europe | European Commission (europa.eu)
Page 79 of 142among MSCA beneficiaries and researchers themselves particularly in view of possible
follow-up partnerships and funding opportunities89;
• Detailed MSCA portfolio analysis in the EU Missions areas;
• Recommendations for strengthening the policy impact of the MSCA;
• Assessment of the contribution of the MSCA to the ERA policy objectives related to
support for researchers’ training and skills development, and intersectoral cooperation;
• Strengthened synergies and complementarities between the MSCA and other relevant
EU-funded initiatives and programmes linked to the EU Missions, researchers’ training,
skills and career development and related intersectoral cooperation.
Scope: While the bottom-up nature of the MSCA is and will remain its core principle, there is
a need to have an overview of the funded research portfolio and make stronger thematic links
between MSCA projects, raise visibility of their impact on ERA priority areas and gather
stakeholder feedback on ways to maximise the MSCA impact. Given the thematic diversity of
MSCA-funded projects, the scope of this call cannot cover all the areas to which the MSCA
contribute. It should be seen as a pilot to map areas and types of intervention for possible
similar actions in the future that will support a broader policy feedback process.
One of the objectives of this action is to support ongoing and planned Commission
initiatives90 which focus on exploiting and assessing the impact of Horizon 2020 and Horizon
Europe projects results in relation to thematic and cross-cutting priorities, including the EU
Missions.
It also aims to assess the extent to which MSCA projects achieve two of the core horizontal
policy objectives of the programme: the development of researchers’ training, skills and
career and the related promotion of intersectoral collaboration.
Activities should therefore include the contribution and impact of MSCA projects in relation
to:
• The EU Missions and societal challenges they address;
• Researchers’ skills development, including but not limited to the skills needed to tackle
the thematic areas of the Missions;
• Cooperation between academic and non-academic organisations91, with the emphasis on
the business sector.
89 E.g. by following up outcomes and feedback received from MSCA cluster events through ensuring
interaction with and between stakeholders
90 E.g. Horizon Results Platform, Horizon Results Booster
91 See definitions at the end of this Work Programme part
Page 80 of 142The activities should contribute to strengthening complementarities between ongoing MSCA
projects, especially with a view to better exploiting their results and maximising their impact
vis-à-vis the thematic and cross-cutting priorities mentioned above.
The proposed activities should include:
• Consolidating the ongoing EU Missions cross-portfolio analysis to make full use of
MSCA projects results and analyse their contribution to each individual Mission;
• Identifying good practice examples of cooperation between academic and non-academic
organisations, with a special emphasis on the business sector as well as the main
obstacles for stronger intersectoral cooperation in MSCA;
• Identifying researchers’ training, skills and career development needs (both research-
related and transferable) to tackle societal challenges, including those covered by the
Missions;
• Exploring ways to consolidate the available training material developed in MSCA
projects, especially on transferrable skills, and exploring how to make it more broadly
accessible for further exploitation;
• Following up the existing policy feedback activities under the MSCA, particularly
through coordination with the ongoing Commission activities (cluster events, studies and
analyses) and through regular consolidation of the outcomes and deliverables of policy
feedback activities;
• Supporting/complementing existing communication and dissemination efforts by the
European Commission92 to promote and share MSCA success stories and examples of
good practice in the thematic and horizontal priorities of this call (EU Missions,
intersectoral cooperation, researchers’ training, skills and career development);
• Identifying good practice of synergies between MSCA projects and other relevant
programmes and initiatives;
• Providing practical recommendations on how to better exploit MSCA project results and
enhance impact in the areas of EU Missions, intersectoral cooperation and researchers’
skills and career development in line with the call’s objectives.
• Analysing trends in research to feed back into the MSCA and Commission R&I policy.
Due to their bottom-up nature, the MSCA provide a valuable resource for tracking
changing research trends and can provide and evidence base for any changes in the latter
stages of Horizon Europe as well as the design of subsequent framework programmes;
The expected deliverables should include a combination of analytical reports, ad hoc policy
briefs, stakeholders’ events and meetings, policy roundtables and different communication
and dissemination support actions, such as:
92 E.g.: Horizon Results Platform and Booster, Euraxess
Page 81 of 142- Studies, analyses, reports looking into trends and developments in MSCA relevant to:
• The EU Missions, including citizens’ engagement activities;
• Researchers’ skills and career development and training;
• Intersectoral cooperation between academia and other sectors (businesses, industry,
SMEs, public administration, civil society organisations, etc.), as well as motivation and
obstacles to engage in such cooperation;
• Examples of synergies and complementarities with other EU/national/regional
programmes and frameworks.
- Consolidation of projects results for policy feedback and communication and dissemination
purposes;
- Dissemination and networking activities using the results of cluster events and communities
of practice identified for the events; consulting project beneficiaries on policy needs,
dissemination based on reports and feedback from cluster events; providing input into
coordination of cluster events (e.g. suggesting themes, format and structure of cluster events);
- Synthesis of coordination activities linked to policy feedback and the improved exploitation
of MSCA projects results: e.g. preparatory briefings, follow-up reports, feedback
consolidation linked to MSCA cluster events, ad hoc policy briefs and monitoring of
exploitation opportunities.
The maximum duration of the action is 48 months.

Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions
Eligibility The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following
conditions exceptions apply:
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: Participants other than
associated partners must be Horizon Europe national support structures
(e.g. NCP) responsible for MSCA and officially nominated to the
Commission, from a Member State or Associated Country.
Only if and for as long as Horizon Europe structures have not been
officially nominated when the call opens, will national support structures
responsible for MSCA nominated for Horizon 2020 be eligible.
Due to the scope of this topic, legal entities established in non-associated
third countries are exceptionally eligible for Union funding.
Legal entities established in non-associated third countries may
exceptionally participate in this Coordination and support action in a
capacity other than as an associated partner.
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following
exceptions apply:
The evaluation committee will be composed partially or fully by
representatives of EU institutions.
The granting authority can fund a maximum of one project.
Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
• An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, thereby helping simplify
access to Horizon Europe calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising
the average quality of proposals submitted;
• Harmonised and improved trans-national cooperation between NCPs;
• More consistent level of NCP support services across Europe and beyond, notably in
widening countries;
• Increased participation of third-country NCPs in the activities of the action.
Scope: The objective is to facilitate the trans-national co-operation between National Contact
Points (NCPs) for the MSCA, including those established in Third Countries, with a view to
identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to
applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors and experiences.
Page 84 of 142Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated MSCA NCPs. The activities will
be tailor-made to the needs and priorities of the NCPs concerned and may include
benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, training sessions
linked to the MSCA and wider R&I priorities and tools, twinning and mentoring schemes.
Special attention will be given to enhancing the competence of MSCA NCPs, including
helping newcomers and less experienced NCPs to rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated
by their peers. Cooperation with other EU networks such as Euraxess Worldwide, Enterprise
Europe Network, COST, will be encouraged to increase the visibility to potential
beneficiaries, especially in the non-academic sector.
Addressing the R&I gap
There still is a research and innovation gap across Europe and discrepancies remain between
European countries in their capacity to attract funding and researchers. This gap is observed in
the MSCA as well, and specific measures to support the NCPs in “widening countries,” such
as training and mentorship schemes, should be organised to stimulate more high-quality
applications with beneficiaries in these countries and increase their success rate in MSCA.
Attract researchers from third countries
The MSCA are the main EU instrument to attract researchers from Third Countries to Europe.
Specific measures to encourage Third-Country NCPs to create contacts and participate in the
activities of the project (e.g. training, twinning, mentoring, and other capacity building and
networking activities) should be foreseen.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to the MSCA and should not duplicate
actions foreseen in the NCP network under “Widening participation and strengthening the
European Research Area”.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs
and include NCPs from widening countries.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs choosing not to participate as a member
of the consortium are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project
activities (e.g. workshops).
The expected duration of the action will be 36 months.

Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following
exceptions apply:
The granting authority can fund a maximum of one project.
The evaluation committee will be composed partially or fully by
representatives of EU institutions.
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
• Broader and more strategic promotion of international cooperation opportunities offered
through MSCA;
• Monitoring progress, opportunities and challenges in MSCA bilateral and bi-regional
cooperation with main international partner countries and regions;
• Strengthening complementarities with other relevant promotion and cooperation
initiatives funded through Horizon Europe or other EU programmes.
Scope: The objective is to foster international cooperation in MSCA in Horizon Europe,
through a dedicated support action to complement and ensure coordination between existing
promotion channels at local level, and ensure consistency with formal R&I policy dialogues at
bilateral and regional levels. Focus should be given:
• At bilateral level on countries having concluded bilateral Science and Technology
Agreements with the EU (Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,
Egypt, India, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, South Africa,
Switzerland, Tunisia, Ukraine and the United States).
• At regional level, on bi-regional research and innovation policy dialogues, established
notably with the African Union, ASEAN, LAC, Mediterranean partner countries, Eastern
Partnership countries and Western Balkans.
Page 87 of 142Based on the outcomes of a study97 on the MSCA international dimension in Horizon 2020,
activities to be implemented should include:
• Policy support to bilateral/bi-regional cooperation: assessing main cooperation trends,
opportunities and challenges related to local developments in the R&I/higher education
domain; identifying possible gaps versus joint priorities and participation of prominent
local stakeholders; reviewing existing cooperation mechanisms (info relays, training, co-
funding schemes) relevance and efficiency for MSCA; identifying main existing or
planned cooperation initiatives to build upon, as well as major local players, networks
and associations to be prioritized; qualitative monitoring of the participation in the
different MSCA calls; preparing background reports ahead of joint committee meetings
and regional dialogues; providing contributions to newsletters and periodic reports from
existing information relays, e.g. Euraxess Worldwide, EU Delegations.
• Promotion of MSCA cooperation opportunities: identifying main local/bilateral or bi-
regional events to target for MSCA promotion and opportunities for ad-hoc events co-
located with bilateral/regional policy dialogues; liaising with local MSCA info relays,
including local NCPs, Euraxess Worldwide offices, EU Delegations/S&T Counsellors,
National Erasmus+ Offices, Enterprise Europe Network and other
stakeholders/association representatives to identify coordinated promotion plans;
organising MSCA promotion and training sessions (including through the physical
participation of EU trainers when relevant); liaising with the EU NCP coordination
platform to coordinate promotion activities with MSCA NCPs
• Cross cutting activities: analysing consistency with EU R&I bilateral and bi-regional,
cooperation roadmaps and action plans, people-to-people dialogues, synergies with
promotion events and activities related to Horizon Europe, including ERC or COST and
other EU programmes (in particular Erasmus+).
The expected duration of the action is 36 months.

Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following
exceptions apply:
The granting authority can fund a maximum of one project.
The evaluation committee will be composed partially or fully by
representatives of EU institutions.
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
• More targeted and customised support for researchers at risk at European, national and
institutional level;
• Improved support to researchers at risk through the provision of policy
recommendations, as well as advice and assistance on their implementation;
• A more sustainable and professionalised support network/structure/system for
researchers at risk across Europe, facilitating access to funding and networking
opportunities, creating level playing field for applicants to European and national R&I
programmes, and raising the quality of submitted proposals;
• More synergies between initiatives supporting researchers at risk funded by EU
programmes (such as Horizon Europe and Erasmus+) and national or institutional actors;
• Increased exposure of researchers at risk to the industry and to the non-academic sector
notably through targeted networking events, professional training, mentoring and
guidance;
• Greater awareness in Europe and beyond on why researchers are at risk and ways to
support them.
Scope: Building on the available results of past and on-going Researchers at Risk initiatives100
which have strengthened support structures across the EU and provided some form of
guidance for researchers at risk, further support is envisaged for scaling up and moving
towards more customised support for researchers at risk based on the needs already identified
in the national and EU initiatives implemented so far.
Lack of regular needs-based training and targeted networking activities remains a challenge
for many researchers at risk in Europe without professional networks and direct sources of
information addressing their specific needs.
100 Eg. Inspireurope (Inspireurope - SAR Europe) ; Inspireurope+ ; MSCA4Ukraine
Page 90 of 142Moving further from solely identifying researchers’ needs, this action should aim at delivering
the best possible solutions to the challenges faced by researchers.
The support action should be aligned with the general objectives of the MSCA, in particular
scientific excellence, skills and career development, inter-sectoral mobility, equal
opportunities and inclusiveness, attractive working conditions, work/life balance, while
fostering open science, innovation and entrepreneurship. This action will place a specific
focus on training and networking activities for researchers, in line with the MSCA priorities
and as a step further in providing sustainable and needs-based professional development
support for researchers at risk across Europe.
It should not duplicate other actions foreseen under Horizon Europe or other EU-funded
programmes such as Erasmus+, but rather build synergies between these programmes. The
activities carried out under this support action should complement actions in EU Member
States and third countries associated to Horizon Europe.
The expected duration of the action is 36 months.

Specific conditions
Expected EU The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR
contribution per 1.50 and 2.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed
project appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts.
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 2.00 million.
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following
exceptions apply:
The granting authority can fund a maximum of one project.
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Page 92 of 142• Coordinated monitoring and exploitation of the contribution of Horizon 2020 and
Horizon Europe MSCA projects103 to the EU Missions104;
• Enhanced interaction between MSCA beneficiaries, researchers and policymakers, on
research results and their contribution to policy developments, and greater collaboration
among MSCA beneficiaries and researchers themselves particularly in view of possible
follow-up partnerships and funding opportunities105;
• Detailed MSCA portfolio analysis in the EU Missions areas;
• Recommendations for strengthening the policy impact of the MSCA;
• Assessment of the contribution of the MSCA to the ERA policy objectives related to
support for researchers’ training and skills development, and intersectoral cooperation;
• Strengthened synergies and complementarities between the MSCA and other relevant
EU-funded initiatives and programmes linked to the EU Missions, researchers’ training,
skills and career development and related intersectoral cooperation.
Scope: While the bottom-up nature of the MSCA is and will remain its core principle, there is
a need to have an overview of the funded research portfolio and make stronger thematic links
between MSCA projects, raise visibility of their impact on ERA priority areas and gather
stakeholder feedback on ways to maximise the MSCA impact. Given the thematic diversity of
MSCA-funded projects, the scope of this call106 cannot cover all the areas to which the MSCA
contribute. It should be seen as a pilot to map areas and types of intervention for possible
similar actions in the future that will support a broader policy feedback process.
One of the objectives of this action is to support ongoing and planned Commission
initiatives107 which focus on exploiting and assessing the impact of Horizon 2020 and Horizon
Europe projects results in relation to thematic and cross-cutting priorities, including the EU
Missions.
It also aims to assess the extent to which MSCA projects achieve two of the core horizontal
policy objectives of the programme: the development of researchers’ training, skills and
career and the related promotion of intersectoral collaboration.
Activities should therefore include the contribution and impact of MSCA projects in relation
to:
• The EU Missions and societal challenges they address;
103 This refers to MSCA Innovative Training Networks, Individual Fellowships, Research and Innovation
Staff Exchanges, COFUND, NIGHT in Horizon 2020, and MSCA Doctoral Networks, Postdoctoral
Fellowships, Staff exchanges, COFUND, MSCA and Citizens in Horizon Europe.
104 EU Missions in Horizon Europe | European Commission (europa.eu)
105 E.g. by following up outcomes and feedback received from MSCA cluster events through ensuring
interaction with and between stakeholders
106 This call is a relaunch of the call HORIZON-MSCA-2023-FTP-01
107 E.g. Horizon Results Platform, Horizon Results Booster
Page 93 of 142• Researchers’ skills development, including but not limited to the skills needed to tackle
the thematic areas of the Missions;
• Cooperation between academic and non-academic organisations108, with the emphasis on
the business sector.
The activities should contribute to strengthening complementarities between ongoing MSCA
projects, especially with a view to better exploiting their results and maximising their impact
vis-à-vis the thematic and cross-cutting priorities mentioned above.
The proposed activities should include:
• Consolidating the ongoing EU Missions cross-portfolio analysis to make full use of
MSCA projects results and analyse their contribution to each individual Mission;
• Identifying good practice examples of cooperation between academic and non-academic
organisations, with a special emphasis on the business sector as well as the main
obstacles for stronger intersectoral cooperation in MSCA;
• Identifying researchers’ training, skills and career development needs (both research-
related and transferable) to tackle societal challenges, including those covered by the
Missions;
• Exploring ways to consolidate the available training material developed in MSCA
projects, especially on transferrable skills, and exploring how to make it more broadly
accessible for further exploitation;
• Following up the existing policy feedback activities under the MSCA, particularly
through coordination with the ongoing Commission activities (cluster events, studies and
analyses) and through regular consolidation of the outcomes and deliverables of policy
feedback activities;
• Supporting/complementing existing communication and dissemination efforts by the
European Commission109 to promote and share MSCA success stories and examples of
good practice in the thematic and horizontal priorities of this call (EU Missions,
intersectoral cooperation, researchers’ training, skills and career development);
• Identifying good practice of synergies between MSCA projects and other relevant
programmes and initiatives;
• Providing practical recommendations on how to better exploit MSCA project results and
enhance impact in the areas of EU Missions, intersectoral cooperation and researchers’
skills and career development in line with the call’s objectives.
108 See definitions at the end of this Work Programme part
109 E.g.: Horizon Results Platform and Booster, Euraxess
Page 94 of 142• Analysing trends in research to feed back into the MSCA and Commission R&I policy.
Due to their bottom-up nature, the MSCA provide a valuable resource for tracking
changing research trends and can provide and evidence base for any changes in the latter
stages of Horizon Europe as well as the design of subsequent framework programmes;
The expected deliverables should include a combination of analytical reports, ad hoc policy
briefs, stakeholders’ events and meetings, policy roundtables and different communication
and dissemination support actions, such as:
- Studies, analyses, reports looking into trends and developments in MSCA relevant to:
• The EU Missions, including citizens’ engagement activities;
• Researchers’ skills and career development and training;
• Intersectoral cooperation between academia and other sectors (businesses, industry,
SMEs, public administration, civil society organisations, etc.), as well as motivation and
obstacles to engage in such cooperation;
• Examples of synergies and complementarities with other EU/national/regional
programmes and frameworks.
- Consolidation of projects results for policy feedback and communication and dissemination
purposes;
- Dissemination and networking activities using the results of cluster events and communities
of practice identified for the events; consulting project beneficiaries on policy needs,
dissemination based on reports and feedback from cluster events; providing input into
coordination of cluster events (e.g. suggesting themes, format and structure of cluster events);
- Synthesis of coordination activities linked to policy feedback and the improved exploitation
of MSCA projects results: e.g. preparatory briefings, follow-up reports, feedback
consolidation linked to MSCA cluster events, ad hoc policy briefs and monitoring of
exploitation opportunities.
The maximum duration of the action is 48 months.

1. Presidency event: MSCA Spanish Presidency Conference 2023110
The challenges the world is facing require a joint response from policymakers, society,
academia, and industry. We have witnessed how science and scientists have become, more
than ever, fundamental in the global response to current crisis. Moreover, science is also a key
dimension of the EU digital and green transitions. However, much needs to be done in order
to make even more of scientific knowledge and highly skilled professionals with a scientific
background towards addressing EU´s vision.
The role of MSCA in the following areas will be discussed in the MSCA Conference: How to
foster knowledge interfaces that better connect science, policy making, industry and society
and how to diversify scientific career paths while ensuring to nurture these interfaces, keeping
in mind the relevance of gender equality in the European Research & Innovation Area (ERA).
The Conference will target the following expected outcomes:
• MSCA towards addressing global challenges
• MSCA fostering the connection between science, policy making, industry and society
• How MSCA can contribute to diversify scientific career paths
• How MSCA can contribute to gender equality in the European Research & Innovation
Area (ERA)

3. Presidency event: MSCA Danish Presidency Conference 2025
European universities and societies are dependent on excellent researchers in academia, now
and in the future. A number of articles and surveys point out challenges in academic working
life which cause distress and health problems especially among young researchers. This may
lead to loss of excellence in academia.
The MSCA programme with its scope of excellent research and career development can
contribute to increased focus on well-being amongst and retention of young researchers in
academia by addressing different aspects affecting the working life of PhD students and
postdocs.
Page 97 of 142The conference will address:
• Career development, including funding and job opportunities in academia
• General working conditions, including working hours and job security
• Well-being, including recognition, academic fairness, independence, and management
and collegial support
• Gender/equality, including a diverse and safe work environment and equal opportunities
free of bias
• Future generations, including a view to demands from future research generations, which
may have new and untraditional expectations to working life and hence challenge the
current set-up of the academic job market and working conditions.

5. MSCA Special Needs Allowances to Horizon 2020 legacy projects
The MSCA pay particular attention to accessibility and inclusiveness and foresee financial
support for the additional costs entailed by recruited or seconded researchers/staff members
with disabilities whose long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments112 are
as such that their participation in MSCA would not be possible without extra financial
support.
112 See Article 1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Page 100 of 142Beneficiaries of Horizon 2020 ITN, IF, RISE and COFUND grants can continue to apply for a
dedicated special needs grant. This grant will cover the additional costs that researchers/staff
members with disabilities face due to the increased costs of their mobility. It can also be used
to ensure necessary assistance by third persons or for adapting their work environment113. It
cannot cover costs which are already covered by another source, such as social security or
health insurance.
The support will be granted based on the request submitted by the coordinator of the MSCA
grant (Horizon 2020 ITN, IF, RISE and COFUND grants) to the granting authority. The
request can be submitted at any moment during the implementation of the MSCA grant, when
the need arises. The request should contain a description of the special needs, the type of
support and the budget requested. The request will be evaluated by the granting authority and,
if needed, an assistance by external experts may be requested.
Once agreed, the MSCA grant agreement will be formally amended and the requested amount
for the special needs will be covered by the increase of the budget in the Management cost
category. This extra amount will be paid together with the payment of the balance. The
support will be limited to a maximum of EUR 60 000 per researcher/staff member.
Form of Funding: Grants not subject to calls for proposals

6. MSCA4Ukraine
As part of the EU’s response to the war in Ukraine and the need for rapid action, a grant was
awarded under the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2021-2022 without a call for proposals
in accordance with Article 195(b)114 of the Financial Regulation (pursuant to HORIZON-
MSCA-2022-Ukraine-ART195-IBA).
Given that the ongoing Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has caused and continues
to cause significant damage to Ukraine’s research and innovation landscape as well as to force
researchers based in Ukraine to flee the country, the need for support remains essential.
As Ukraine’s R&I infrastructure continues to be severely damaged and destroyed, it is crucial
to support researchers who will be able help rebuild the country’s R&I capacity upon their
return.
113 See Article 5 of the Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general
framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.
114 Article 195(b) of the Financial Regulation 2018/1046 “Grants may be awarded without a call for
proposals only in the following cases: […] (b) in other exceptional and duly substantiated
emergencies”.
Page 101 of 142Expected outcome
Through the provision of additional fellowships to displaced researchers from Ukraine, the
current action will further strengthen integration between the EU and Ukrainian research and
innovation communities and support Ukraine’s research and innovation capacity by allowing
displaced researchers from Ukraine to continue their research activities and expand their
expertise.
Through the provision of fellowships, training and networking opportunities to displaced
researchers from Ukraine, the grant is expected to contribute to the following expected
outcomes:
• Protection of displaced researchers from Ukraine to continue their research in academic
or non-academic organisations115 in EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated
Countries through dedicated fellowships and facilitate their reintegration to Ukraine
when safe conditions for return are met.
• Strengthened integration between the EU and Ukrainian research and innovation
communities.
At the level of individual researchers to be supported, the following outcomes are expected:
• New research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved
employability and career prospects within and outside academia.
• New knowledge allowing the conversion of ideas into products and services, where
relevant.
• Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as
with the public that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact upon
their return to Ukraine.
Expected impact
• Allow the EU to continue to support displaced researchers from Ukraine in line with its
core values, including academic freedom.
• Sustain Ukrainian research and innovation capacities by allowing displaced researchers
from Ukraine to continue their research activities and maintain their network in Ukraine.
• Reinforcement of the EU research and innovation cooperation with Ukraine
Scope
This grant will be awarded without a call for proposals according to Article 195(e) of the
Financial Regulation and Article 24(3)(b) of the Horizon Europe Regulation to the legal
entities identified below. These legal entities have a unique experience in assisting researchers
115 See definitions at the end of this Work Programme
Page 102 of 142at risk in general and researchers affected by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine in
particular. This includes providing direct financial support to researchers, giving them access
to a large network of host organisations in EU Member States and Associated countries and
building on experience acquired during the implementation of the MSCA4Ukraine grant
awarded under HORIZON-MSCA-2022-Ukraine-ART195-IBA call.
The objective of this action is to continue to provide rapid support in the form of fellowships
to displaced researchers from Ukraine to resume their research activities at host organisations
established in EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries. For this purpose,
proposals should foresee a new open call to provide support with the funding from this action,
which should follow the financial support to third parties scheme already agreed and
stipulated in the grant agreement concluded pursuant to HORIZON-MSCA-2022-Ukraine-
ART195-IBA call (and which should only differ if justified).
The beneficiaries will provide financial support to third parties in the form of unit
contributions, as stipulated in Decision of 11 March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum
contributions and unit contributions for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions under the
Horizon Europe programme. The same unit contributions as in MSCA Doctoral Networks and
MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships will be applied for doctoral candidates and postdoctoral
researchers respectively. Eligible third parties that will recruit researchers include any
academic or non-academic organisations established in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe Associated Country. Other organisations, including those established in non-
associated third countries can host researchers for short-term secondments.
This action is intended to be implemented, following an award decision, in the form of an
amendment of the grant agreement concluded pursuant to HORIZON-MSCA-2022-Ukraine-
ART195-IBA call.
The expected duration of the action is 36 months.
The evaluation committee will be composed fully by representatives of EU institutions. The
evaluation committee can be assisted by external experts if required.
The general conditions, including admissibility conditions, eligibility conditions, award
criteria, evaluation and award procedure, legal and financial set-up for grants, financial and
operational capacity and exclusion, and procedure are provided in parts A to G of the General
Annexes.

linked to a beneficiary do not have the right to claim unit contributions and may not employ
the researcher under the action. In addition, they must fulfil the eligibility conditions121 for
participation and funding applicable to the beneficiary they are linked to. The type of link and
involvement of such entities must be clearly described in the proposal and will be assessed as
part of the evaluation.
'Beneficiaries' are the legal entities that sign the grant agreement (either directly or through
an accession form) and have the responsibility for the proper implementation of the action.
They contribute directly to the implementation of the research, transfer of knowledge and
training activities. Depending on the type of MSCA action, this involves recruiting,
117 These conditions only apply to the 2024 and 2025 calls of this Work Programme. For the conditions
applying to the 2023 calls, please see the Work Programme version adopted on 6 December 2022
(European Commission Decision C(2022)7550).
118 If requested by the granting authority, institutions with self-declared research organisations status must
provide evidence that their main objective is to carry out research and/or technological development. An
assessment will be made on the basis of indicators such as share of research budget, volume of scientific
publications and/or registered patents.
119 'International European Research Organisation' (IERO) means an international organisation, the
majority of whose members are EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and
whose principal objective is to promote scientific and technological cooperation in Europe (see Article
2(15) of the Regulation establishing Horizon Europe - the Framework Programme for Research and
Innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination.
120 For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships and COFUND Postdoctoral Programmes outgoing phase, this
restriction does not apply. The associated partner hosting the outgoing phase can conclude an additional
employment contract with the researcher to ensure adequate medical/social insurance in the outgoing
country.

funding programmes.
‘Implementing partners’ means third parties implementing the MSCA COFUND Doctoral
or Postdoctoral programmes by recruiting researchers. Implementing partners can receive
financial support from the beneficiary. Implementing partners that are identified in the
proposal must include a letter of commitment before the signature of the grant agreement to
ensure their active participation in the action. The involvement of any implementing partner
for which no such evidence of commitment is submitted will not be taken into account.
‘Interdisciplinarity’ means the integration of information, data, techniques, tools,
perspectives, concepts or theories from two or more scientific disciplines. The term discipline
refers to the first level of MSCA keywords122.

123 These conditions only apply to the 2024 and 2025 calls of this Work Programme. For the conditions
applying to the 2023 calls, please see the Work Programme version adopted on 6 December 2022
(European Commission Decision C(2022)7550).
124 The indicative budget includes budget provisions for the increase of the maximum EU contribution for
grants funded under Horizon Europe MSCA Doctoral Networks calls in line with the provisions of the
decision authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie Skłodowska-
Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.
125 The pre-defined categories are as follows: EUR 3 000, EUR 4 500, EUR 6 000, EUR 9 500, EUR 13
000, EUR 18 500, EUR 27 500, EUR 35 500, EUR 47 500 and EUR 60 000.
Page 109 of 142A country correction coefficient applies to the living allowance in order to ensure equal
treatment and purchasing power parity for all researchers. This coefficient is the one
applicable to the country of the recruiting beneficiary (see Table 1 at the end of this Work
Programme part). The living allowance is a gross amount, including compulsory deductions
under national law, such as employer and employee social security contributions and direct
taxes. The beneficiary must recruit each eligible doctoral candidate under an employment
contract or equivalent direct contract, including an instrument of appointment (e.g., for
permanent staff and/or officials), with full social security coverage (including sickness,
parental, unemployment and invalidity benefits, pension rights, benefits in respect of
accidents at work and occupational diseases). An exemption from this rule can be accepted
only in cases where national legislation or the equivalent internal regulations of International
European Research Organisations (IERO), entities created under Union law, or an
international organisation, prohibit this possibility and subject to the prior agreement of the
granting authority.
When an employment contract or instrument of appointment cannot be provided, the
beneficiary may exceptionally recruit the doctoral candidate under a 'fixed-amount
fellowship'. In this case, the living allowance will be halved, and the beneficiary must ensure
that the doctoral candidate enjoys minimum social security coverage (including sickness,
parental and invalidity benefits, and benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases).
The beneficiary must pay to the doctoral candidates at least the amount of the living
allowance (minus all compulsory deductions under national legislation). A top-up may be
paid to the researchers in order to complement this contribution. In addition to the living
allowance, all doctoral candidates must receive a mobility allowance. This allowance covers
their additional, private mobility-related costs (e.g. travel and accommodation costs), not their
professional costs under the action, which are covered by the research, training and
networking contribution.
If the recruited doctoral candidate has or acquires family obligations during the action
duration, i.e. persons linked to him/her by (i) marriage, or (ii) a relationship with equivalent
status to a marriage recognised by the legislation of the country or region where this
relationship was formalised; or (iii) dependent children who are actually being maintained by
the researcher, the family allowance must be paid to him/her as well.
The long-term leave allowance contributes to the personnel costs incurred by the
beneficiaries in case of the researchers’ leave, including maternity, paternity, parental, sick or
special leave, longer than 30 consecutive days. The special needs allowance contributes to
the additional costs for the acquisition of special needs items and services for researchers with
disabilities, whose long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments126 are
certified by a competent national authority, and of such nature that their participation in the
action may not be possible without them (e.g. assistance by third persons, adaptation of work
environment, additional travel/transportation costs). These special needs items or services
126 See Article 1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Page 110 of 142must not have been funded from another source (e.g. social security or health insurance). Both
long-term leave and special needs allowances should be requested when the need arises. The
research, training and networking contribution should cover, for example, costs for
training and networking activities that contribute directly to the researchers’ career
development (e.g. participation in conferences, trips related to work on the action, training,
language courses, seminars, lab material, books, library records, publication costs), research
expenses, visa-related fees and travel expenses, additional costs arising from each secondment
of six months or less, which require mobility from the place of residence (e.g. travel and
accommodation costs).
The management and indirect contribution should cover the beneficiary’s additional costs
in connection with the action (e.g. personnel costs for project management/coordination,
indirect costs).
The above rates apply to doctoral candidates devoting themselves to their project on a full-
time basis. Researchers may, in agreement with the supervisor and beneficiary and with prior
approval by the granting authority, implement their project on a part-time basis. Such a
request is limited to personal or family reasons. In cases of part-time work, the doctoral
candidates must work at least 50% of the full working time in their recruiting organisation for
the action funded by the MSCA127. The recruiting beneficiary should report costs as pro rata
of the applicable full-time unit contributions.
1.2. Admissibility
The following exception to the General Annex A applies:
• The page limit of the application is 30 pages (excluding annexes).
1.3. Eligibility
Given the specific nature of MSCA Doctoral Networks, the following exceptions and
additional eligibility criteria apply. This section also contains eligibility conditions, which
apply during action implementation but cannot be verified at proposal stage.
• All proposals must indicate if they are resubmitted from the previous MSCA Doctoral
Networks call under Horizon Europe.
• Proposals submitted to the previous call of MSCA Doctoral Networks under Horizon
Europe and having received a score of less than 80% must not be resubmitted the
following year.
• Any proposal involving 70% or more of the same recruiting organisations as in
another proposal submitted to the previous call of the MSCA Doctoral Networks
under Horizon Europe that has received a score of less than 80% will be assessed for
whether it is a resubmission, irrespectively of the applicants’ self-declaration. The
assessment will be carried out by external expert evaluators based on the similarity of
127 An exception to this limit may be granted for medical reasons.
Page 111 of 142objectives as well as on the similarity of the scientific approach proposed to reach
such objectives.
1.3.1. Participating organisations
• Applications must be submitted by a consortium including at least three independent
legal entities, each established in a different EU Member State or Horizon Europe
Associated Country and with at least one of them established in an EU Member State.
Should none of them be entitled to award a doctoral degree, a university or a
consortium/grouping of academic/research institutions entitled to award a doctoral
degree must be added to the project as an associated partner or an associated partner
linked to a beneficiary.
• Not more than 40.0% of the EU contribution may be allocated to beneficiaries in the
same country or to a single International European Research Organisation (IERO) or
international organisation.
• International organisations with headquarters in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe Associated Country will be deemed to be established in this Member State or
Associated Country.
• Affiliated entities are not allowed to participate as they cannot claim costs in MSCA
Doctoral Networks.
• All beneficiaries must recruit at least one doctoral candidate. They are required to host
at their premises and supervise recruited researchers, or use associated partners linked
to them to do so128.
• In order to reach the objectives of Joint Doctorates, at least three independent legal
entities must be entitled to award doctoral degrees. At least one129 of the institutions
conferring a joint, double or multiple doctoral degree must be established in an EU
Member State and/or Horizon Europe Associated Country. An applicant from the
academic sector, which has transferred the right of awarding a doctoral degree to a
consortium/grouping of academic/research institutions to which it belongs to, is also
eligible. Applicants must provide, at the time of the submission of the proposal, a pre-
agreement to award a joint, double or multiple degree to the doctoral candidate(s). The
proposal should indicate from which institutions a researcher is expected to receive the
degree(s).
• Joint Doctorates must set up a joint governance structure with joint admission,
selection, supervision, monitoring and assessment procedures.
128 In exceptional cases, where a beneficiary is established in a country different from the place where the
recruited researcher is hosted, the country correction coefficient of the hosting entity is taken into
account during the grant agreement preparation process, in order to ensure the correct budget
calculation.
129 These conditions only apply to the 2024 and 2025 calls of this Work Programme. For the conditions
applying to the 2023 call, please see the Work Programme version adopted on 6 December 2022
(European Commission Decision C(2022)7550).
Page 112 of 1421.3.2. Recruited researchers
• Supported researchers must be doctoral candidates, i.e. not already in possession130
of a doctoral degree at the date of the recruitment.
• Researchers must be enrolled in a doctoral programme leading to the award of a
doctoral degree in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated
Country.
• Recruited researchers can be of any nationality and must comply with the following
mobility rule: they must not have resided or carried out their main activity131 (work,
studies, etc.) in the country of the recruiting beneficiary for more than 12 months in
the 36 months immediately before their recruitment date.
For 'International European Research Organisations' (IERO), 'international
organisations', or entities created under Union law, the researchers must not have spent
more than 12 months in the 36 months immediately before their recruitment in the
same appointing organisation.
Compulsory national service, short stays such as holidays and time spent by the
researcher as part of a procedure for obtaining refugee status under the Geneva
Convention132 are not taken into account.
• Secondments are eligible for up to one third of the actual months spent implementing
the research training activities under the action. This limitation does not apply in the
case of Industrial Doctorates and Joint Doctorates.
• In case of industrial doctorates, doctoral candidates must spend at least 50% of their
fellowship duration in the non-academic sector.
1.3.3. Duration of the action
• The duration of the action must not exceed 48 months from the starting date set out in
the grant agreement (including the time needed to recruit and select the doctoral
candidates), except in the case of joint doctorates where this maximum duration is 60
months.
• The duration of each fellowship (on the basis of full-time employment) is minimum 3
and maximum 36 months, except in the case of joint doctorates, where this maximum
duration is 48 months.
• The overall EU contribution for MSCA Doctoral Networks actions is limited to a
maximum of 540 person-months.
130 Researchers who have successfully defended their doctoral thesis but who have not yet formally been
awarded the doctoral degree will not be considered eligible.
131 Country of the main activity: the country where the researcher is physically based when carrying out the
main activity and the country of the institution for which the main activity is performed (e.g., employer)
132 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol.
Page 113 of 1421.4. Award criteria
• Proposals will be evaluated by experts on the basis of the award criteria 'excellence',
'impact' and 'quality and efficiency of the implementation'.
• Evaluation scores will be awarded for each of these criteria, and not for the different
aspects listed in the table below. Each criterion will be scored out of 5. Scores will be
awarded with a resolution of one decimal place and will be subject to a weighting
factor as indicated in the table below.
• Proposals scoring equal to or above 70% will be considered for funding — within the
limits of the available call budget. Other proposals will be rejected.

1.5. Procedure
• Proposals must be submitted to only one of eight 'main evaluation panels': Chemistry
(CHE), Social Sciences and Humanities (SOC), Economic Sciences (ECO),
Information Science and Engineering (ENG), Environment and Geosciences (ENV),
Life Sciences (LIF), Mathematics (MAT), Physics (PHY). Industrial and joint
doctorates will be ranked in the scientific panel of submission. Each panel will
establish a ranked list.
• The distribution of the indicative budget of the call will be proportional to the number
of eligible proposals received in each panel. If the budget allocated to any panel
exceeds the requirements of all proposals positively evaluated133 in that panel, the
excess budget will be reallocated to the other panels based on the distribution
described above. Equally, if the allocated funding to a panel is insufficient to fund the
highest ranked proposal in that panel, the necessary budget will be transferred from
the other panels based on the distribution described above, in order to ensure that the
highest ranked proposal can be funded. In order to ensure budget optimisation and an
equitable success rate across panels, the excess budget remaining after the initial
allocation of funding to the proposals in the panels may be transferred between panels.
Ex-aequo Proposals
• When the total scores of two or more proposals are equal (ex-aequo cases), the priority
order will be established as follows:
133 Measured as proposals having passed all relevant evaluation thresholds.
Page 115 of 1421. The proposals will be prioritised according to the scores they have been
awarded for the criterion ‘Excellence’. When these scores are equal, priority
will be based on scores for the criterion ‘Impact’.
2. If necessary, the gender balance among the supervisors named in the proposal
will be used as a factor for prioritisation.
3. If a distinction still cannot be made, the panel may decide to further prioritise
by considering other factors such as environmental considerations in line with
the MSCA Green Charter, gender and other diversity aspects in the research
activities, participation of the non-academic sector (including involvement of
SMEs), geographical diversity 134 , international cooperation, favourable
employment and working conditions or relationship to the Horizon Europe
objectives in general. These factors will be documented in the panel report.
1.6. Legal and financial set-up of the Grant Agreements
The following exceptions and additional conditions apply:
• Eligible costs must take the form of unit contributions, as stipulated in Decision of 11
March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for
Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.
• When associated partners are involved, beneficiaries are encouraged to sign a
partnership agreement with them to regulate the internal relationship between all
participating organisations. The partnership agreement(s) must comply with the grant
agreement.
• Beneficiaries must ensure full access — on a royalty-free basis — for the recruited
researchers to background and results needed for their activities under the action.
• The following deliverables will have to be submitted for grants awarded under this
topic:
− establishment of a supervisory board of the network;
− progress report submitted within 30 days after one year from the starting date of
the action;
− mid-term meeting organised between the participants and the granting authority;

2. MSCA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
2.1. Applicable unit contributions135
The EU contribution for MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships will take the form of unit
contributions, as stipulated in Decision of 11 March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum
contributions and unit contributions for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon
Europe Programme136.

135 These conditions only apply to the 2024 and 2025 calls of this Work Programme. For the conditions
applying to the 2023 calls, please see the Work Programme version adopted on 6 December 2022
(European Commission Decision C(2022)7550).
136 The indicative budget includes budget provisions for the increase of the maximum EU contribution for
grants funded under Horizon Europe MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships calls in line with the provisions
of the decision authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie
Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.
137 The pre-defined categories are as follows: EUR 3 000, EUR 4 500, EUR 6 000, EUR 9 500, EUR
13 000, EUR 18 500, EUR 27 500, EUR 35 500, EUR 47 500 and EUR 60 000.
Page 117 of 142A country correction coefficient applies to the living allowance in order to ensure equal
treatment and purchasing power parity for all researchers138. For European Postdoctoral
Fellowships, this coefficient is the one applicable to the country of the beneficiary. For the
Global Postdoctoral Fellowships two different country correction coefficients apply:
- For the outgoing phase: the coefficient of the country where the postdoctoral
researcher is hosted (i.e. the country of the associated partner hosting the outgoing
phase);
- For the return phase: the coefficient of the country where the postdoctoral researcher
returns to (i.e. the country of the beneficiary).
The country correction coefficients are listed in Table 1 at the end of this Work Programme
part. The living allowance is a gross amount, including compulsory deductions under national
law, such as employer and employee social security contributions and direct taxes.
The beneficiary must recruit the postdoctoral researcher under an employment contract or
equivalent direct contract, including an instrument of appointment (e.g., for permanent staff
and/or officials), with full social security coverage (including sickness, parental,
unemployment and invalidity benefits, pension rights, benefits in respect of accidents at work
and occupational diseases). An exemption from this rule can be accepted only in cases where
national legislation or the equivalent internal regulations of International European Research
Organisations (IERO), entities created under Union law, or an international organisation,
prohibit this possibility and subject to the prior agreement of the granting authority.
When an employment contract or instrument of appointment cannot be provided, the
beneficiary may exceptionally recruit the postdoctoral researcher under a 'fixed-amount
fellowship'. In this case, the living allowance will be halved, and the beneficiary must ensure
that the postdoctoral researcher enjoys minimum social security coverage (including sickness,
parental and invalidity benefits, and benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases).
The beneficiary must pay to the postdoctoral researcher at least the amount of the living
allowance (minus all compulsory deductions under national legislation). A top-up may be
paid to the researcher in order to complement this contribution. In addition to the living
allowance, the postdoctoral researcher must receive a mobility allowance. This allowance
covers his/her additional, private mobility-related costs (e.g. travel and accommodation costs),
not professional costs under the action, which are covered by the research, training and
networking contribution.
If the postdoctoral researcher has or acquires family obligations during the action duration,
i.e. has persons linked to him/her by (i) marriage, or (ii) a relationship with equivalent status
138 In exceptional cases, where a beneficiary is established in a country different from the place where the
recruited researcher is hosted, the country correction coefficient of the hosting entity is taken into
account during the grant agreement preparation process, in order to ensure the correct budget
calculation.
Page 118 of 142to a marriage recognised by the legislation of the country or region where this relationship
was formalised; or (iii) dependent children who are actually being maintained by the
researcher, the family allowance must be paid to him/her as well.
The long-term leave allowance contributes to the personnel costs incurred by the beneficiary
in case of the researcher’s leave, including maternity, paternity, parental, sick or special leave,
longer than 30 consecutive days. The special needs allowance contributes to the additional
costs for the acquisition of special needs items and services for researchers with disabilities,
whose long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments139 are certified by a
competent national authority, and of such nature that their participation in the action may not
be possible without them (e.g. assistance by third persons, adaptation of work environment,
additional travel/transportation costs). These special needs items or services must not have
been funded from another source (e.g. social security or health insurance). Both long-term
leave and special needs allowances should be requested when the need arises.
The research, training and networking contribution should cover, for example, costs for
training and networking activities that contribute directly to the researchers’ career
development (e.g. participation in conferences, trips related to work on the action, training,
language courses, seminars, lab material, books, library records, publication costs), research
expenses, visa-related fees and travel expenses, additional costs arising from optional
secondments (e.g. travel and accommodation costs).
The management and indirect contribution should cover the beneficiary’s additional costs
in connection with the action (e.g. personnel costs for project management, indirect costs).
The above rates apply to postdoctoral researchers devoting themselves to their project on a
full-time basis. Researchers may, in agreement with the supervisor and beneficiary and with
prior approval by the granting authority, implement their project on a part-time basis. In
addition to the possibility to request part-time work for personal or family reasons,
postdoctoral fellows may opt to work part-time for professional reasons. These might include
creating a company, pursuing another research project140, or engaging in advanced studies not
related to the MSCA grant. Part-time work for professional reasons is not allowed during the
outgoing phase of the Global Postdoctoral Fellowships. Any professional activities carried out
part-time in parallel with the MSCA action must be agreed upon by the researcher and the
beneficiary and approved by the granting authority.
If the action is implemented on a part-time basis, the researcher must dedicate at least 50% of
his/her working time to the action funded by the MSCA141. The beneficiary should report
costs as pro rata of the applicable full-time unit contributions.
2.2. Admissibility
The following exceptions to the General Annex A apply:
139 See Article 1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
140 Part-time work cannot be requested in order to participate in another MSCA grant at the same time.
141 An exception to this limit may be granted for medical reasons.
Page 119 of 142• The page limit of the application is 10 pages (excluding annexes).
2.3. Eligibility
Given the specific nature of MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships, the following exceptions and
additional eligibility criteria apply. This section also contains eligibility conditions, which
apply during action implementation but cannot be verified at proposal stage.
• All domains of research and technological development are eligible for funding
(including areas of research covered by the Euratom Research and Training
Programme 2021-2025).
• Proposals involving the same recruiting organisation (and for Global Postdoctoral
Fellowships also the associated partner hosting the outgoing phase) and individual
researcher submitted to the previous call of MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships under
Horizon Europe and having received a score of less than 70% must not be resubmitted
the following year.
• Only one proposal per individual researcher can be submitted. In case of several
proposals involving the same individual researcher, only the last submitted one will be
considered eligible.
• If proposals with the same research objectives and work plan are submitted for
different researchers, only the first submitted one will be considered eligible.
2.3.1. Participating organisations
• Applications must be submitted by a single independent legal entity, established in an
EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. This is a mono-beneficiary
action.
• The associated partner hosting the outgoing phase in Global Postdoctoral Fellowships
must include a letter of commitment in the proposal to ensure their active participation
in the action.
• Applications in the research areas of research covered by the Euratom Research and
Training Programme 2021-2025 must be submitted by a single independent legal
entity, established in an EU Member State or a country associated to the Euratom
Research and Training Programme 2021-2025. Nuclear-related proposals submitted by
entities established in other countries will be ineligible142.
• Affiliated entities are not allowed to participate as they cannot claim costs in MSCA
Postdoctoral Fellowships.
142 See Euratom Work Programme 2021-2025 and the Horizon Europe Programme guide available on the
Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-
tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/reference-documents;programCode=HORIZON)
for up-to-date information on the current list of countries associated to the Euratom Programme.
Page 120 of 142• International organisations with headquarters in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe Associated Country will be deemed to be established in this Member State or
Associated Country.
• The beneficiary must employ and supervise the researcher during the action.
2.3.2. Recruited researchers
• Supported fellows must be postdoctoral researchers at the date of the call deadline,
i.e. in a possession of a doctoral degree143. Applicants who have successfully defended
their doctoral thesis but who have not yet formally been awarded the doctoral degree
will also be considered as postdoctoral researchers and will be considered eligible to
apply. The successful defence must be unconditional (no further
requirements/corrections that need to be addressed) and take place before the call
deadline. Supporting documentation may be requested.
• At the call deadline, supported researchers must have a maximum of 8 years full-
time equivalent experience in research, measured from the date of award of the
doctoral degree. Years of experience outside research and career breaks (e.g. due to
parental leave144), will not count towards the amount of research experience. For
nationals or long-term residents of EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated
Countries who wish to reintegrate to pursue their research career in EU Member States
or Horizon Europe Associated Countries, years of experience in research in third
countries will not be considered in the above maximum.
• Recruited researchers must comply with the following mobility rule: they must not
have resided or carried out their main activity145 (work, studies, etc.) in the country of
the beneficiary (for European Postdoctoral Fellowships), or the host organisation for
the outgoing phase (for Global Postdoctoral Fellowships) for more than 12 months in
the 36 months immediately before the call deadline.
Researchers wishing to reintegrate from a third country must either be based in a third

Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country within the last 12 months before
the call deadline.
143 A medical doctor degree will be accepted only when it corresponds to a doctoral degree or if the
researcher can demonstrate his/her appointment in a position that requires doctoral equivalency (e.g.
professorship appointment). Medical doctor degrees corresponding to basic medical training as defined
in Annex V of Directive 2005/36/EC will not be considered a doctoral degree
144 Maternity: for each child born within the above-mentioned eligibility period of 8 years, 18 months will
be deducted from the experience in research unless the applicant can document a longer parental leave
prior to the call deadline. Paternity: for each child born within the above-mentioned eligibility period of
8 years, the documented time of parental leave taken until the call deadline will be deducted from the
experience in research.
145 Country of the main activity: the country where the researcher is physically based when carrying out the
main activity and the country of the institution for which the main activity is performed (e.g.,
employer).
Page 121 of 142For 'International European Research Organisations' (IERO), 'international
organisations', or entities created under Union law, the researchers must not have spent
more than 12 months in the 36 months immediately before the call deadline, in the
same appointing organisation.
Compulsory national service, short stays such as holidays and time spent as part of a
procedure for obtaining refugee status under the Geneva Convention146 are not taken
into account.
• Supported researchers can be of any nationality. However, researchers going to a
third country (‘Global Postdoctoral Fellowship) or researchers who wish to reintegrate
to Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country), must
be nationals or long-term residents of EU Member States or Horizon Europe
Associated Countries. Long-term residence means a period of legal and continuous
residence within EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries of at
least five consecutive years. Absences of less than six consecutive months and no
more than ten months over the whole period are permitted when calculating the five
years.
Researchers who are refugees in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated
Country according to the Geneva Convention may also apply to both European and
Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, irrespective of whether they are long-term residents
or not, if they fulfil the other eligibility conditions.
• Applicants in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training
Programme 2021-2025 must recruit nationals or long-term residents of an EU Member
State or a country associated to the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-

2.3.3. Duration of the action
• European Postdoctoral Fellowships should last between 12 and 24 months. Global
Postdoctoral Fellowships should last between 24 and 36 months, consisting of 12 to 24
months for the outgoing phase and 12 months for the return phase.
• If requested and justified in the proposal, an additional period of up to six months at
the end of the project can be awarded to researchers who will spend that period in a
non-academic organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe
Associated Country.
2.4. Award criteria
• Proposals will be evaluated by experts on the basis of the award criteria 'excellence',
'impact' and 'quality and efficiency of the implementation'.

In Postdoctoral Fellowships, proposals will be evaluated by one of eight 'main evaluation
panels': Chemistry (CHE), Social Sciences and Humanities (SOC), Economic Sciences
(ECO), Information Science and Engineering (ENG), Environment and Geosciences (ENV),
Life Sciences (LIF), Mathematics (MAT), Physics (PHY). Each panel will establish two
ranked lists, one for European and one for Global Postdoctoral Fellowships.
European and Global Postdoctoral Fellowships will have separate budgets. The distribution of
respective available funds will be proportional to the number of eligible proposals received in
each main evaluation panel. If the budget allocated to any panel exceeds the requirements of
all proposals positively evaluated147 in that panel, the excess budget will be reallocated to the
other panels based on the distribution as above. Equally, if the allocated funding to a panel is
insufficient to fund the highest ranked proposal in that panel, the necessary budget will be
transferred from the other panels based on the distribution as above, in order to ensure that the
highest ranked proposal can be funded. In order to ensure budget optimisation and an
equitable success rate across panels, the excess budget remaining after the initial allocation of
funding to the proposals in the panels may be transferred between panels.
Ex-aequo Proposals
• When the total scores of two or more proposals are equal (ex-aequo cases), the priority
order will be established as follows:
1. The proposals will be prioritised according to the scores they have been
awarded for the criterion ‘Excellence’. When these scores are equal, priority
will be based on scores for the criterion ‘Impact’.
2. If necessary, the gender balance among successful applicant researchers will be
used as a factor for prioritisation.
If a distinction still cannot be made, the panel may decide to further prioritise by considering
other factors such as environmental considerations in line with the MSCA Green Charter,
gender and other diversity aspects in the research activities, participation of the non-academic
sector (including involvement of SMEs), geographical diversity148, favourable employment
and working conditions or relationship to the Horizon Europe objectives in general. These
factors will be documented in the panel report.
Seal of Excellence
• Seals of Excellence will be awarded to applications with a total score equal to or
higher than 85%, but which cannot be funded due to lack of budget available to the
call.

(European Commission Decision C(2022)7550).
158 The indicative budget includes budget provisions for the increase of the maximum EU contribution for
grants funded under Horizon Europe MSCA COFUND calls in line with the provisions of the decision
authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie Skłodowska-Curie
actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.

The COFUND allowance contributes to:
- costs of the researchers including the remuneration payable to the individual doctoral
or postdoctoral researchers recruited under an employment contract/equivalent direct
contract with full social security coverage and complying with the applicable social
security legislation, as well as the mobility costs and, if applicable, the family costs,
and/or
- costs related to the training, research expenses, transfer of knowledge and networking
activities of researchers, costs of managing the action and indirect costs.
The long-term leave allowance contributes to the personnel costs incurred by the employer
in case of the researchers’ leave, including maternity, paternity, parental, sick or special leave,
longer than 30 consecutive days. The special needs allowance contributes to the additional
costs for the acquisition of special needs items and services for researchers with disabilities,
whose long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments160 are certified by a
competent national authority, and of such nature that their participation in the action may not
be possible without them (e.g. assistance by third persons, adaptation of work environment,
additional travel/transportation costs). These special needs items or services must not have
been funded from another source (e.g. social security or health insurance). Both long-term
leave and special needs allowances should be requested when the need arises.
The beneficiary or implementing partner must recruit each eligible researcher under an
employment contract or 'equivalent direct contract' with full social security coverage
(including sickness, parental, unemployment and invalidity benefits, pension rights, benefits
in respect of accidents at work and occupational diseases). An exemption from this rule can
be accepted only in cases where national legislation or the equivalent internal regulations of
International European Research Organisations (IERO), entities created under Union law, or
an international organisation, prohibit this possibility and subject to the prior agreement of the
granting authority.
When an employment contract cannot be provided, the beneficiary or the implementing
partner may exceptionally recruit the researcher under a 'fixed-amount fellowship'. In this
159 The pre-defined categories are as follows: EUR 3 000, EUR 4 500, EUR 6 000, EUR 9 500, EUR 13
000, EUR 18 500, EUR 27 500, EUR 35 500, EUR 47 500 and EUR 60 000.
160 See Article 1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Page 132 of 142case, the COFUND allowance will be halved and the beneficiary must ensure that the
researcher enjoys minimum social security coverage (including sickness, parental and
invalidity benefits, and benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases).
In principle, researchers should be employed full-time. The above rates apply to researchers
devoting themselves to their project on a full-time basis. Researchers may, in agreement with
the supervisor and beneficiary and with prior approval by the granting authority, implement
their project on a part-time basis. Part-time work due to professional reasons can be requested
by COFUND postdoctoral researchers only.
In cases of part-time work, researchers must work at least 50% of the full working time in
their recruiting organisation for the action co-funded by the MSCA, whether they are working
part-time for family or other reasons161. The beneficiary should report costs as pro rata of the
applicable full-time unit contributions.
The EU contribution is limited to EUR 10 million per beneficiary per call. If an applicant
submits two or more successful applications totalling more than EUR 10 million within one
call, the applicant will be required to decide which of these proposals to implement.
The table above specifies the unit contributions for the co-funding of regional, national and
international programmes. The EU contribution can be used to support any cost items of the
programme (remuneration costs, mobility costs, family costs, research, training and
networking costs, management and indirect costs). Individual cost items may be fully or
partially funded through other resources including EU programmes other than Horizon 2020
or Horizon Europe, such as the Cohesion policy funds, provided that double funding is
avoided.
Applicants must specify in their proposal the total cost of their proposed programme and in
particular the amounts that will be provided for the benefit of the researchers and for the
organisation(s) that will implement the programme. This information will be needed to
evaluate the adequateness of employment and working conditions of the researchers. The
monthly gross remuneration, i.e. salaries, social security contributions, taxes and other costs
or compulsory deductions under national legislation linked to in the remuneration, and the
mobility costs for the benefit of the researchers must be:
- For researchers recruited under an employment contract: not lower than EUR 3300
(for doctoral candidates) and EUR 4700 (for postdoctoral researchers);
- For researchers recruited under a fixed-amount fellowship: not lower than EUR 1400
(for doctoral candidates) and EUR 1990 (for postdoctoral researchers).
4.2. Admissibility
The following exceptions to the General Annex A apply:
• The page limit of the application is 30 pages (excluding annexes).
161 An exception to this limit may be granted for medical reasons.
Page 133 of 142• Where doctoral or postdoctoral programmes are implemented as financial support
to third parties through implementing partners, applications do not need to include
a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results, including communication
activities, because the scope of these activities will not be known at application
stage.
4.3. Eligibility
Given the specific nature of MSCA COFUND, the following exceptions and additional
eligibility criteria apply. This section also contains eligibility conditions, which apply during
action implementation but cannot be verified at proposal stage.
4.3.1. Participating organisations
• Applications must be submitted by a single entity established in an EU Member State
or Horizon Europe Associated Country.
• Affiliated entities are not allowed to participate as they cannot claim costs in MSCA
COFUND.
• The conditions for financial support to third parties defined in General Annex B do not
apply.
• International organisations with headquarters in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe Associated Country will be deemed to be established in this Member State or
Associated Country.
• The beneficiary will be responsible for the availability of the necessary
complementary funds to implement the proposal.
• In each COFUND action, a minimum of three researchers must be recruited.
COFUND proposals foreseeing research training for fewer than three researchers will
be deemed ineligible.
• Implementing partners must be established in one of the countries eligible for funding
listed in the General Annexes.
4.3.2. Recruited researchers
• Recruited researchers can be of any nationality (see also specific condition for
COFUND Postdoctoral Programmes below) and must comply with the following
mobility rule162: they must not have resided or carried out their main activity163
(work, studies, etc.) in the country of the recruiting beneficiary or implementing
162 Existing programmes with international mobility applying for COFUND can deviate from this rule if
duly justified in the proposal by the applicant. The existing mobility rule will be evaluated by the
independent experts to judge if it is in the spirit of the MSCA mobility rule.
163 Country of the main activity: the country where the researcher is physically based when carrying out the
main activity and the country of the institution for which the main activity is performed (e.g., employer)

the co-funded programme's call.
For International European Research Organisations’ (IERO), 'international
organisations' or entities created under Union law, the researchers must not have spent
more than 12 months in the 36 months immediately before the deadline of the co-
funded programme's call, in the same appointing organisation.
Compulsory national service, short stays such as holidays and time spent as part of a
procedure for obtaining refugee status under the Geneva Convention164 are not taken
into account.
• Supported researchers must be either doctoral candidates or postdoctoral researchers,
depending on the action:
o For COFUND Doctoral Programmes, researchers must be doctoral candidates,
i.e. not already in possession165 of a doctoral degree at the deadline of the co-
funded programme's call.
Researchers must be enrolled in a doctoral programme leading to the award of
a doctoral degree in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe
Associated Country.
o For COFUND Postdoctoral Programmes, researchers must be in possession of
a doctoral degree166 at the deadline of the co-funded programme's call.
Researchers who have successfully defended their doctoral thesis but who have
not yet formally been awarded the doctoral degree will also be considered as
postdoctoral researchers and will be considered eligible to apply. The
successful defence must be unconditional (no further requirements/corrections
that need to be addressed) and take place before the call deadline. Supporting
documentation may be requested.
• For COFUND Postdoctoral Programmes: researchers must be nationals or long-term
residents of an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country, in case the
main part of the research training activities is carried out in a country other than an EU
Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.
• Limitations regarding the researchers' origin and destination should be avoided.
Researchers who are already permanently employed by the organisation hosting them
cannot be funded by COFUND.
164 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol.
165 Researchers who have successfully defended their doctoral thesis but who have not yet formally been
awarded the doctoral degree will not be considered eligible.
166 A medical doctor degree will be accepted only when it corresponds to a doctoral degree or if the
researcher can demonstrate his/her appointment in a position that requires doctoral equivalency (e.g.
professorship appointment). Medical doctor degrees corresponding to basic medical training as defined
in Annex V of Directive 2005/36/EC will not be considered a doctoral degree.
Page 135 of 1424.3.3. Duration of the action
• The maximum duration of the action must be 60 months from the starting date set out
in the grant agreement. It also includes the time that is needed to select and recruit the
researchers.
• The minimum duration of each fellowship (on the basis of full-time employment)
must be three months.
• For Postdoctoral Programmes where the main part of the research training activity
does not take place in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country
(i.e. outgoing phase), the researcher should carry out a mandatory return period of 12
months at the premises of the beneficiary or the recruiting implementing partner. A
maximum of three months can be spent at the start of the action at the beneficiary (or
any other organisation mentioned in the description of the action), allowing the
researcher to spend time there before the outgoing phase. Secondments cannot take
place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host organisation in an
EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.
• The duration of the secondments should be limited to a maximum of one third of the
actual months spent implementing the research training activities under the action or,
if applicable, of the duration of the outgoing phase for Postdoctoral Programmes.
4.4. Award criteria
• Proposals will be evaluated by experts on the basis of the award criteria 'excellence',
'impact' and 'quality and efficiency of the implementation'.
• Evaluation scores will be awarded for each of these criteria, and not for the different
aspects listed in the table below. Each criterion will be scored out of 5. Scores will be
awarded with a resolution of one decimal place and will be subject to a weighting
factor as indicated in the table below.
• Proposals scoring equal to or above 70% will be considered for funding — within the
limits of the available call budget. Other proposals will be rejected.

Page 137 of 1424.5. Procedure
• In COFUND, the evaluation will be organised in two different panels, Doctoral
Programmes and Postdoctoral Programmes, but a single ranking list will be produced.
Ex-aequo Proposals
• When the total scores of two or more proposals are equal (ex-aequo cases), the priority
order will be established as follows:
The proposals will be prioritised according to the scores they have been
awarded for the criterion ‘Excellence’. When these scores are equal, priority
will be based on scores for the criterion ‘Impact’. If a distinction still cannot be
made, the panel may decide to further prioritise by considering other factors
such as environmental considerations in line with the MSCA Green Charter,
gender and other diversity aspects in the research activities, participation of the
non-academic sector (including involvement of SMEs), geographical
diversity 167 , synergies with Cohesion policy funds, support to Smart
Specialisation Strategies, or relationship to the Horizon Europe objectives in
general. These factors will be documented in the panel report.
Seal of Excellence
Seals of Excellence will be awarded to applications with a total score equal to or
higher than 85%, but which cannot be funded due to lack of budget available to the
call.
4.6. Legal and financial set-up of the Grant Agreements
The following exceptions and additional conditions apply:
• Eligible costs must take the form of unit contributions, as stipulated in Decision of 11
