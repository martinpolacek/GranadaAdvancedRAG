and each established in a different country as follows:
5- at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State;
- and at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different EU
Member States, Norway or Iceland.
As affiliated entities do not sign the grant agreement, they do not count towards the minimum
eligibility criteria for consortium composition (if any).
The Joint Research Centre, international European research organisations and legal entities
created under EU law are deemed to be established in a Member State other than those in which
the other legal entities participating in the action are established.
Additional Eligibility Requirements
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests,
autonomy, or security, and in accordance with Article 197(3) Financial Regulation, this action

(a), the eligible legal entity is established in an EU Member State, Norway and Iceland and its
executive management structures are established in that Member State and/or country;
(b), the eligible legal entity commits to carry out all relevant activities in one or more EU
Member States, Norway and Iceland; and
(c), the eligible legal entity is not to be subject to control by a third country or by a third country
entity.

over a legal entity directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediate legal entities. The
reference to third country above shall be understood as any country other than EU Member
State, Norway or Iceland.
Declaration of ownership and control
A compulsory questionnaire on the declaration of ownership and control is to be filled by all
project participants as part of the application. All declarations must be assembled by the
coordinator and uploaded in a single file in the portal submission system. For successfully
evaluated proposals that enter into Grant Agreement Preparation, an assessment of the
ownership and control shall take place by the granting authority. Failure to demonstrate
condition (c) above shall result in non-eligibility of the participant.
7. FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL CAPACITY AND EXCLUSION
Financial capacity
Applicants must have stable and sufficient resources to successfully implement the projects
and contribute their share. Organisations participating in several projects must have sufficient
capacity to implement all these projects.
The financial capacity check will be carried out on the basis of the documents you will be
6requested to upload in the Participant Register during grant preparation (e.g. profit and loss
account and balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an approved external
auditor, certifying the accounts for the last closed financial year, etc). The analysis will be
based on neutral financial indicators, but will also take into account other aspects, such as
dependency on EU funding and deficit and revenue in previous years.
The check will normally be done for all beneficiaries, except:
- public bodies (entities established as public body under national law, including local,
regional or national authorities) or international organisations
- if the individual requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60 000.
If needed, it may also be done for affiliated entities.
If we consider that your financial capacity is not satisfactory, we may require
- further information
- an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility for all
beneficiaries or joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see below, section 10)
- prefinancing paid in instalments
- (one or more) prefinancing guarantees (see below, section 10)
or
- propose no prefinancing
- request that you are replaced or, if needed, reject the entire proposal.
For more information, see Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Operational capacity
Applicants must have the know-how, qualifications and resources to successfully
implement the projects and contribute their share (including sufficient experience in projects
of comparable size and nature). This capacity will be assessed together with the ‘Quality’
award criterion on the basis of the competence and experience of the applicants and their
project teams, including operational resources (human, technical and other) or, exceptionally,
the measures proposed to obtain it by the time the task implementation starts.
If the evaluation of the award criterion is positive, the applicants are considered to have
sufficient operational capacity. Applicants will have to show their operational capacity via
the following information:
- general profiles (qualifications and experience) of the staff responsible for managing
and implementing the project
- description of the consortium participants
- list of previous projects (key projects for the last 4 years; template available in Part B).
Additional supporting documents may be requested, if needed to confirm the operational
capacity of any applicant. Public bodies, Member State organisations and international
organisations are exempted from the operational capacity check.
Exclusion
7Applicants which are subject to an EU exclusion decision or in one of the following
exclusion situations that bar them from receiving EU funding can NOT participate2:
- bankruptcy, winding up, affairs administered by the courts, arrangement with creditors,
suspended business activities or other similar procedures (including procedures for persons
with unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts)
- in breach of social security or tax obligations (including if done by persons with
unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts)
- guilty of grave professional misconduct3 (including if done by persons having powers
of representation, decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential
for the award/implementation of the grant)
- committed fraud, corruption, links to a criminal organisation, money laundering,
terrorism-related crimes (including terrorism financing), child labour or human trafficking
(including if done by persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the award/implementation of the grant
- shown significant deficiencies in complying with main obligations under an EU
procurement contract, grant agreement, prize, expert contract, or similar (including if done by
persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control, beneficial owners or
persons who are essential for the award/implementation of the grant)
- guilty of irregularities within the meaning of Article 1(2) of EU Regulation 2988/95
(including if done by persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the award/implementation of the grant)
- created under a different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social or other
legal obligations in the country of origin or created another entity with this purpose
(including if done by persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the award/implementation of the grant).
Professional misconduct includes: violation of ethical standards of the profession, wrongful
conduct with impact on professional credibility, false declarations/misrepresentation of
information, participation in a cartel or other agreement distorting competition, violation of
IPR, attempting to influence decision-making processes or obtain confidential information
from public authorities to gain advantage.
Applicants will also be rejected if it turns out that:
- during the award procedure they misrepresented information required as a condition for
participating or failed to supply that information
- they were previously involved in the preparation of the call and this entails a distortion
of competition that cannot be remedied otherwise (conflict of interest)
8. EVALUATION AND AWARD
The proposals will have to follow the standard submission and evaluation procedure (one-
stage submission + one-step evaluation).
An evaluation committee (assisted by independent outside experts) will assess all
2 See Articles 136 and 141 of EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
3 Professional misconduct includes: violation of ethical standards of the profession, wrongful conduct with
impact on professional credibility, false declarations/misrepresentation of information, participation in a cartel
or other agreement distorting competition, violation of IPR, attempting to influence decision-making processes
or obtain confidential information from public authorities to gain advantage.
8applications. Proposals will first be checked for formal requirements (admissibility, and
eligibility, see sections 5 and 6). Proposals found admissible and eligible will be evaluated
against the operational capacity and award criteria (see sections 7 and 9) and then ranked
according to their scores.
For proposals with the same score (within a topic or budget envelope) a priority order will be
determined according to the following approach:
Successively for every group of ex aequo proposals, starting with the highest scored group, and
continuing in descending order:
1) The ex aequo proposals within the same topic will be prioritised according to the
scores they have been awarded for the award criterion ‘Relevance’. When these scores
are equal, priority will be based on their scores for the criterion ‘Impact’. When these
scores are equal, priority will be based on their scores for the criterion ‘Quality’.
2) If this does not allow to determine the priority, a further prioritisation can be done
by considering the overall project portfolio and the creation of positive synergies
between projects, or other factors related to the objectives of the call. These factors will
be documented in the panel report.
The award criteria for this call are as follows:
1) Relevance (40 points):
- Background and general objectives
- Needs analysis and specific objectives
- Complementarity with other actions and innovation – European added value
2) Quality (40 points)
- Concept and methodology
- Consortium set-up, Project teams, staff and experts
- Effectiveness of the work plan
- Consortium management and decision-making
- Project management, quality assurance and monitoring and evaluation strategy
- Cost effectiveness and financial management
- Effectiveness of the work plan
- Risk management
3) Impact (20 points)
- Impact and ambition
9- Communication, dissemination and visibility
- Sustainability and continuation
Award Criteria Minimum Pass score Maximum score
Relevance 21 40
Quality 21 40
Impact 11 20
Overall (pass) score 60 100
All proposals will be informed about the evaluation result (evaluation result letter).
Successful proposals will be invited for grant preparation; the other ones will be put on the
reserve list or rejected.
No commitment for funding — Invitation to grant preparation does NOT constitute a formal
commitment for funding. We will still need to make various legal checks before grant award:
legal entity validation, financial capacity, exclusion check, etc.
Grant preparation will involve a dialogue in order to fine-tune technical or financial aspects
of the project and may require extra information from your side. It may also include
adjustments to the proposal to address recommendations of the evaluation committee or other
concerns. Compliance will be a pre-condition for signing the grant.
If you believe that the evaluation procedure was flawed, you can submit a complaint
(following the deadlines and procedures set out in the evaluation result letter). Please note that
notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending will be considered to
have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from opening/access (see also Funding
& Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions). Please also be aware that for complaints submitted
electronically, there may be character limitations.
9. LEGAL AND FINANCIAL SET-UP OF THE GRANTS
If you pass evaluation, your project will be invited for grant preparation, where you will be
asked to prepare the Grant Agreement together with the EU Project Officer.
This Grant Agreement will set the framework for your grant and its terms and conditions, in
particular concerning deliverables, reporting and payments. The Model Grant Agreement that
will be used (and all other relevant templates and guidance documents) can be found on Portal
Reference Documents.

Defence Fund (EDF) restricted calls
Version 0.1 — DRAFT
20 December 2021EU Grants: Participation in DEP, HE and EDF restricted calls: V0.1 – 20.12.2021— DRAFT
IMPORTANT NOTICE
Under the new MFF 2021-2027, participation in certain calls for proposals launched under
some of the Programmes (European Defence Fund, Horizon Europe, and Digital Europe) may
be restricted to legal entities established in Member States (or in specified eligible third
countries). In accordance with the relevant basic acts, in certain cases, legal entities
established in Member States (or in specified eligible third countries) can participate in the
calls for proposals only if they are directly or indirectly controlled by Member States or by
nationals of Member States (or by entities or nationals of specified eligible countries). These
restrictions apply for duly justified security reasons, where they are necessary to protect
essential security and/or defence interests of the Union and/or its Member States or to
maintain public order and public security. With respect to certain calls for proposals, the legal
entities in question may be eligible to participate only if they comply with certain
requirements (provide guarantees).
The calls that are subject to such restrictions and the precise conditions for each call are set
out, for each Programme, in the Work Programmes published on the Funding & Tenders
Portal. In the case of the European Defence Fund, they apply to the whole Programme.
This guidance is designed to help applicants that wish to apply in such restricted calls to
become aware of the requirements, in particular, the ownership control assessment procedure
that will be conducted to determine control and the guarantees that may be required if
control by an (ineligible) third country, a third country entity or a third country national is
confirmed.
It gives details on how EU services intend to apply the relevant criteria and how applicants
may provide the guarantees.
This document aims at developing a corporate approach to the eligibility requirements set out
in the various Programme Regulations. For the time being, it is published only as a draft,
pending final adoption. The int ention is to test this approach in practice and take stock of the
user-feedback and operational experience before endorsing it in a more formal way, in order
to be able to fine-tune or revise the approach for future calls, if needed.
Until then, it can be used by the applicants for reference for the calls concerned.
This draft guidance was prepared by and expresses the views of the Commission services and
does not commit the European Commission. Only the Court of Justice of the European Union
is competent to authoritatively interpret Union law.
In the future this draft Guidance might be extended to other EU programmes.

1. Background
Under the new MFF 2021-2027, participation in certain calls for proposals launched
under some of the Programmes (European Defence Fund, Horizon Europe, and Digital
Europe) may be restricted to legal entities established in Member States (or in
specified eligible third countries). In accordance with the relevant basic acts, in certain
cases, legal entities established in Member States (or in specified eligible third
countries) can participate in the calls for proposals only if they are directly or
indirectly controlled by Member States or by nationals of Member States (or by
entities or nationals of specified eligible countries). These restrictions apply for duly
justified security reasons, where they are necessary to protect essential security
and/or defence interests of the Union and/or its Member States or to maintain public
order and public security. With respect to certain calls for proposals, the legal entities
in question may be eligible to participate only if they comply with certain requirements
(provide guarantees).
Some EU funding programmes provide that, in addition to the standard eligibility
conditions, certain calls for proposals may further restrict participation (‘restricted
calls’) to:
 legal entities that are established in Member States and specified eligible
countries (type 1);
and/or
 legal entities that are established in Member States and specifiied eligible
countries and controlled by Member States/Member States nationals and
eligible countries/eligible country entities (type 2).
Such restrictions are in principle allowed in the following programmes:
 Digital Europe (DEP), for actions under specific objectives 1 (High Performance
Computing), 2 (Artificial Intelligence) and 3 (Cybersecurity and Trust) (Article
12(5)-(6) and 18(4) Digital Europe Regulation 2021/694);
 European Defence Fund (EDF), for all actions (Article 9 EDF Regulation
2021/697);
 Horizon Europe (HE), for actions related to EU strategic assets, interests,
autonomy or security (Article 22(5) of Horizon Europe Regulation (EU)
2021/695).
Restricted calls (or restricted parts of a call) will be flagged as such in the call
conditions.
For type 1 restrictions, entities established in ineligible third countries will not be
eligible to participate.
For type 2 restrictions, the ownership control assessment will be conducted to
determine control. Furthermore, depending on the programme, Work programme or
call document, guarantees may be required if control by an (ineligible) third country,
a third country entity or a third country national is confirmed.
The present document is intended to provide guidance on how these restrictions will
be handled in practice.
Please be aware that eligibility conditions must be fulfilled not only at proposal
submission and grant signature, but throughout the entire action duration. Any
changes in the control ownership status that occur during the project must be
4EU Grants: Participation in DEP, HE and EDF restricted calls: V0.1 – 20.12.2021— DRAFT
immediately notified by the coordinator to the granting authority (please note that
this is an existing contractual information obligation in the Grant Agreement).
2. Which types of participants are targeted?
Both type 1 and type 2 restrictions in question are intended to cover entities
participating in any capacity (as beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner,
subcontractor or recipient of financial support to third parties). For EDF they also
extend to sub-subcontractors1.
The precise scope of participants will be set out in the call conditions.
The ownership control assessment check will permit to establish eligibility at the latest
before any grants are signed.
In addition, beneficiaries must ensure that other participants follow the provisions in
the Grant Agreement and call documents.
3. When will an entity be considered to be controlled?
‘Control’ will be defined as the possibility to exercise decisive influence on the
participant, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediate entities, ‘de jure’
or ‘de facto’. The fact that no influence is actually exercised is not relevant, as long as
the possibility exists.
Where type 2 restrictions apply, a participant will be considered to be ‘controlled’
when an (ineligible) third country, third country entity or third country national has
the possibility to exercise decisive influence on the entity concerned, notably in
relation to its strategic business decisions (such as appointment and removal of senior
management, budget, investment business plans, market-specific decisions, etc).
No guidance can anticipate upon all possible constellations of control of an entity,
hence, any assessment has to be done on a case-by-case basis, looking at the legal
and factual position in each individual case. As a consequence this document provides
only some general considerations for that assessment.
Control will be assessed at the level of the ultimate ownership and control line and all
intermediate layers (in case of indirect control).
The following elements will, in particular, be taken into account:
 ownership structure and specific rights;
 corporate governance;
 commercial links conferring control;
 financial links conferring control;
 other sources of control.
Public bodies (validated as such in the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant
Register) will automatically be considered as controlled by their country.
Ownership structure and specific rights
1 Sub-subcontractors to which at least 10% of the total eligible costs of the action is allocated and sub-
subcontractors which may require access to classified information in order to carry out the action.
5EU Grants: Participation in DEP, HE and EDF restricted calls: V0.1 – 20.12.2021— DRAFT
The ownership structure will be analysed to establish which countries, entities or
natural persons have decisive influence on the participant, notably with regard to the
strategic business decisions:
 if the participant is directly owned and controlled by natural persons, the
nationality of these natural persons will be the key element of assessment,
i.e.:
 if all the owners are nationals of Member States (or eligible third
country nationals) and there are no commercial or other links that could
confer control on other persons or entities, further assessment may not
be necessary,
 if some of the owners are individuals with (ineligible) third country
nationality, their ability to exercise control has to be further assessed.
 if several ownership and control layers exist between the participant and its
ultimate owners (persons who effectively control it):
 ownership and control will be identified at each layer, and at each layer
the existence of controlling ineligible country nationals/ineligible country
entities has to be assessed,
 participants will be asked to demonstrate to the extent possible that, all
along the chain of control until the ultimate owners, there is no control
by an ineligible country/ineligible country entity,
 if shareholding is widely spread, and one or several ineligible country
shareholders are the largest shareholders (even if their participating
interest may look insignificant), a detailed control assessment may
have to be conducted,
 ultimate owners with 5% (or more) of the shares/ voting rights must be
identified (upon request even shareholders with less than 5%).
 if the participant is a company listed in the stock exchange, a subsidiary of a
listed company or is controlled by a listed company, control will in principle
be assessed in the same way as described above. Where the participant has
a substantial number of shares that are floating (shares on regulated stock
markets), the emphasis will be on:
 the bodies entrusted with the adoption of strategic decisions,
 the decisions that are taken at the general meeting of shareholders and
the quorum required (participation and majority),
 the decisions that are taken in other management bodies (such as
Executive Board, Supervisory Board, Board of Directors, Advisory
Boards, CEO) and the quorum required (participation and majority),
 the appointment of management bodies and the possibilities for the
largest shareholders to appoint them,
 veto rights or multiple voting shares (e.g. golden shares), if any.
 if not all the ultimate owners can be identified (e.g. listed companies with
important floats), the participant will be asked to demonstrate that under the
applicable national law unknown shareholders cannot (alone or in concert)
6EU Grants: Participation in DEP, HE and EDF restricted calls: V0.1 – 20.12.2021— DRAFT
exercise a decisive influence, and must confirm that there is no shareholders
agreement to act in coalition.
In this context, the place of residence of owners that are natural persons will be
considered irrelevant. Individual owners with dual nationality (eligible and ineligible
country) will be considered as eligible country nationals.
Concerning specific rights, some examples of owners’ rights may deserve closer
scrutiny in terms of ‘control’:
 right to veto a transfer of shares,
 some forms of pre-emption rights (right given to an existing shareholder to
be the first option in case other shareholders want to sell their shares),
 specific rights to sell shares, purchase additional shares or conditions
imposed by the third country shareholder for its investment in the
participant,
if they lead to a situation where an (ineligible) third country, a third country entity or
a third country national control the participant.
Corporate governance
The corporate governance will be examined to establish whether strategic decisions
may be influenced, actively (through an action) or passively (by not exercising its
rights, e.g. abstention), by an (ineligible) third country, a third country entity or a
third country national.
The assessment will identify at which level (by which bodies) the strategic business
decisions are taken, the decision-making procedures (including majorities and quorum
requirements, voting rules and prerogatives accorded to other bodies, if any) and the
nature of decisions taken.
If (ineligible) third countries, third country entities or third country nationals have the
possibility to influence the voting rights (or the possibility to veto decisions), this may
lead to consider that they exercise decisive influence.
Commercial links conferring control
Commercial links will, where necessary, be analysed, in combination with other
factors, to establish whether the participant (or its owners) are dependent on
commercial cooperation with an ineligible country/ineligible country entity, in a way
that could give them strategic influence (e.g. long-term supply or buy agreements
that allow it to decide on the commercial strategy, joint venture or other commercial
cooperation).
Financial links conferring control
Financial links will be analysed to establish whether the participant (or its owners) are
financially dependent on an ineligible country/ineligible country entity, in a way that
could allow the ineligible country/ineligible country entity to obtain the power to adopt
or influence strategic decisions.
All modes of financing may be taken into account, such as capital increase, loans,
guarantees, debt waivers, bails2 and grants.
2 E.g. an investor issuing a guarantee to a bank and the bank therefore is willing to grant a loan
7EU Grants: Participation in DEP, HE and EDF restricted calls: V0.1 – 20.12.2021— DRAFT
If the financial link is with a shareholder, the degree of financial dependence will be
measured in proportion to the shareholding (i.e. how much more than the value of
the shares was financed).
Other sources of control
There might be other sources of control (i.e. other means, processes or links
ultimately conferring control to ineligible countries/ineligible country entities).
They will be assessed on the basis of the information provided in the ownership
control declaration.
4. How will control be checked? — Ownership control assessment
procedure— Guarantees
Ownership control declaration
For type 2 restricted calls, the participants that must undergo an ownership control
assessment must fill in the ownership control declaration, annexed to the application
form.
This declaration must be signed by a person empowered to represent the legal entity.
The coordinator must combine all declarations into one single document and submit it
with the proposal (signed originals should be kept on file by the participants).
Proposals missing this annex for any of their participants may be declared
inadmissible.
Public bodies are exempted from this obligation but they will automatically be
considered as controlled by their country. Formal validation in the Participant
Register is required; ‘declared’ status is not sufficient.
Assessment by the EU services
If your proposal passed evaluation, the Central Validation Service3 will then contact
you during grant preparation to upload the necessary supporting documents.
The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you
will need to provide documents showing your ownership/control situation (documents
showing all direct and indirect shareholders, statutes, articles of association,
shareholders’ agreements, reports/minutes of shareholders meetings, ID documents
of ultimate owners, etc).
Please use the link in the notification, please do NOT send us any documents
before (or via other means) and please respect the deadlines set by the Central
Validation Service.
In case of doubt, the Central Validation Service may use publicly available information
to clarify questions about the data or information provided or contact you for
clarifications or additional information.
All data and documents will be treated as confidential.
Personal data will be handled in accordance with EU Regulation 2018/17254 to ensure
3 CEF-DIG is currently not handled by the Central Validation Service
4 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions,
bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No
45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).
8EU Grants: Participation in DEP, HE and EDF restricted calls: V0.1 – 20.12.2021— DRAFT
compliance with the principles of transparency, proportionality, impartiality and
legality.
The assessment will be carried out based on the information provided in the
ownership control declaration and the supporting documents submitted later (and
updates in case of changes).
If the outcome of the ownership control assessment is ’controlled’, the consortium will
be asked to replace the participant concerned (or redistribute the tasks between the
other participants). If this is not possible and the consortium cannot propose any
other acceptable solution, the proposal will have to be rejected.
Only solutions that do not imply substantial changes to the proposal can be
accepted (solutions that — if they had been known — would have impacted the
evaluation result cannot be accepted).
Guarantees
For programmes which allow for guarantees, participation may however still be
possible even for participants that are subject to control by an ineligible
country/ineligible country entity.
In this case, participants must guarantee compliance with the specific conditions set
out in the work programme and in the call conditions, for instance:
 that the involvement will not contravene the security, defence or public order
interests of the EU and its Member States;
 that the involvement will not contravene the objectives of the funding
programme;
 that measures have been put in place to ensure that:
 the control of ineligible countries/ineligible country entities is not exercised
in a manner that:
 restrains, restricts or compromises the participant’s capacity to
carry out the action and deliver;
 imposes restrictions concerning infrastructure, facilities, assets,
resources, intellectual property or know-how needed for the action.
 access by ineligible countries/ineligible country entities to sensitive
information relating to the action is prevented (including the necessary
technical, legal and organisational measures to prevent transfer or access
— including unsolicited transfers or access — to personal or non-personal
data, including processed data and meta-data, held in the EU that would
be unlawful under EU law or applicable national law) and the employees or
other persons involved in the action have adequate security clearance,
where appropriate;
 ownership of the intellectual property arising from, and the results of, the
action:
 remain with the participant during and after the end of the action;
 are not subject to control or restriction by the ineligible
countries/ineligible country legal entities and;
9EU Grants: Participation in DEP, HE and EDF restricted calls: V0.1 – 20.12.2021— DRAFT
 are not transferred/exported outside the eligible countries;
 cannot be accessed from outside the eligible countries or by
ineligible entities without the approval of the eligible country in
which the participant is established and in accordance with the
objectives of the programme.
The requirements may differ from call to call.
The guarantees must cover all conditions and explain the concrete measures put
in place to ensure compliance.
The guarantees must be signed by the participant, they will be assessed by EC
services during grant preparation.
If ineligible country control is already known at proposal submission, you are strongly
advised to already prepare the guarantees as part of your proposal (the approval, if
needed, may be provided later during grant preparation).
In the case of EDF and DEP, if control is established by the Commission in the context
of the ownership control assessment check, you will be requested to provide the
guarantees, accompanied by a document of your country of establishment (eligible
country), which approves them, within 30 working days from receiving notification5.
For HE, if control is established by the Commission in the context of the ownership
control assessment check, you will be requested to provide the guarantees during
grant preparation, within 15 working days from receiving notification. The EC will
contact the national authorities of your country of establishment (eligible country) on
the assessment of the guarantees and seek their confirmation, which will have to be
provided within 30 working days6.
Since the guarantee procedure constitutes a derogation, the conditions will be
interpreted strictly. Guarantees/approvals which include a disclaimer will be rejected.
If the guarantees/approval is not complete or inadequate, you may be contacted for
changes or updates.
The measures set out in the guarantees must be complied with/implemented
during the action, otherwise the guarantee will be considered void and the proposal
might be declared ineligible.
New participants joining during the action
New participants, who join the project later on, will have to submit their ownership
control declaration as part of the amendment supporting documents and the same
rules as above apply mutatis mutandis.
5. What happens if the ownership control status changes during grant
implementation
Eligibility conditions must be fulfilled not only at proposal submission and grant
signature, but throughout the entire action duration.
5 For duly justified reasons, and in agreement with the EC, these time limits may be extended up to 60
working days
6 For duly justified reasons, and in agreement with the EC, these time limits may be extended up to 60
working days
10EU Grants: Participation in DEP, HE and EDF restricted calls: V0.1 – 20.12.2021— DRAFT
You are contractually obliged to notify any changes in the control/ownership status
that occur during the project. Such changes must be immediately notified by the
coordinator to the granting authority (see art 19.3 of the Grant Agreement). The
same applies to changes affecting the content of guarantees/approvals.
If a participant becomes controlled by an ineligible country/ineligible country entity
during the action (e.g. as a result of an acquisition by a foreign entity), its related
costs will become automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility and its
participation may have to be terminated.
For programmes with guarantees, the same principles apply as above. If an entity
becomes controlled during the action, it may still continue to participate if it provides
the necessary guarantees.

1. My Area — User account and roles
Getting access to My Area
The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is the central electronic portal for all EU funding and
tenders.
It is managed by the European Commission and used by itself and other EU services (together
‘EU’) for their grants, prizes and procurements.
The Portal has two parts: A public section with general information (Funding Opportunities,
Reference Documents, etc) and My Area, which is a secured, personalised section (Portal
electronic exchange system) used by the participants for managing their proposals and
grants/contracts.
For security reasons, access to My Area is based on:
• EU Login account — unique identifier for individuals. All you need to open an EU Login
account is your work e-mail address.
• Roles & access rights (Identity and Access Management System — IAM)
• PIC number — unique identifier for organisations. This 9-digit number is received after
you register in the Portal Participant Register.
In My Area you can:
• get access to non-public information on your proposals, projects/contracts,
organisations, etc
• register in the Participant Register and update your organisation/natural person data
• sign contracts, submit reports, cost claims, invoices and receive payments
• communicate with the EU services about your ongoing projects/contracts
• for experts working with the EU services: register, sign contracts, manage tasks, submit
cost claims and receive payments
• for external audit firms working with the EU services: register and manage tasks
Individual users:
• have to register as a user only once
• will be asked to agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions on their first login
• will have specific access rights, depending on their roles in the
organisation/projects/contracts
Organisations:
• will be asked to agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions when they appoint their LEAR.
1.1 EU Login
EU Login provides a single sign-on to a large number of services and tools available on the
Portal.
5EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
To access to the functions available on My Area, you must have an EU Login account.
• To create an EU Login account, you click on the Register button on the Portal homepage;
all you need is your name and work e-mail address.
• If you already have an EU Login account, you must use that one.
EU Login is the new name for the previously used ECAS account (European Commission
Authentication System); old accounts continue to work, there is no need to create new ones.
Creating an EU Login account
Go to the Portal Register page and enter:
• your first name, last name and e-mail address
• the displayed security code.
Select Create an account
You will receive an e-mail to the address that you specified, containing a link you should
use to complete the registration process.
Click the link you will be asked to choose and confirm a password.
Go back to the Portal homepage.
Click on Login and log in with your registered e-mail (user name) address and
password.
Your EU Login password and user name is personal — do NOT share it with colleagues or
anyone else. All transactions made with your account (user name, password) will be considered
as having been made by yourself. Keep your password secure and change it regularly.
Logging in to the Portal with your EU Login account
After logging in, you can use the personalised services and tools available on the Portal.
Your EU Login account gives you only general access to My Area, but it will NOT yet give you
access to project/contract data of your organisation. This access depends on your roles and
access rights.
FAQ
• FAQ on EU Login help page
1.2 Roles and access rights
Roles and access rights restrict the information a user can view and the tasks they can perform
(for instance, only a person with the coordinator role can delete a draft application).
Access rights are linked to a user's roles in the Portal personalised area (My Area), which are
in turn linked to their functions within their organisation or in relation to a particular
project/contract and their nomination by the organisation’s LEAR (or other authorised person).
6EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
How are access rights managed?
Roles are divided into 2 main sections:
• Organisation roles are linked to the whole organisation and its data (but without any
access to the projects/contracts)
• Project/contract roles are defined first in the proposal, and then transferred to the
project/contract when you have been invited to sign with the EU. They are managed
application by application and project by project, covering all types of access
(read/write/submit).
One user can have several roles at the same time.
How are the roles assigned?
Most of these roles can be freely assigned and managed by you or your organisation, according
to your needs:
• you can start creating an application yourself
• you can be invited by other users who have created an application to join their
application
• persons in your organisation can give you (and revoke) access to roles of your
organisation
• the initiator of an application (or persons in your organisation involved in an on-going
application) can give you (and revoke) access to roles in the application
• persons involved in on-going projects/contracts can give you (and revoke) access to
roles in their projects/contracts.
All access rights are linked to the user's EU Login account.
Exceptions
The EU services intervene in the assignment of the following 2 key roles:
LEAR (Legal Entity Appointed Representative) — organisation role
The LEAR is the person that is officially nominated by an organisation to manage rights and
obligations related to the use of the Portal and to act as main administrative and legal contact
in case of issues. Usually, LEARs are staff members in the central administration of the
organisation. The LEAR handles all the organisation-related data on the Portal and appoints the
persons within their organisation that are allowed to electronically sign grants/contracts and
cost claims.
There can only be one LEAR per organisation.
LEARs are validated by the Central Validation Service as part of the registration in the
Participant Register. Learn more about the detailed procedure for appointing the LEAR.
Primary Coordinator Contact — project role
The Main Contact/Contact Point of the Coordinator/Group Leader in the application will become
the PCoCo (Primary Coordinator Contact). This person is by default the one creating the
application in the Portal and thereby becomes the main person responsible for the application.
As such, they can submit requests, reports and notifications to the EU on behalf of the
consortium.
7EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
There can only be one PCoCo per project/contract.
During the application phase and before call deadline, the PCoCo may transfer this role to
someone else in the application.
Afterwards (i.e. after call submission is closed), a new PCoCo can be assigned only by the EU
Project/Procurement Officer. If such a replacement becomes necessary, the Coordinator should
send a request to the Officer via the Portal Messaging Service (My Projects/My Contracts >
Actions > Manage Project/Contract).
Exceptionally — and only until a LEAR has been appointed — self-registrants have certain
roles (that were not assigned to any of the other users listed above).
Roles — Overview
The picture below shows all the roles involved in managing organisations and projects/contracts
in the Portal.
For some funding programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe ERC and MSCA grants), additional roles
are used. See the for more details.
Organisation roles
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
The LEAR is the formally nominated main responsible for an organisation’s use of the Portal and
thus bears the final responsibilty for all the organisation’s actions in the Portal.
LEARs have system rights to:
• update their organisation's data
• nominate/revoke representatives of their organisation to electronically sign
grant/contracts
• nominate/revoke representatives of their organisation to electronically sign cost
claims/invoices
• nominate/revoke Account Administrators within their organisation to help them with
their work.
8EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The LEAR does NOT assign the Legal Signatories and Financial Signatories for a particular
project/contract. This is done by the Coordinator Contact (CoCo) or Participant Contact (PaCo)
of that project/contract.
Self-registrant
The Self-registrant is the person who first registers an organisation in the Portal Participant
Register.
Before the LEAR is validated, Self-registrants can provide the EU with requested information
and documents about their organisation.
Once the LEAR has been formally validated (normally after the organisation has been validated
by the Central Validation Service), the role of Self-registrant is revoked and replaced by the
LEAR.
Account Administrator
The LEAR may delegate tasks to one or more Account Administrators. Though the LEAR keeps
the full responsibility, Account Administrators can fulfil tasks for their LEAR. An organisation
can have an unlimited number of Account Administrators.
If the organisation nominates a new person as their LEAR, the existing Account Administrators
remain, but can be revoked by the new LEAR.
Legal Signatory (LSIGN)
LSIGNs must be nominated for an organisation by the LEAR or an Account Administrator (see
Figure 3).
LSIGNs are assigned to a particular project by a Coordinator or Participant Contact (see Figure
3). An organisation can have an unlimited number of LSIGNs.
Financial Signatory (FSIGN)
FSIGNs must be nominated for an organisation by the LEAR or an Account Administrator (see
Figure 3).
FSIGNs are assigned to a particular project by a Coordinator or Participant Contact (see Figure
3). An organisation can have an unlimited number of FSIGNs.
Primary Audit Contact (PAuCo) and Audit Contact (AuCo)
Audit roles can be assigned in the Portal only when the organisation is audited.
The LEAR is automatically assigned the Primary Audit Contact (PAuCo), and can nominate other
PAuCos in the organisation.
The PAuCo(s) must also nominate at least one Audit Contact (AuCo) as main contact for audits
on the organisation, and additionally, assign both the AuCo and the audit to an audit team
within the organisation.
PAuCos have the following system rights for their organisation:
• nominate other PAuCo(s) for the organisation and the AuCo(s) for an audit (My
Organisations > Actions > View Roles, click the Roles tab). Detailed explanations are
available in the
• manage the teams in the organisation to assign the audits and the audit contacts to
them (My Organisations > Actions > View Roles, click the Teams tab). Detailed
explanations are available in the
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• revoke other roles
AuCos can nominate other AuCos for the teams to which they are assigned. They can also
revoke other AuCos in their team.
An AuCo assigned to a team has the following system rights for those audits:
• perform the audit tasks for their organisation
• communicate with the EU auditors (receive and send formal notifications, submit audit
documents, etc)
Summary organisation roles
When nominating FSIGNs or LSIGNs, the LEAR can add comments that can help the
Participant Contacts to select the right LSIGN/FSIGN for their project (e.g. "Mr Smith can sign
for projects run by Department X from 1 February 2014."). Such comments can be useful for
defining the scope of responsibilities or duration of FSIGNs or LSIGNs in large organisations
with different departments.
Proposal roles
When preparing your proposal, you will need to define the participating organisations and the
organisation/proposal contact(s). Both are set in the application online form.
For grants and prizes: The proposal will contain the following types of participating
organisations:
• Coordinator. A proposal can have only one, and you may submit an application with just
one Coordinator and no other participating organisations. You need to name a
10EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Coordinator immediately to launch your application, but you can change it later on,
before submission.
• Partner. A proposal can have none, one or more. The number of Partners in an
application (and other aspects such as the country where they are registered, etc) are
subject to the call conditions (i.e. the specific requirements for each call for proposals).
• Partners can also have Affiliated Entities linked to them (through a permanent legal or
capital link or as members of an association; former Linked Third Parties). Affiliated
Entities are allowed to fully participate in the grant and claim costs. They must comply
with all eligibility conditions (same as a Partner).
• Associated Partners. This kind of participating organisation contributes to the project
but cannot claim costs. They are normally not linked to any Partner and do not need to
comply with the eligibility conditions.
Then, you will need to define the contact persons for each participating organisation. There are
two possible types of contacts:
• Main Contact. You need to define one per participating organisation.
• Contact Person. You may define one or more Contact Persons for each Partner. You may
further define their kind of access as Coordinator/Participant Contact (full access) or
Team Member (read-only access).
The roles in your proposal will afterwards become project roles:
• The Main Contact of the Coordinator will become the Primary Coordinator Contact
(PCoCo). This role is automatically assigned to the initiator of the application who
submits the proposal to the EU.
• The Main Contacts of the Partners will become Participant Contacts (PaCo).
• The Contact Persons of the Coordinator/Partners will become Team Members (TeMe) if
they had read-only access in the application form or Participating Contacts (PaCo) if
they had full access.
For tenders:
The tender will contain the following types of participating organisations:
• Group Leader. A submission can have only one, and you may submit a tender with just
one Group Leader and no more participating organisations.
• Group Member. A submission can have none, one or more (often none).
In a call for tenders, you need to provide one single contact: Contact Point. One per application.
This Contact is always linked to the Group Leader.
During the submission phase, this is the only role which will be defined. The Contact Point will
then become the Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo).
Project/contract roles
Depending on your project roles you can have read-only, read-write or read-write-submit rights
to information, documents and online forms.
(Primary) Coordinator Contact (PCoCo/CoCo)
The Primary Coordinator Contact is for each project the main contact between the consortium
and the EU for a particular project/contract. By default, it is the person that creates the
application in the Portal.
11EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The PCoCo can nominate/revoke a Coordinator Contact (CoCo) for the project/contract
(unlimited number possible), who will then have the same rights — except the right to revoke
the PCoCo.
All Coordinator Contacts can:
• nominate/revoke Participant Contacts for other organisations in the consortium
• nominate/revoke Task Managers and Team Members in their own organisation
• assign Legal and Financial Signatories in their organisation to their projects
• make changes to project documents on the Portal
• communicate with the EU services and submit applications and project documents to
the EU.
It is important to list your partner organisations (and their contact persons) relatively early
on in the application process, because this will give them access to the application and allow
them to appoint other roles for their organisation.
Participant Contact (PaCo)
The PaCo is a representative of an organisation in the consortium that is not the coordinating
organisation.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of PaCos per project, and each will be able to:
• nominate/revoke other PaCos in their organisation
• assign Legal and Financial Signatories in their organisation to their projects/contracts
• submit their work to the Coordinator
• nominate/revoke Task Managers and Team Members in their own organisation
• make changes specifically to the participant-related sections of the project documents
on the Portal
• submit information directly to the EU services (if required under the Grant Agreement)
Task Manager (TaMa)
TaMas can perform some restricted actions: creating, updating and uploading documents about
their organisation's participation and completing, modifying or deleting project/contract
information.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of TaMas per project. They cannot nominate or
revoke anybody, nor submit information to the Coordinator or EU.
This role is not used during the application phase.
Team Member (TeMe)
TeMes have limited access rights: search and read-only functions.
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN)
The PLSIGN has the right to sign the grant/contract (and amendments) for a specific project on
behalf of the organisation.
12EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint LSIGNs; the Coordinator and each
participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PLSIGNs for a given project to act as legal
signatory for the participant in the project.
An organisation can have can have an unlimited number PLSIGNs per project.
They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot
assign/revoke any roles.
Project Financial Signatory (PFSIGN)
The PFSIGN has the right to sign cost claims/invoices on behalf of the organisation.
The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint FSIGNs; the Coordinator and each
participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PFSIGNs for a given project to act as legal
signatory for the participant in the project.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of PFSIGNs per project.
They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot
assign/revoke any roles.
Summary project/contract roles
Rights associated with roles
13EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Nomination process
Some roles are automatically given based on the information in your application:
• The proposal initiator will become the Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo).
• The main contact persons in the participating organisations will become Participant
Contacts (PaCos).
• Persons with read-only access to the proposal will become Team Members (TeMes).
Once your organisation is validated by the Central Validation Service, it is important that
you appoint a LEAR to make sure that you can manage the access rights to the Portal.
How to nominate/revoke someone
To grant a role, the LEAR (or other authorised person) must enter the user's e-mail address. It
must be the same as the address the person used to open their EU Login account.
If the person does not already have an EU Login account, they will automatically receive an
invitation to create one.
Organisation roles — to grant/revoke, go to My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation
Roles > Add Roles.
Project/contract roles — to grant/revoke, go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Consortium
> Edit Roles.
How many different roles are needed in a consortium?
A user's EU Login account can carry any combination of roles, this depends on the participants.
Thus, a user can acquire a differentiated set of access rights to different functions for managing
projects, contracts or organisation data.
For small organisations or beneficiaries who are individuals (natural persons), this means
that one single person can combine all the access rights needed to manage their
projects/contracts (i.e. LEAR, CoCo/PaCo, PLSIGN and PFSIGN).
The minimum configuration for a consortium in any given project is:
• 1 Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo)
14EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• 1 Participant Contact (PaCo) per beneficiary
• 1 LEAR per organisation
• 1 Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN) per organisation
• 1 Project Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) per organisation.
One person can have several roles at the same time.
Organisations that participate as Affiliated Entities (or other type of participant — Associated
Partner, Subcontractor, etc) do NOT need any access roles in the Portal, since they are not
allowed to use it. All actions in the Portal are handled for them by the Coordinator/Beneficiary
they are linked to.

1.3 Accepting the Terms and Conditions of Use
The Portal is part of the Single Electronic Data Exchange Area set up under Articles 147 and
128 of the EU Financial Regulation.
On the first login to My Area, users must agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions and the
Portal Privacy Statement.
Organisations will be asked to agree to the Terms and Conditions when they appoint their LEAR
(declaration of consent). Every time you access to My Area, you are implicitly reaffirming
your acceptance of the Terms and Conditions valid at that time.
Personal data will be kept and processed for the purposes of the Single Electronic Data Exchange
Area, i.e. for the management and implementation of your EU grants, contracts, prizes and
other transactions managed through the Portal. The detailed conditions for the processing of
your personal data are set out in the Portal Privacy Statement.
2. Participant Register — Register your organisation
15EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If you want to submit a proposal, your organisation needs to be registered in the Portal
Participant Register and have a 9-digit Participant Identification Code (PIC).
If your proposal is successful, you will receive a notification and be asked to:
• provide supporting documents to confirm the administrative and legal information
declared during the registration (legal entity validation)
• appoint a Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR appointment)
• provide supporting documents to verify the financial capacity of your organisation
(financial capacity assessment, if applicable)
• validate the bank account for payments (bank account validation, only for coordinators).
2.1 Registration and validation of your organisation
Before submitting an application, all participants involved in the proposal must first be
registered in the Portal Participant Register and have their 9-digit Participant Identification Code
(PIC number).
You can verify directly on the Portal whether your organisation is already registered and has a
PIC. If not, please proceed with the registration following the instructions on the same page
(the Registration wizard will help you through the process). Once completed, you get the PIC
to be used in your online application form and further correspondence with the EU services.
If you do not have an user account (EU Login), you will first need to create one, before starting
the registration process. If you already have a user account (EU Login), you can log in and
directly start registration.
Please note that the Participant Register is primarily directed at organisations and that not
all of the labels fit for individuals (natural persons). Enter your information as appropriate (e.g.
country of residence instead of country of registration, passport number instead of registration
number, etc).
What you need to register your organisation
To register your organisation, you will need to provide basic administrative and legal
information, in addition to contact details.
Get ready
Since the declared information will be verified against supporting documents later on, it is
useful to have the relevant documents at hand when you complete the registration, to
make sure you fill in everything correctly (legal form, non-profit, public/private, etc).
16EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Check for already existing PIC
In order to avoid creating duplicate PICs, you should first check whether your organisation
(or another department) is already registered in the Portal and use that PIC.
Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Search a PIC > Search a PIC and put in
your organisation data. Check several variants to make sure there is really no entry.
If no PIC is registered, start registration
Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Register your organisation. The
Registration wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process.
Detailed explanations are available in the .
You do not need to complete the registration process in a single session. You can enter some
information, save it and continue later on. To resume your registration, go to My Organisations
> Continue Registration. Incomplete draft registrations are automatically deleted after one
year.
If you create by mistake a new PIC, see below Data updates.
PIC number
After completing a new registration, you will receive the 9-digit Participant Identification
Code (PIC) — to be used in your online application form and further correspondence with the
EU services.
The newly created PIC will be provisional (declared/non-valid status) until it is formally validated
at a later stage.
Nothing else is expected from you after the PIC has been generated, the Central Validation
Service will contact you later, to initiate the validation process.
Validation of your organisation
If your proposal is successful, you will be contacted for the validation of your PIC
registration data.
Validation is needed only for certain types of participants (grants: Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities; procurement: Contractors). It is not needed for Associated Partners, Subcontractors
or other participants.
It will be done by the Central Validation Service which carries out the validation for all EU
services using the Portal.
The Central Validation Service will contact the person who registered the organisation (Self-
registrant) and ask them to:
• upload official supporting documents (via the My Organisations page)
• clarify any details.
The documents that are required will be listed in the notification you receive. You will need to
fill out a legal entity identification form and provide us with an official VAT document,
registration extract, statutes or act of establishment, etc. The detailed list of documents is also
17EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
explained in the Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity
Assessment.
The Central Validation Service will check that your organisation is legally recognised (has legal
personality). If this is not the case (exceptionally this is allowed), you will have to prove that
the representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on the organisation’s behalf
and that the organisation has financial and operational capacity equivalent to that of legal
persons.
The Central Validation Service will also check whether your organisation qualifies for some of
the special legal statuses that are required for some funding programmes (private or public
body, non-profit, international organisation).
The outcome of this process is the validation of your organisation (validated PIC). The Central
Validation Service will send a confirmation message once the process is completed and the PIC
is validated.
Please don’t forget that all communications with the Central Validation Service must take
place through the Participant Register (My Organisations page). Emails and other
communications will NOT be accepted.
Please also note that if you apply for a call with specific eligibility criteria that are not validated
by the Central Validation Service, these will be checked by the responsible EU service managing
the call — in addition to the validation, which means that they may come back to you with
additional questions.
Validation of the organisation is a prerequisite for the LEAR appointment.
Data updates
Updates to the registered organisation data must be requested via the Participant Register (My
Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation):
• by the LEAR (or Account Administrators) for validated entities
• by the Self-registrant if your organisation has not been validated yet.
If your organisation has already a validated PIC and a new one is created by mistake, your
LEAR or Account Administrator should contact the Central Validation Service via the Portal
Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation). The information will be
transferred from the duplicate PIC to the correct PIC and the duplicate flagged.
SME self-assessment
In addition to the standard validation, a SME self-assessment is needed if you apply for a call
where SME status is an eligibility criterion (or allows for a higher funding rate or other
advantages).
If there is no recent (not older than 2 years) SME self-assessment information available in the
Participant Register, the Portal Submission System will automatically prompt you to go through
the SME self-assessment wizard to establish your SME status. You will need to enter the
financial figures of the last approved accounting period of your organisation and of any other
organisation that might be directly or indirectly related to you. If the result confirms your SME
status, you will be able to proceed with the application process.
Please note that the SME self-assessment is only needed if the SME-status is an eligibility
criterion (or gives special advantages); otherwise, you will simply self-declare your SME status
in the Legal Information tab and proceed with the registration.Detailed rules are explained in
the Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment.

2.2 LEAR appointment and validation
Parallel to the validation of your organisation, you will be requested by the Central Validation
Service to appoint your Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR).
This must be done by a legal representative of your organisation with the necessary legal
authority to commit the organisation for this type of decisions (e.g. typically CEOs, rectors,
Director-Generals, etc... always in accordance with the statutes of your organisation). If
such decisions are normally reserved for joint decision-making by several representatives, the
appointment must be done together (documents signed by all).
The LEAR role, which can be performed by any member of the organisation (typically from the
central administration), is key. They are formally nominated to manage your organisation’s use
of the Portal and thus bear the final responsibilty for all your actions in the Portal. Once
validated, they will be responsible for:
• keeping an overview of all the proposals/projects/contracts your organisation is involved
in
• managing all the legal and financial information about your organisation
• managing the access rights at organisation-level (and read-only access at project-level)
• appointing the persons which will be able to electronically sign grants/contracts (Legal
Signatories — LSIGNs) and cost claims/invoices (Financial Signatories — FSIGNs).
Applicants that are natural persons do not need to prove their capacity to become a LEAR, but
still need to enter their LEAR data and submit supporting documents.
Further details about the LEAR's rights and responsibilities are explained in the Roles and access
rights section.
Appointing and validation of your LEAR
Please note that registration and validation of your organisation is a prerequisite for the
validation of your LEAR.
Identify the person in your organisation who will act as LEAR and the legal
representative who will appoint them
The person who initially registered the organisation in the Participant Register (the Self-
registrant) will receive the notification from the Central Validation Service to launch the
LEAR appointment procedure.
Encode in the Participant Register the name and contact information of the
LEAR and the legal representative appointing them
19EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
To do so, the Self-registrant must go to My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation.
The Participant Register will, then, generate the necessary documents to be signed:
• LEAR appointment letter and LEAR role and duties (generated as a single document)
• declaration of consent to the Portal Terms & Conditions.
The system will automatically check the existence of an EU Login account for the LEAR (e-
mail address, first and last name). In case of inconsistencies, the system alerts the Self-
registrant. If no EU Login account exists, the system will start creating one and the LEAR
will be requested (via a notification e-mail) to finalise it. The LEAR appointment process
will be blocked until this is done.
Get your organisation's legal representative to:
• date, sign and stamp the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR roles and duties
document generated by the system ( both sections must be signed)
• read the Portal Terms and Conditions and
• date, sign and stamp the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions.
Upload the following documents in the Participant Register:
• the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR role and duties (dated and signed by the legal
representative and the LEAR)
• the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions (dated and signed by
the legal representative)
• copies of an official valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport) with a photo and
signature of:
the legal representative and
o
the appointed LEAR
o
• documents proving the authority of the legal representative; these documents
must:
clearly indicate the person’s role/function within the organisation as legal
o
representative
identify and appoint the individual (by name) as the person covering that
o
specific role/function.
Don't forget that you MUST keep the originals of all documents you uploaded, so that
they are available in case of EU controls, checks or audits. Since your registration in the
Participant Register is valid for this and any future EU funding and tenders procedures your
organisation will ever apply for, the originals must be kept permanently, as long as you are
registered in the Portal (and possibly beyond, for controls, checks and audits, etc). You
should therefore NOT throw them away and ensure that they are maintained also in case
of insolvency, takeover or change of control.
Validation of the LEAR appointment by the Central Validation Service
20EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
After receiving the above-listed documents and once the corresponding PIC has been
validated, the Central Validation Service will also validate the LEAR appointment in the
Participant Register.
Activate the LEAR's online user account
After validation, the LEAR account (with the special access rights) can be be activated by:
• following the instructions the LEAR receives by e-mail
• using the account activation PIN code which will be sent to the LEAR by post, or
by SMS if the LEAR's mobile phone number was provided
Should you encounter any problems with the LEAR appointment, please contact the Central
Validation Service via the Portal Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions> Modify
Organisation).
Data updates — Changing the LEAR
If you need to replace an already validated LEAR, you can designate a new LEAR by making a
new appointment (same steps as initial appointment).
If you are a LEAR and your e-mail address has changed, please inform the Central Validation
Service via the Portal Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation),
in order to obtain instructions on how to proceed for the change.
How can you contact the LEAR?
For contacting LEARs of other organisations, go to How to participate > Participant Register >
Search a PIC to find the organisation. Then, select Actions > Contact Organisation. This will
launch a contact form that allows you to send a message to the LEAR (and their Account
Administrators). The LEAR can then contact you directly.
To contact your own LEAR, log in and then go to My Organisations > Actions > Contact
Organisation.

2.3 Bank account registration and validation
Registration and validation of the bank account for payments
In addition to the validation of the participating organisations, we also have to validate the bank
account that will be used for our payments to you (usually bank account of the Coordinator).
The Central Validation Service will contact the Coordinator after the PIC is validated, to enter
the bank account details into the Participant Register and upload the necessary supporting
documents (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you will need
to provide the bank account details and either a bank statement or financial identification form.
21EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The Central Validation Service will cross-check this information and validate the account.When
registering your organisation for the first time, you do not need to declare any bank account
information. You will be prompted to do this only later on, if your proposal is successful.
Data updates
If you need to change an already validated bank account, please declare the new bank account
details via the Participant Register and upload the required supporting documents.
Please note that it can happen that not all types of modifications are supported. In case of an
issue, please contact the IT Helpdesk.
2.4 Financial capacity assessment
Assessment of your financial capacity
For some participants, we will also have to check the financial capacity before awarding
grants/contracts.
For grants, the criteria for checking financial capacity are set out in the call conditions.
Normally, the financial capacity assessment will be done for all Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities, except:
− public bodies (entities established as public body under national law, including local,
regional or national authorities) or international organisations
− if the individual requested grant amount is EUR 60 000 or below.
Specific rules apply for some programmes (i.e. only for coordinators; only for grants above a
certain threshold; State guarantee; see Horizon Europe Programme Guide, Erasmus+
Programme Guide).
The Central Validation Service will contact you during grant preparation to upload the necessary
financial documents (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you will need
to provide documents showing your financial situation for the last two closed financial years
(profit and loss account and balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an approved
external auditor, certifying the accounts for the last closed financial year, etc).
The analysis is based on neutral financial indicators (liquidity, financial autonomy, solvency and
profitability), but will also take into account other aspects, such as dependency on EU funding
and deficit and revenue in previous years. The results of your financial capacity assessment will
be taken into account when evaluating your ability to implement the project (and to take on
the Coordinator role, if it is the case).
If we consider that your financial capacity is not satisfactory, we may require:
– an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several liabiliy for all
Beneficiaries or joint and several liability of Affiliated Entities
– prefinancing paid in instalments (multiple/additional prefinancing)
– (one or more) prefinancing guarantees
or
– propose no prefinancing or
– request that you are replaced or, if needed, reject the entire application.
22EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Specific rules apply to programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM, former Participant
Guarantee Fund; e.g. Horizon Europe). For these programmes, prefinancing guarantees and
joint and several liability of Beneficiaries are normally excluded.
Financial capacity self-check
You can check your financial capacity yourself by using the Financial capacity self-check
simulator.
The self-check is not available for all programmes (because of the algorithms used).
Moreover, it is only a simulation. If a formal financial capacity assessment is required, you will
have to go through the formal procedure.

• Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment
2.5 Data updates
Who can update the online information about your organisation?
• Initially, only the person who first registered the organisation or any other appointed
Self-registrant
• once appointed, only the appointed representative (LEAR) and appointed Account
Administrators.
To change the information on your organisation, go to My Organisations > Actions > Modify
Organisation.
Please upload legal/financial supporting documents for any updates you submit so that the
Central Validation Service can validate them. Maximum size for uploads: 6MB per file
Changes of legal status
If your organisation changes status or address, your LEAR should immediately update the
information in the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation) and,
if possible, directly inform (via your Coordinator) your EU Project Officers in ongoing grants
(Coordinator uses the Portal Messaging Facility: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Process communications > New message).
Some changes like, for instance, partial or universal transfers of rights will moreover require
amendments in case you have ongoing Grant Agreements/Procurement Contracts.
Managing roles in the organisation
If organisation roles need to be changed, your LEAR should immediately update them in the
system (My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation Roles)
If project/contract roles need to be changed, your CoCo/PaCo should immediately update them
in the system (My Projects > Actions > Project Consortium).
If grants/contracts or cost claims/invoices are signed in the system by persons whose access
rights should have been revoked, this will be your responsibility and you will have to bear the
consequences. Their signatures and other actions will be considered valid by the EU services.

2.6 Complaints about validation
If you believe that a validation result is flawed, you can submit a complaint (following the
deadline and procedure set out in the message on the validation result).
Generally, the means of redress are the following:
• request for validation review — within 30 days of receiving the message
• request for review of legality under Article 22 of Regulation 58/2003 — within 1 month
of receiving the message (using the Article 22 complaints form template)
• action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU — within 2 months of receiving the
message.
You are free to choose any of the above means of redress. However, in the interest of good
administration and procedural efficiency, it is recommended to use first the available
administrative review procedures (if any). The objective of these procedures is to re-examine
the circumstances of the validation procedure and to reach a final decision on your registration.
Deadlines for further redress will therefore run as from when you receive our reply with the
final position.
Please note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending are
considered to have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from opening/access (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
When filing a complaint, please take into account that the formal decision was taken by the
Central Validation Service hosted in the REA executive agency, and that complaints must
therefore be directed against that agency (NOT against the European Commission).
In case you consider that there has been maladministration on the part of the Central Validation
Service, you can also address a complaint to the European Ombudsman — within 2 years after
you became aware of it AND after having used all the means of administrative redress available
(validation review and Article 22 request).

You can access calls and topics in your area of interest through the Portal Search funding &
tenders page. This page allows you to search in the text of the call and topic titles, call and
topic identifiers, topic description and keywords and tags. You can also filter using the quick
search per topics related to specific EU priorities.
If you would like to receive updates on new calls, you can subscribe to the Funding Opportunities
RSS feed.
The Search funding & tenders page also hosts calls for tenders (EU procurements) and prizes.
It does NOT cover financial instruments (EU loans and venture capital) — these are normally
managed through financial partners (banks), but the Portal homepage has a direct link to the
Access to finance page on Europa.
Calls and topics
On the Portal most calls are divided into topics.
Call — Group of topics that are open in parallel and address the same policy domain.
Topic — Part of a call with one opening and closing date. The proposals submitted to the topic
will be evaluated together and compete against each other.
The Search funding & tenders page will display the list of open topics; the name of the call they
belong to is visible on the Topic page.
The Topic page contains all the information you need to have for your proposal (call conditions,
legal framework and key documents, standard application form and other practical information
you need to prepare your proposal). The Topic page also specifies the call deadline and contains
a link to the Portal Submission System, through which you can submit your proposal. The
Topic page also contains call and topic updates (changes or important information for the
applicants).
Deadline for submission
A topic is considered open until the deadline for submission has passed (call deadline).
Each topic will specify deadlines and/or cut-off dates.
Deadline models
Single-stage
For most topics, you must submit a full proposal by the call deadline.
Two-stage
26EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Some topics have a 2-stage submission procedure, which means that you have to submit a
short outline proposal for stage 1 and then a full proposal only if you are invited to stage 2
(meaning that your project looks promising).
Multiple cut-off
Some topics are continuously open, where you can submit a proposal at any time, and cut-
off dates mean that all proposals received by a given cut-off date will be evaluated after that
deadline.
Types of action
Types of action designate funding schemes, i.e. calls with the same characteristics: policy
domain (scope of funded activities), award criteria, reimbursement rate and in some cases form
of funding (budget-based grant, lump sum grant, unit grant, prize, procurement, debt and
equity facility, etc).
The types of action depend on each EU programme.
There are two main types: action grants (for projects) and operating grants (to support
organisations and their running costs).
In addition, most programmes distinguish the following:
• Project Grants
• Lump Sum Grants
• Unit Grants and
• Framework Partnerships.
However, especially larger programmes have developed their own specific set of types of action,
for instance:
• Horizon Europe: Research and Innovation Actions, Innovation Actions, Coordination and
Support Actions, Pre-commercial Procurements, Public Procurement of Innovative
Solutions, etc
• Digital Europe: Simple Grants, Coordination and Support Actions, SME Support Actions,
Grants for Financial Support, Grants for Procurement, PAC Grants for Procurement,
Lump Sum Grants, Framework Partnerships
• CEF: Project Grants, Infrastructure Projects, Lump Sum Grants, Unit Grants, Framework
Partnerships
• Single Market Programme: Project Grants, Lump Sum Grants, Grants for Financial
Support, PPI Grants for Procurement, Framework Partnerships, European Statistics, etc.
Within the types of actions, EU grants fund all kinds of activities (collaborative actions,
coordination and networking actions, coordination and support actions, support to
organisations, technical assistance and capacity building actions, mobility actions, cofund
actions to existing grant schemes/procurements of the beneficiaries, infrastructure actions,
etc).
Technology readiness levels (TRL)
Calls in the field of innovation (close to market) often use the notion of technology readiness
level to specify also the level of technology readiness that is expected from the projects. There
are 9 technology readiness levels:
27EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• TRL 1 — basic principles observed
• TRL 2 — technology concept formulated
• TRL 3 — experimental proof of concept
• TRL 4 — technology validated in lab
• TRL 5 — technology validated in relevant environment
• TRL 6 — technology demonstrated in relevant environment
• TRL 7 — system prototype demonstration in operational environment
• TRL 8 — system complete and qualified
• TRL 9 — actual system proven in operational environment.
3.1.2 Projects that can be funded — Conditions for funding
The types of projects and activities that can be funded are set out for each call in the call
conditions on the Topic page.
The other conditions (eligibility of participants, admissibility requirements, exclusion grounds,
operational and financial capacity requirements, award criteria, etc) are also explained on the
Topic page.
Please note that for some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe, EDF and AMIF), projects may
need to undergo additional checks and procedures before funding can be awarded, such as
specific ethics review, security scrutiny, third country control check, etc.
3.1.3 Apply with partners or as individual
Who can apply?
To see whether your organisation is eligible for funding, check the call conditions on the Topic
page.
In general, most EU funding programmes require that participants (Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities) are:
• legal entities (public or private bodies, including international organisations)
and
• established in one of the eligible countries, i.e.:
EU Member State (including EU overseas countries and territories (OCTs))
o
eligible non-EU countries:
o
EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway — if opted-in for the
o
programme)
associated countries (countries associated to the funding programme by
o
paying a contribution — list differs for each programme).
Please be aware, however, that almost all programmes have additional criteria, which
widen or narrow the group of entities that can apply. Some programmes are open to participants
from the entire world (e.g. Horizon Europe) others are deliberately restricted to EU countries
only (e.g. EDF). In addition, the situation can be different from call to call even within a
programme. It is therefore very important to carefully look at the call conditions.
Moreover, participants must be registered in the Participant Register (mandatory for
Beneficiaries, Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners) and be validated by the Central
28EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Validation Service by the time the grant is signed (mandatory for Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities).
Multi-participant or mono-participant actions
Most of the calls for EU grants target multi-beneficiary consortia made up of participants from
different countries — to enhance the EU added value, promote cooperation between
organisations in different countries, reinforce the quality of applications and ensure fair
competition and equal opportunities throughout the EU.
Some programmes formalise this, by adding specific requirements for the consortium
composition (e.g. Horizon Europe, UCPM, etc).
To see whether a call requires minimum consortium composition, check the call conditions on
the Topic page.
How to find partners for your project ideas?
To find partners for your project ideas, you can:
• Use the Partner Search function of the Portal. The function allows to:
look for organisations which received funding in the past
o
create and check Partner Search requests by call/topic
o
• Use other Partner Search tools and services. A list of recommended support sites is
offered under the Helpdesks & Support Services page.
• Participate in conferences, brokerage events organised by the EU or networks in the
Member States (National Contact Points or Desks, Enterprise Europe Network, etc).
Portal Partner Search
If you want to find experienced partners who already have ongoing projects, or if you want to
browse in the database of registered organisations, visit the Partner Search page. You can
search by keyword/geographical area/funding type, etc. Search results include complete
organisation profiles with lists of funded projects and the possibility to contact representatives.
If you have selected your area of interest via the Topic search, you may publish your
offer/interest for one or more of the open/forthcoming topics of a call on the Portal. All your
published offers/interests will be visible on your organisation's page too.
Enterprise Europe Network Cooperation Opportunities Database — The Enterprise Europe
Network (EEN) publishes an extensive number of innovation and technology profiles from
international companies and research organisations to help identify suitable partners for
bilateral business, innovation and technology cooperation. The EEN database is updated with
new profiles on a weekly basis. All profiles are published anonymously. Express your interest in
collaboration by filling in and sending the Expression of Interest form to your local EEN office,
who will establish the contact.
Consortium roles and responsibilities
When setting up your grant consortium, you should think of organisations that help you reach
objectives and solve problems.
29EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Beneficiaries — Affiliated Entities — Associated Partners —
Subcontractors
The roles should be attributed according to the level of participation in the project. Main
participants should participate as Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities (former Linked Third
Parties); other entities can participate as Associated Partners, Subcontractors, Third parties
giving in-kind contributions, etc.
Associated Partners and Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not get any part
of the grant money and will therefore have to organise other funding sources (bear their own
costs, internal reallocation of funding inside the consortium, find investors, etc).
Subcontracting should normally constitute a limited part of the project and will need to
be justified (give reasons). Tasks may NOT be subcontracted inside the consortium (between
Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities).
Coordinator — Other Beneficiaries
The Coordinator is responsible for managing the project, submitting reports and deliverables
and acting as intermediary for all contacts with the EU Granting Authority.
The other Beneficiaries must implement their part of the project and contribute to the grant
administration (preparing the grant, reporting, etc).
The consortium participants will be jointly responsible for implementing the project activities
(in accordance with their proposal/description of the action). If a project is not finished (or badly
implemented), the grant money may have to be reduced for everyone.
3.1.4 Submit a proposal — Portal Submission System
Proposal submission
Proposals must be submitted electronically using the Portal Submission System.
Where? Access to the Submission System is available through the Topic page on the Portal>
Start Submission.
Who? Proposals must be created and submitted by a contact person of the coordinating
organisation. Exceptions exist for some programmes/types of action which are fully focused on
individuals (e.g. the Principal Investigator in Horizon Europe ERC grants or the Fellow in Horizon
Europe MSCA grants).
How? The Submission wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process. You will need
to use the online forms and templates available in the Submission System. The application form
is described below.
Submission process
Get prepared: Finding your topic > Find partners > Plan your work and budget
Electronic proposal submission: Get an EU Login account > Get a PIC number (Participant
Register) > Launch Submission wizard > Pre-register your draft proposal > List participants,
contact persons > Fill in Administrative Forms (Part A) > Upload Technical Description (Part B)
> Submit your proposal > Acknowledgement of receipt
Application form (Part A and B)
30EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Proposals are submitted using the application forms available in the Submission System. The
application form is structured in into two parts, Parts A and B:
• Part A: contains the structured Administrative Forms with data on the participants, legal
declarations and contact persons (retrieved from the Submission System screens). It
may also include some programme-specific questions.
• Part B (the narrative part): Technical Description of the project with the planned
activities, work packages, costs, etc (must be uploaded as PDF).
Part A is generated while entering the data into the Submission System; Part B needs to be
prepared in advance (using the template downloaded from the system; do NOT use the standard
template from the Topic page).
Part B will also include annexes and supporting documents if required by the call conditions
(detailed budget table, declarations from national authorities, CVs, annual activity reports, etc).
All participants can contribute to the parts, but it is the person from the coordinating
organisation who created the application who must finalise and submit the application.
For programmes with specific security requirements, special instructions may apply (e.g. for
EDF, documents must be uploaded through a password-word protected zip file). For such
programmes, detailed instructions will be available in the call documentation.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Mandate: Make sure that you have the mandate of all participants to submit the
application (explicit agreement to participate).
• Quality check:
Check that the application is coherent and that Part A and B are consistent (especially
budgetary information).
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed; make
sure that no annexes are missing.
Confidentiality
EU services will treat your proposal confidentially, as well as any related information, data
and documents received.
Our evaluators (both in-house and outside experts, if any) are also bound by an obligation of
confidentiality.
Please do NOT discuss your proposal with persons that might act as expert evaluator for us
or be otherwise involved in the evaluation, since this could lead to a conflict of interest with
adverse consequences both for you and the concerned person.
Security, data protection and document retention
Your proposal and all the information received from you will be stored under secure conditions
at all times. The Portal is a closed, secured platform with multiple safeguards.
After the evaluation, we will keep the proposals for audit trail purposes (at least 5 years for
unsuccessful proposals and 10 years after project end for successful proposals and, possibly,
longer if needed for controls, checks and audit purposes).
Personal data will be handled according to the standards set out in Regulation No 2018/1725
and in line with the Portal Privacy Statement.
31EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please be aware that your proposal MUST NOT contain any classified information (Decision
2015/444 or national rules).
Access to proposals
The proposals will remain sealed and closed until after the call deadline.
However, in order to plan the evaluation process (organise translations, evaluation capacities,
evaluators with specialist knowledge, etc) we will ask you for permission to access to certain
information already before:
• call title and topic for which the proposal is submitted
• title of your application, proposal abstract, keywords
• PICs of the participating organisations
• relevant panel (for proposals submitted to specific panels, e.g. Horizon Europe MSCA,
UCPM).
A warning will inform you that the Granting Authority will be accessing this information and
will give you the opportunity to refuse access.

3.1.4.1 Get prepared
Before you can start completing your application, you should study the call documentation,
select partners and plan your project.
Study the call documentation
Choose your topic, and then read carefully the related documents and standard
templates that are available on the Topic page.
The Submission System will check some basic admissibility and eligibility requirements,
but NOT all of them. It is therefore very important that you carefully read the call
conditions. Please note that whenever there is a contradiction between the IT checks in
place and the call documentation, the call documentation prevails.
Select your partners for the project
Most calls require several participants in the proposal (see call conditions on the Topic
page).
You can use the Portal Partner Search to find partners. Other partner search tools are
explained in the Helpdesk & Support Services page.
Plan your project and prepare the Technical Description (Part B)
Planning of the work (work packages, deliverables, milestones)
32EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Look at the call conditions, award criteria and standard application form (Technical
Description (Part B)) on the Topic page.
For most types of action the Technical Description must give a detailed description of the
project idea and work plan (work packages, milestones and deliverables, division of
responsibilities and resources, time schedule, project management structure,
dissemination and communication activities).
Work packages
All project activities should be grouped in a logical, consistent and structured way into
separate work packages. All work packages must present a clear, logical link to the
project objectives and to the other work packages. Ideally, each work package should
constitute a sub-part of the project, a step leading to the achievement of the project’s
overall goals.
Projects should normally have at least 2 work packages:
− work package 1 — management and coordination activities
− work package 2 — outputs related to the project goals.
Beyond that, create only as many as you need (as many as necessary, as few as
possible).
Work package 1 should normally cover all activities related to the general management
and coordination of the project and any activities that do not relate to any of the work
packages leading to a specific result, but which are directly linked to the project as a whole.
For the other work packages, describe the:
• objective(s)
• activities to be implemented — in specific terms
• (tangible and intangible) outputs to be produced.
Milestones & deliverables (if required)
Concerning the outputs:
1. Distinguish between milestones and deliverables:
− milestones: control points in the project that help to chart progress (kick-
off meetings, steering committes, first-draft of a survey, prototype, etc)
− deliverables: outputs to be submitted to the EU (publication, leaflet,
progress report, brochure, list, etc)
2. Be as specific as possible, e.g.:
− events — the number of events, title, content, duration, number of
participants, etc.
− publications — number of pages, language, format (printed/electronic),
number of printed copies (in each language), etc.
3. Be realistic about what you can achieve within the project duration. The scope of
your project should be large enough to make a difference, but it doesn't need to produce
an excessively high number of outputs.
4. Refer only to major outputs. Do NOT include minor sub-items, internal working
papers, meeting minutes, etc. Adapt the number of deliverables to the size of your
33EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
project and work packages (use as many as necessary, as few as possible). You may
be asked to reduce or increase the number during grant preparation.
Budget
Look at the budget table in the Administrative Forms (Part A) in the Submission System.
Only the white cells need to be filled in (the grey cells are not applicable or automatically
filled by the system).
Cross-check with Part B to see if you will also need to submit a detailed budget table or
outline budgetary details also in Part B.
The budget categories to be used for the call are set out in the call conditions and explained
in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
The budgeted costs should be based on a detailed and accurate estimation of your
estimated project costs (based on the cost eligibility rules set out in the Grant Agreement).
They should include all your estimated costs (those of your Affiliated Entities should be
presented separately, for each participating entity).
Keep your estimates on file — you may be required to produce them later on.
Annexes & supporting documents
If required by the call conditions, you will need to prepare additional annexes and
supporting documents (consortium description, declarations by the national authorities,
CVs, annual activity reports, etc).
Use the templates provided inside the Submission System (NOT the ones on the Topic
page).
Detailed budget table (if required)
Many programmes require the submission of a detailed budget table (templates are usually
in format .xlsx or .xlxm).
Simple .xlsx files can simply be filled-in, merged and uploaded. For .xlsm files, you can
usually — after the table has been filled-in and completed using the macro-support — save
a copy as .xlsx and use that copy for merging and uploading the file.
If you are asked to merge and upload a table as PDF (usually for needed for GAP), please
proceed as follows:
Sheets per participant must be filled in for each Beneficiary/Affiliated Entity; sheets for
the entire project must be filled in by the Coordinator — after having received all the
information by the other participants.
Combine into a single PDF:
1. Save participant sheets into one PDF per Beneficiary/Affiliated Entity (choose
sheets via ‘Options’ when saving as PDF)
2. Save participant sheets and project sheets into a PDF for the Coordinator.
3. Combine into a single PDF for upload (using Adobe Acrobat or the Preview App
on Apple Macs).
4. Upload in the system.
CVs (if required)
Provide CVs for the core project team (these are the key staff you have listed in part B and
may include outside experts, if key to your proposal).
34EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
You can submit CVs in any format. If standard CVs are required in the call conditions we
strongly recommend you to use the Europass format. If short outlines are requested, there
are no specific formatting requirements (but please keep the information on each person
to name, birthdate and 1-2 paragraphs describing studies and most relevant work
experience).
As far as possible, upload them in a single PDF file, rather than individually.
If you are still recruiting, please provide the job profile.
Activity report of last year (if required)
This report should describe your organisation's activities for the last year.
It should be detailed enough to allow us to check your organisation’s aims and activities
and its operational and professional capacity.
No finalised annual report yet? Submit the draft version, certified by your organisation's
legal representative.
No report of this type available? Create one for this application and have it certified by your
legal representative.
Online versions — If your report is available on your website, you can just provide a link
(directly to the document(s), not simply to the homepage) and indicate the link on a
separate sheet and upload it as annex (PDF format).
3.1.4.2 Electronic proposal submission
Electronic proposal submission: Get an EU Login account > Get a PIC number (Participant
Register) > Launch Submission wizard > Pre-register your draft proposal > List participants,
contact persons > Fill in Administrative Forms (Part A) > Upload Technical Description (Part B)
> Submit your proposal > Acknowledgement of receipt
Proposals must be submitted online using the Portal Submission System and before the call
deadline.
Details are explained in the .
Actions to be completed before submission
Create your user account to login to the Portal
To be able to submit a proposal, you must first register on the Portal for an EU Login account.
Make sure all participants are registered (PIC)
All participants (Beneficiaries, Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners) must be
registered in the Participant Register and have their 9-digit Participant Identification Code
(PIC). The Coordinator has to be identified with its PIC number at Step 3 of the Submission
wizard, while other participants at Step 4.
Read more about registration and PIC search in the Registration and validation of your
organisation section.
Submitting the application
35EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The Submission wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process.
Detailed explanations are available in the .
Do not forget to check the system requirements for using the Submission System.
Launch the Submission wizard and enter information for the Administrative
Forms (application form (Part A))
Go to the topic on the Search funding & tenders page > Start Submission.
Upload Part B (Technical Description) and annexes and supporting documents
Part B (and the annexes and supporting documents) can be uploaded in Step 5 of the
wizard. Detailed instructions for preparing these documents are available in the section Get
prepared.
Tips
Do not wait until the end to submit
It is highly recommended to submit your proposalas early as possible and at least 48 hours
before the deadline. This will avoid technical problems (system requirements, local
configuration settings, system congestion, etc).
Please note that you can submit the proposal as many times as you want. Every submitted
version will replace the previous one. Your proposal is sealed and closed. It will not be accessed
before the deadline of the call. There is no reason to delay submission for fear of disclosure.
Affiliated entities
In Step 4 of the wizard you specify the organisations participating in the consortium. As from
2021, this will include Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners. They will therefore need to
have registered beforehand and have their PIC. Their budget will also have to be individualised
already at application stage (separate row in the budget table).
Access rights of individual contact persons
In Step 4 of the wizard you also specify the contact persons for the organisations. To read more
about the levels of access rights, see the Roles and access rights section.
Changes to organisation-related data during proposal preparation
If your organisation is already registered, but organisation-related data has changed during
proposal preparation, you cannot update it directly in the Submission System.
The update must first be requested via the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions >
Modify Organisation):
• by the LEAR (or Account Administrators) for validated entities
• by the Self-registrant if your organisation has not been validated yet.
Page limits and formatting requirements for the Technical Description (Part B)
Don’t forget that applications may have mandatory page limits and formatting requirements
(indicated at the beginning of the application form). Excess pages will be automatically made
invisible, and will not be taken into consideration by the evaluators.
36EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Checklist for submission
Before submitting the proposal, check that:
• your proposal fulfils the call conditions
• the proposal (both the Administrative Forms (Part A) and Technical Description (Part
B)) is complete, readable, accessible and printable
• the requested declarations have been made
• all consortium members have:
obtained a user account to log in to the Portal
o
registered in the Participant Register.
o
Mock evaluation
For some programmes, you can find standard evaluation forms similar to those used by our
evaluators on Portal Reference Documents. Try them out. Ideally, ask a disinterested colleague
to carry out a mock evaluation.
Multiple versions of proposal
You can submit your proposal several times before the deadline, to make updates or changes.
To view or change your submitted proposal, go to My Proposals > View Submitted > Re-edit
proposal. As long as the call has not been closed, the newly submitted version will overwrite
the previous one.
Please note that the re-edit functionality is not available for continuously open calls.
Multiple proposals
If the Coordinator submits a number of similar proposals, the Granting Authority may ask them
to choose one or more of them to be withdrawn.
Specific submission schemes
Two-stage submission schemes — You must submit a short outline proposal for stage 1 and will
be invited to submit a full application only if you pass to stage 2. The full application must be
consistent with the short outline proposal (no substantial differences allowed).
Calls with multiple cut-off dates — The call has a final closure date (usually the end of the
funding programme) and several cut-off dates that trigger evaluation. There is an evaluation
session after each cut-off date and the final closure date (normally within a month). After each
cut-off date, the submitted proposals are grouped, reviewed and ranked together. Evaluation
results are made available and proposals invited for grant preparation. If you miss a cut-off
date, the proposal will be evaluated with the next batch in the next evaluation session.
After submission
At submission, the application package is combined into one document, sealed and an e-receipt
is generated (with date and time of submission).
All contact persons of the coordinating organisation will receive an e-mail (after each submission
if several). If you have not received this e-mail, the application has not been submitted.
Please try again or contact the IT Helpdesk.
After the submission, there is normally no further contact between you and us until after the
end of the evaluation. The competent EU service will contact you only if there is a need to clarify
issues or request additional information or if the call foresees a hearing/interview as part of the
evaluation procedure.
37EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Withdrawal of submitted proposals
Before the call deadline, a proposal can be withdrawn at Step 6 of the wizard (My Proposals >
View Submitted > Withdraw proposal). After the call deadline, withdrawal has to be requested
via the IT Helpdesk.
Once withdrawn, the new status will be shown on the My Proposals page (and you can delete
the application with the Delete button).
After the call deadline
Once the call deadline has passed, no further corrections or re-submissions are possible.
However, you can have read-only access to the submitted proposal (My Proposals > View
Submitted).
Proposals that were never submitted (remain in draft status) are accessible for 90 days after
the call deadline (My Proposals > View Draft).
3.1.5 Complaints about failed submission
If you think that submission of your proposal failed and this was due to a technical error on the
Portal side, you may lodge a complaint through the IT Helpdesk.
The complaint must be filed within 4 calendar days after call closure. You will receive an
acknowledgement of receipt the same or next working day.
What else to do? You should secure a PDF version of the part B and annexes of your application
holding a time stamp before the call deadline (file attributes listing the date and time of creation
and last modification), as well as proof of the alleged failure (screenshots). You may be
requested by the IT Helpdesk to provide these items.
EC services will check the IT logs (application log files and access log files of the Commission
IT systems involved) and see if they show a technical problem on the Portal side which
prevented you from submitting (or resubmitting) the proposal.
You will be notified about the outcome as soon as possible.
If your complaint is justified, the files you provided to the IT Helpdesk will be used as your
proposal and sent for evaluation. If you didn’t provide any files, the last version recorded in the
IT system will be used.

• Proposal Submission System: User Manual
3.2 Selection — From evaluation to grant signature
3.2.1 Admissibility and eligibility check
Once you have submitted a proposal, the Granting Authority will check:
• admissibility (complete and properly put together) and
• eligibility (fulfills eligibility conditions)
and then
• ask an independent evaluation committee to evaluate it.
38EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Admissibility criteria
The admissibility conditions are set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.
They are generally the same across all EU programmes. The proposal must:
• be submitted through the online Submission System before the call deadline
• be complete — application form correctly filled out, all sections of Parts A and B
completed, all annexes and supporting documents provided
• be readable, accessible and printable.
Furthermore, the proposal should respect the page limit set out in the application form. Excess
pages will be automatically made illegible, and will not be taken into consideration by the
evaluators.
Eligibility criteria
The eligibility criteria are also set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.
The basic eligibility check involves for most EU programmes if the content of the proposal is in
line with the topic description and if it involves participants coming from the right countries.
Additional criteria depend on the programme or specific topic (i.e. minimum consortium
composition, type of participant, geographic location of the project activities, coordinator from
an EU country, etc.).
For more information on participation of non-EU participants, see Who can apply section.
Outcome of the admissibility and eligibility check
If a proposal is inadmissible or ineligible, the participants will be informed (through the
coordinating organisation) and the rejection letter will be posted in their Portal library (My
Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Documents).
For complaints procedures against such rejections, see section Complaints about proposal
rejection.
3.2.2 Evaluation
Admissible and eligible proposals are sent on to evaluation by an independent evaluation
committee.
For most programmes the evaluation committee (panel) is made up of EU staff from the
Granting Authority and other services. They are often and assisted by outside experts for
individual evaluation and consensus group evaluation. For some programmes however (e.g.
Horizon Europe), the committee is usually composed exclusively of outside experts — for all
stages of the evaluation process (no internal staff).
The evaluation committee will also take position on the operational capacity of the consortium
and individual participants to properly implement the tasks planned. This assessment will be
based on the competence and experience of the participants, including operational resources
(human, technical and other) and is, for many programmes, integrated into the award criteria.
3.2.2.1 Award criteria
39EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Award criteria, scores thresholds and weighting
Proposals are evaluated and scored against award criteria set out in the call conditions on the
Topic page.
The award criteria, scores, thresholds and weightings depend on each programme and type of
action.
Globally speaking most programmes evaluate the following quality parameters: project
relevance, quality/implementation and impact. But in practice the labels vary and the
parameters are broken down into different aspects and focal points (see call conditions and, for
some programmes, the Programme Guides, e.g. Horizon Europe Programme Guide, Erasmus+
Programme Guide, AGRIP Programme Guide).
To be considered for funding, your proposal must score above a certain threshold for each
individual award criterion, and above an overall threshold for all of them together.
Moreover, in order to receive funding, your proposal must be ranked sufficiently to be above
the budget-threshold (relative positioning in the list of all proposals, compared to the other
proposals). For calls which provide for weightings, this ranking will also depend on the
weighting.
Your proposals will be evaluated on its own merit, and not its potential should certain
changes be made. Proposals with an inflated budget are likely to receive a lower score.
3.2.2.2 Evaluation and evaluation results
Evaluation process
Briefing
Evaluation: Individual evaluation > Consensus group > Panel review
Briefing of evaluators
Before starting the evaluation process, the evaluators are briefed on:
• the evaluation processes and procedures (including award criteria)
• the content of the topics under consideration
• the need to evaluate proposals as they were submitted, rather than their potential
should certain changes be made
• for outside experts: the terms of their contract (confidentiality, impartiality, conflicts of
interest, completing tasks and approving reports, penalties for non-compliance, etc).
For most EU programmes, there is no scope for recommending improvements to proposals
(including improvements on the budget).
Individual evaluation
During the individual evaluation, the evaluators work individually. Each evaluator gives a score
for each criterion, with explanatory comments, and prepares an individual evaluation report
(IER).
40EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Proposals are normally evaluated by at least three individual evaluators (for some programmes
and types of action, two may suffice; for many it is five).
The evaluators should also indicate if they consider that the proposal:
• is out of scope or
• involves security issues that will need further scrutiny.
Consensus group
After the individual evaluation, all evaluators who have evaluated the proposal will get together
in a consensus group, to agree on a common position on comments and scores.
For consensus groups made up of outside experts, the group will normally be assisted by a
member of the Granting Authority staff who will act as moderator to:
• seek a consensus, impartially and
• ensure that each proposal is evaluated fairly, according to the award criteria.
Panel review
After the consensus phase, the evaluation committee (panel) will take over and discuss the
proposals to:
• reach an agreement on the scores and comments for all proposals evaluated together,
checking consistency across the evaluations
• if necessary, propose a new set of marks or revise comments, and resolve cases where
evaluators were unable to agree
• rank the above-threshold proposals and give a priority order for proposals with the same
score.
Proposals with the same score
The evaluation committee will recommend a priority order for proposals with the same score,
using the procedure set out in the call conditions.
Interviews/hearings
If provided for in the call conditions, the evaluation committee (panel) may arrange
interviews/hearings.
In this case, invitations are sent to the coordinators of above-threshold proposals (and,
sometimes, also to those with scores above individual thresholds but below the overall
qualifying threshold).
The interviews/hearings may be held remotely or on site, in Brussels.
The questions to be asked will be determined by the panel beforehand and sent to all proposals.
The interviews/hearings will be used to get further information to clarify the proposals and help
the panel establish its final ranking list and scores. They may not serve to change proposals or
add missing information.
Outcome of evaluation
41EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
On the basis of the report and ranked list provided by the evaluation committee (panel), the
Granting Authority reviews the evaluation result, puts together the final ranking list and
informs the participants.
You can find the timing the evaluation and information on evaluation results in the call
conditions on the Topic page.
Final ranking — Reserve list — Rejections
The Granting Authority produces the final ranked list and the list of applications proposed
for funding.
The number of proposals in the list depends on the available budget. If the available budget is
too small to fund all above-threshold proposals (normally the case because EU grants are
heavily oversubscribed), some proposals may be put on a reserve list. These will then be
offered funding if a higher-scoring project does not go ahead or additional funds become
available.
The below-threshold proposals will be rejected.
Proposals will NOT be offered funding if the Granting Authority finds that it is already funding
very similar work elsewhere, or a proposal is in any way manifestly contrary to EU general
principles or established EU priorities or policies.
Evaluation result letters — Evaluation summary report
The participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) about their evaluation
result (together with the evaluation summary report (ESR)) and it will be posted in their Portal
library (My Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation >
Documents).
If your proposal was successful, you will get a grant preparation invitation letter. To follow
the further steps of preparing your grant, you will be prompted for each of the actions that need
to be carried out. Details are explained in the next section Grant preparation.
42EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please note that invitation to grant preparation is NOT a formal commitment for funding. The
final decision on your project will only be taken at a later stage — this depends on the finalisation
of grant preparation and further checks which we still need to make (i.e. financial capacity, non-
exclusion, etc).
If your proposal was not succesful, you will receive a rejection letter. The means of redress for
such rejections are described in the section Complaints about proposal rejection.
3.2.3 Special procedures: Ethics review, security scrutiny,
Ownership control check
Ethics review
In order to avoid funding of ethically problematic activities, some funding programmes require
an ethics review procedure to clear the projects (e.g. Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, EU4H,
AMIF).
The details and the scope of the ethics review depend on each programme. Most programmes
simply check whether projects raise ethics issues and, if so, whether these are adequately
addressed. Some programmes, such as Horizon Europe, have a more elaborated review
procedure which includes several steps depending on the complexity of the issues (see Horizon
Europe Programme Guide).
The participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) of the ethics review
result and it will be posted in their Portal library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Document Library).
If the ethics review leads to requirements to be implemented before grant signature, you will
need to take immediate action to comply (and may also have to adapt the description of the
action (DoA Part B) to reflect this). If the review leads to additional requirements to be fulfilled
during the project, they are automatically added as ethics deliverables into the system and DoA
Part A and will be placed in an automatically generated work package called ethics
requirements. If the review shows that there are serious ethics issues that cannot be solved,
funding may have to be refused.
You may be asked to provide additional information if this is needed to complete the ethics
review (e.g. in case of serious or complex ethics issues or missing information).

• How to complete your ethics self-assessment
Security scrutiny
In order to ensure that classified information (for EU classified information (EUCI), see Decision
2015/444) is protected from unauthorised disclosure and that security issues emerging from
project activities are appropriately addressed, some EU programmes systematically provide for
a security review procedure for applications that operate in security relevant contexts (e.g.
European Defence Fund, Horizon Europe, Digital Europe).
The details and the scope of the security review depend on each programme. Some
programmes, such as Horizon Europe and Digital Europe, have a more elaborated security
review procedure which includes several steps depending on whether the topic under which a
proposal is submitted is flagged by the Commission as security sensitive or not (see Horizon
Europe Programme Guide).
43EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The security scrutiny (which is the final step of the more elaborated security review) is
essentially the same for all programmes: proposals must be cleared by the Security Scrutiny
Group (composed of national security experts nominated in agreement with their national
security authorities (NSAs)). The Security Scrutiny Group will determine the level of sensitivity
of the application and check whether all security aspects are being handled appropriately. You
will be informed about the result through your coordinator.
If the security scrutiny leads to requirements to be implemented before grant signature, you
will need to take immediate action to comply. If the scrutiny leads to classification and additional
requirements to be fulfilled during the project, this will be automatically reflected in the system
(classification of existing deliverables, limited dissemination of existing deliverables due to
security reasons, security aspect letter (SAL), security classification guide (SCG), appointment
of project security officer, establishment of security advisory board, etc.). If the scrutiny shows
that the project is too security sensitive, funding may have to be refused.

• How to handle security-sensitive projects
Third country control
Some programmes (or calls) limit the participation of entities which are controlled by third
countries (e.g. European Defence Fund, Digital Europe, Horizon Europe, CEF). In this case, a
special procedure is needed to verify ownership control of participants.

3.2.4 Grant preparation
Grant preparation
The Grant Agreement must be prepared directly in the Portal Grant Management System.
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Grant agreement data
preparation.
Who? The Grant Agreement data should be prepared by the consortium participants together
and submitted by the Coordinator.
How? You will be prompted by e-mail for all the actions that you need to carry out for the grant
preparation. For more details, see the list of grant-related notifications.
What? The grant preparation process consists of:
• setting up the Portal Grant Management System with the:
participants’ legal, administrative and financial information
o
description of the action (DoA, Annex 1 GA)
o
estimated budget (Annex 2 and 2a GA)
o
project variables (when the project starts, reporting periods, amount of
o
prefinancing, GA options, etc)
44EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
legal documents needed for grant signature (declarations of honour)
o
• so that the system can generate the Grant Agreement
and
• trigger signature directly inside the system (Grant Agreement and Accession Forms).
In parallel, the Granting Authority will perform the remaining legal checks to ensure that all the
successful proposals can receive EU funding (legal entity validation, financial capacity check,
non-exclusion check, etc).
Our Grant Agreement clauses are common to all EU programmes and mandatory for all
beneficiaries. They are explained in more detail in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
Grant preparation process
Enter & submit grant data: Entering legal, administrative & financial data > Preparing the
Description of the Action (DoA)
Signing the Grant Agreement
Description of the Action (DoA) (Part A and B)
The description of the action (DoA, Annex 1) is structured like the application form into
two parts, Parts A and B:
• Part A: contains the structured tables with project information (retrieved from the Grant
Management System tabs)
• Part B (the narrative part): is based on Part B of the application form and must be
uploaded as a PDF.
Creating Part B of the DoA is straightforward, as it can be derived directly from Part B of the
application. The instructions for this are available on Portal Reference Documents.
The system will merge the Parts A and B, generating a single PDF with the full description of
the action (DoA).
All participants can contribute to the parts, but it is the Coordinator who will have to finalise
and submit it.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Workplan tables: Complete the workplan tables in Part A, (work package descriptions,
deliverables and milestones)
• Check that all PICs have been validated by the Central Validation Service
• Quality check:
Check that the DoA is coherent and that information in Part A and B is consistent.
Some programmes will ask you not to simply attach the application, but to adapt Part
B. In this case, try to avoid overlaps between Parts A and B (delete work plan tables
from Part B, etc).
Check that DoA and the application match: please check if the content of the DoA differs
from the application, as this must be in compliance with your invitation letter to start
grant preparation. In addition, you may correct shortcomings identified by the experts
in the evaluation summary report. The information presented in the DoA can be made
45EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
more consistent if necessary. Any errors should be corrected (data displayed in a table
or figure is at odds with the description, etc).
Check that the DoA and the legal and administrative information match: for example, it
must describe the role and tasks performed by each Partner (Coordinator, Beneficiary,
Affiliated Entity, Third party providing in-kind contributions, etc) defined in the
structured part.
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed and no
annexes are missing.
Termination of grant preparation
If the consortium decides against the grant during grant preparation, they can launch the
termination process directly in the Portal. See the detailed screens and descriptions in the
on grant preparation termination.
This type of termination works only during grant preparation. Afterwards (after grant
signature), the grant must be formally terminated by amending the GA (early termination
amendment).

3.2.4.1 Enter & submit grant data
Actions to be completed before grant preparation
Organise access rights and roles
All Beneficiaries need access rights in order to prepare their grant data in the system and
sign the legal documents (declarations of honour, Grant Agreements and Accession Forms).
The contact persons of each organisation indicated in the proposal will automatically receive
access rights during grant preparation:
Proposal Grant preparation
Person who created the application ou PCoCo
submit the proposal?
Contact persons with full access rights CoCos (for Coordinator) + PaCos (for
other Beneficiaries)
46EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Contact persons with read-only rights Team Members (TeMes)
In addition, if your organisation has already been validated, the LEAR will normally also
already have been appointed.
Other persons and roles (especially LSIGNs and FSIGNs) will have to be appointed first by
the LEAR (My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation Roles > Add Roles) and then
assigned to the project by the CoCos and PaCos (My Projects > Actions > Project
Consortium > Edit Roles).
The minimum setup of roles that you need to prepare and conclude the Grant Agreement
are the following:
• for the Coordinator:
Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo) — already appointed
o
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
o
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN)
o
• for other Beneficiaries:
Participant Contact (PaCo)
o
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
o
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN).
o
The same person can fulfil several or all of the above roles.
Our system allows for only one signature on your side. If your internal rules require
several signatories, you must give an internal mandate to one of them and ensure that the
electronic signature in our system is executed only after all the necessary internal
authorisations were given. These authorisations must be collected, stored and kept by you
in line with your usual management practices (usually paper-based) so that they can be
provided to us in case of EU controls, checks or audits.
More details about nomination are in the Roles and access rights section.
Make sure all participants are registered and validated (PIC)
All Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities must be registered and validated in time for grant
signature (see section on Registration and validation of your organisation).
Associated Partners need to be only registered (have a PIC); no validation is needed,
because they will not receive any grant money.
Prepare and sign a consortium agreement (always recommended; in many
cases mandatory)
Consortium agreements are mandatory for many EU programmes. But even if they are not,
it is highly recommended to have arrangements in place to cover consortium-internal issues
that may arise during the project (e.g. decision-making procedures, resolve conflicts,
safeguard intellectual property rights, etc). The consortium agreement should be signed
before the Grant Agreement. For details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 7
and the How to establish your H2020 consortium agreement.
47EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Enter legal, administrative & financial data
You need to prepare the Grant Agreement in the Portal Grant Management System.
Details are explained in the .
Enter the structured information into the system (Part A of the DoA)
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation
> Grant agreement data preparation and transfer the information from your application
form (Part B) to the Work Packages, Deliverables, Milestones and Critical Risks screens.
You can move work packages up and down by drag & drop to position them in the order of
your preference. When a work package is moved to a new position, the numbering of WPs
(and also the relative numbering of deliverables) is automatically adapted.
Enter the other grant data into the system
a) Set the project starting date
Set the date on which the project is to start (starting date of the action) on the Project
Summary screen.
The options may vary depending on programme and type of action (see call conditions),
but generally there are 2 options:
• the first day of the month after entry into force (signature by EU) — default
option
• if needed, a fixed starting date may be agreed — this should be the first day of
a month and normally after grant signature (unless authorised otherwise by the
Granting Authority).
If you enter a fixed starting date, you will be asked to justify your choice. If you
chose a starting date before grant signature, you must explain why your project requires
this. Please note that the starting date can normally NOT be before the date on which
your application was submitted (unless explicitly allowed in the call conditions). Please
also note that any project activities taking place before grant signature bear the risk
that the grant may finally not be signed.
b) Check the project reporting periods
The reporting periods will be pre-filled for each call on the Reporting Periods screen.
To minimise administrative burden for you, we will choose the smallest possible number
of reporting periods. On average, most programmes tend to have reporting periods
between 12 and 18 months.
c) Check the prefinancing for the project
The standard prefinancing percentage will be pre-filled for each call on the Project
Financial Information screen.
The final prefinancing amount for each project will however be fixed only later, once the
budgetary information is completed from your side and the Granting Authority has
examined the results from the financial capacity assessment (see section Financial
capacity assessment). The prefinancing may be lowered in case of low financial capacity.
48EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
d) Complete the legal and administrative information for the participants
Fill in the missing information for each participant on the Partner Summary screen and
complete the Affiliated Entities and Associated Partner screens.
e) Define the budgets for the participants
Fill in the budget for each participant on the Partner Financial Information screens.
Make sure the budget details match the proposal and the GAP invitation letter (and the
detailed budget table, if required).
f) Provide the banking details for the Coordinator
Select the bank account to be used for payments from the dropdown menu on the
Coordinator’s Bank Account screen.
If your preferred bank account is not listed, you must ask your LEAR to add the bank
account in the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
Once the new bank account has been validated (this may take a few days), it will appear
in the dropdown menu and you will be able to select it.
f) Enter other information as prompted
Upload Part B of the description of the action (DoA)
Upload Part B on the Documents screen. Follow the instructions from Portal Reference
Documents.
Sign the declarations of honour (DoH)
For each Beneficiary, the PLSIGN must sign a declaration of honour (DoH) directly in the
system (grant declaration) .
Affiliated entities also need to sign a DoH. For them, the responsible Beneficiary must
download the template from Portal Reference Documents, ask each entity to complete and
sign it, then upload the scanned DoHs for their linked third parties.
Joint and several liability of Affiliated Entities (if required)
If the Granting Authority requires joint and several liability of an Affiliated Entity, the
declaration on joint and several liability must be submitted together with the Accession
Form.
The Beneficiary must download the form prepared by the system, ask the Affiliated Entity
to sign it and upload the scanned declaration when signing the Accession Form.
For more details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 22.
Prefinancing guarantee (if required)
If the Granting Authority requires a prefinancing guarantee, you need to obtain this from
a bank or approved financial institution (using the template available on Portal Reference
Documents), send a scanned copy through Portal Formal Notifications (My Projects >
Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) and
the original by registered post with proof of delivery to the mail address of the service
responsible for your grant.
49EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
For more details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 23.
Submit grant preparation to the Granting Authority
Assessment by the Granting Authority and finalisation of GA data
The Project Officer will enter the EU grant preparation data (GA options, etc) and check the
data submitted by the consortium. If needed, they will send back the session to the
consortium for changes/addition information (ping-pong).
Tips
Changes to consortium composition/project during grant preparation
Please note that consortia/projects can be altered ONLY under exceptional circumstances,
and ONLY if duly justified.
Nonetheless, there may be circumstances where you may need to change/adjust the consortium
composition/project before grant signature (bankruptcy, merger/acquisition, loss of a key
member of staff that is needed to carry out the project, etc).
In this case, your Coordinator should contact the EU Project Officer explain why and propose a
solution (reassign tasks and budget within the consortium or to a new participant, adjustments
to the project, etc).
If accepted, you may need to update the Grant Management System screens and upload a new
Part B.
Please note that the proposals may NOT be substantially changed and that all changed
elements must comply with the call conditions for the call. Redistribution of tasks must be in
line with the competences of the participants concerned and the quality of the
project/consortium must be guaranteed.
If no acceptable solution is presented, we will request you to withdraw the proposal and
terminate grant preparation.
Deadlines
In the interest of all sides, we will try to handle grant preparation as swiftly as possible (ideally
3 months after you receive the GAP invitation letter).
To make this happen, we will ask you to comply with relatively strict deadlines during grant
preparation:
• Preparation grant data & annexes (first version): 3 weeks after GAP invitation letter
• Finalisation grant data & annexes: up to 2 weeks after reply by Project Officer
• Sign declaration of honour (DoH): at the latest 6 weeks after GAP invitation letter.
• Grant signature: 3 months from GAP invitation letter
Deadlines can be extended under exceptional circumstances by the EU Project Officer.
Please note that if you have not been granted an extension, and fail to meet the established
deadlines, preparation of your Grant Agreement may be terminated and your proposal rejected.
3.2.4.2 Final legal checks
50EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
During grant preparation, we will also finalise the mandatory legal checks (legal entity
validation, operational and financial capacity, exclusion and double funding).
In case of issues, we may need to contact you.
3.2.5 Grant signature
Signing the Grant Agreement is the last step of the grant preparation phase. It is done directly
in the Portal Grant Management System (electronic signature) and demonstrates that both
contracting parties formally approve the agreement and its annexes.
The Grant Agreement enters into force with the last signature (normally the EU because the
Coordinator usually signs first).
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Sign.
Who? The Grant Agreement is signed by the EU and the Coordinator. The other Beneficiaries
do not sign the Grant Agreement itself, but accede to the Grant Agreement through Accession
Forms. Affiliated Entities or Associated Partners do not sign and do not become formal parties
to the Agreement.
How? You will receive e-mail notifications prompting the tasks needed for grant signature. For
more detail, see the list of grant-related notifications.
Signing EU Grant Agreements electronically —
What's involved?
The electronic signature in the Portal requires:
• a chain of trust with Beneficiaries — to guarantee signatories' identity
• a system of digital signatures protected by multiple security features — to guarantee
documents' reliability and authenticity
This type of electronic signature is used for signature of contracts, amendments and cost claims
(Financial Statements and invoices).
The chain of trust
LEAR
The Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR) appointed by the Beneficiary’s legal
representative (signed LEAR documents uploaded in the Participant Register) is the
centrepiece of the chain of trust. More in the section LEAR appointment and validation.
LEAR appoints all LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation
The LEAR vouches for the organisation data entered into the system and the nominated
persons. They appoint the individuals authorised to sign:
51EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Grant Agreements and amendments (Legal Signatories, known as LSIGNs)
• Financial Statements (Financial Signatories, known as FSIGNs).
The LEAR is responsible for keeping these lists constantly updated.
PaCO selects LSIGN and FSIGN for project
Participant Contacts (PaCo) or Coordinator Contacts (CoCos) have to select the Project
Legal Signatories (PLSIGNs) and Financial Signatories (PFSIGNs) from the LSIGN and
FSIGN lists nominated by the LEAR. For more information, check the section on Roles and
access rights.
Closed system where access rights are strictly controlled.
The chain of trust is built in a closed electronic exchange system. Each individual must
identify themselves with their personal EU Login account and access is strictly controlled.
Signing the Grant Agreement
Sign the declarations of honour (DoH)
Before the Grant Agreement can be signed, the PLSIGN of each Beneficiary must sign a
declaration of honour (grant declaration). For more details, see Enter legal administrative
& financial grant data.
Grant agreement ready for signature
The system prepares the Grant Agreement for signing (PDF document, digitally sealed to
guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).
Coordinator signs the Grant Agreement
The Coordinator's PLSIGN logs into the Portal My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Sign.
52EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
During signature, a pop-up explains that this means the signatory is preparing to sign. It
then asks the PLSIGN to confirm that they wish to sign and a second prompt asks the
PLSIGN to enter their EU Login password.
After signature, the system creates a new version of the PDF document (with a digital seal,
a time stamp, and the signatory's EU Login credentials on the signature placeholder). The
validity of the signature can be verified by opening it in a compatible PDF reader and clicking
on the image of the digital signature.
The Grant Agreement can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature)
from the Documents screen if desired.
The LEAR of the Coordinator and the other Beneficiaries are informed that the Coordinator
has signed the Grant Agreement.
Granting authority signs the Grant Agreement
The EU Authorising Officer is prompted to countersign the Grant Agreement from their side
(same procedure as under point 3).
The Participants will be informed and the countersigned Grant Agreement will be available
in their Portal Library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Document Library).
Participants sign the Accession forms
All other Beneficiaries' PLSIGNs are prompted to sign their Accession Forms (same
procedure as under point 3) — within 30 days after entry into force (signature by EU).
The CoCos and LEAR of the Coordinator and PaCo and LEAR of the concerned Beneficiary
are notified when an Accession Form has been signed.
Grant Agreement is finalised
Not signed Grant Agreement
• If the Coordinator does not sign, the Granting Authority may stop preparing the grant
and reject the proposal.
• If a Beneficiary does not sign the Accession Form within 30 days of the Grant Agreement
entering into force, the Granting Authority may terminate the Grant Agreement. In this
case, in order to continue with the project, the Coordinator must: request an
amendment, so that any changes needed to ensure that the project is carried out
properly can be made.
This request must be made within 30 days after the missed deadline for signing
o
the Accession Form.
The request for an amendment does not affect the Granting Authority's right to
o
terminate the Grant Agreement.
The Accession Form template is available for information on Portal Reference
Documents.
Project starting date
The project starting date is calculated as from the entry into force of the Grant Agreement (last
signature = signature by the EU).
53EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Prefinancing
The entry into force and starting date also determine the baseline date for the prefinancing (i.e.
the float that we normally pay immediately after grant signature).
Depending on the programme (see call conditions), prefinancing is either paid 30 days from:
• Horizon Europe, Digital, SMP, etc: the entry into force or 10 days before the starting
date or submission of the prefinancing guarantee (if required) — depending on which
is the latest
or
• CEF, LIFE, EMFAF, Erasmus, etc: the entry into force or submission of the prefinancing
guarantee (if required) — depending on which is the latest.

3.2.6 Complaints about proposal rejection
If you believe that the rejection of your proposal was based on an error in the selection
procedure, you can submit a complaint (following the deadlines and procedures set out in the
evaluation result letter).
Generally, the means of redress are the following:
• request for admissibility/eligibility or evaluation review (redress review) — within 30
days of receiving the letter
• for decisions by EU executive agencies: request for review of legality under Article 22
of Regulation 58/2003 — within 1 month of receiving the letter (using the Article 22
complaints form template)
• action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU — within 2 months of receiving the letter.
You are free to choose any of the above means of redress. However, in the interest of good
administration and procedural efficiency, it is recommended to use first the available
administrative review procedures (if any). The objective of these procedures is to re-examine
the circumstances of the selection procedure and to reach a final decision on your application.
Deadlines for further redress will therefore run as from when you receive our reply with the
final position.
Please note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending are
considered to have been accessed and that the deadlines will be counted from opening/access
(see Portal Terms and Conditions).
Complaints will be subject to the following conditions:
• Complaints must focus on aspects concerning the evaluation of the proposals (e.g.
admissibility or eligibility checks, evaluation procedure, etc), not their merits. Thus,
applicants can raise procedural irregularities, factual errors, manifest errors of
assessment or abuse of powers (e.g. lack of coherence between scores and comments,
lack or inadequate reasoning of the conclusions, the existence of a conflict of interests,
exceeding the limits of discretion, etc). Mere repetitions of the content of the proposal
or disagreements with the result or reasoning of the technical evaluation will not be
considered.
54EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Only one request for review per proposal will be considered. The request cannot refer
to the evaluation of proposals submitted by other applicants or under different or
previous calls.
• Review requests will not always necessarily also lead to a re-evaluation of your proposal
(new technical evaluation with new group of evaluators). The administrative review
procedure will re-examine your case, but a re-evaluation will be decided only if your
complaint demonstrates that the procedural irregularity, factual error, manifest error of
assessment or abuse of powers affects the decision on whether to fund the proposal.
Thus, for example, a problem relating to one of the evaluation criteria will not lead to a
re-evaluation if, even by adding the maximum points under this criterion, the final score
of the proposal would still remain below the threshold for funding.
• Re-evaluations will be made on the proposal as it was originally submitted; no additional
information will be admitted. Re-evaluations will be partial (limited to the criterion
affected by the error) or full (when the whole evaluation has been recognized as flawed)
— depending on the case. They may be assigned to the same evaluation panel or a new
one, depending on the internal procedures of the Granting Authority.
• The score following a re-evaluation may be lower than the original score.
• All requests for review will be treated as confidential.
Please pay attention to who took the formal decision and who the complaint must be addressed
to. If a decision was taken by an EU executive agency or other EU body, both redress review
and applications for annulment must be directed against that agency/body (NOT against the
European Commission). Only Article 22 complaints must be addressed to the respective
Directorate-General of the Commission (parent DG of the executive agency).
In case you consider that there has been maladministration on our part, you can also address
a complaint to the European Ombudsman — within 2 years after you became aware of it AND
after having used all the means of administrative redress available (redress and Article 22
request, if any).
3.3 Grant management
3.3.1 Keeping records
All participants must keep records and other supporting documentation in order to prove
the proper implementation and the costs claimed (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art
20).
For Lump Sum grants, records on costs incurred are exceptionally NOT needed; it is enough to
keep the evidence to prove the proper implementation of the action.

3.3.2 Amendments
Amendments requested by the consortium
55EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If there are any changes to the Grant Agreement (e.g. data or options specific to that
agreement) or its annexes, they must be done through a formal amendment directly in the
Portal (electronic signature).
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Request for Amendment.
Who? Amendments can be prepared by the consortium participants together, but only the
Coordinator can launch, sign and submit them.
The EU Granting Authority can also propose amendments, but for practical reasons we will often
as you to initiate the procedure.
When? Amendments must normally be done before the end of the project, but some
amendment clauses are also open afterwards (addition of Beneficiary/Affiliated
Entity/Associated Partner, change of Coordinator, change of Annex 1, change of Annex 2,
change of bank account, error amendments, etc).
What? Cases requiring a formal amendment are listed in the AGA — Annotated Grant
Agreement, art 39. See also How to prepare an amendment in the .
Amendments are normally NOT necessary for:
• budget transfers covered by the budget flexibility
• name or address changes of a participant — done directly in the Participant Register
• universal takeovers (merger/acquisition) of a participant — done directly in the
Participant Register
• changes of the banking details — done directly in the Participant Register.
The signed amendment is the legal document containing the changes to the Grant
Agreement. It is legally binding and will be incorporated into the Agreement. The consolidated
version is only for information.
Amendment process
Get ready > Launch amendment > Amendment preparation > Consult Commission >
Sign&Submit > Assessment > Countersign
Amendment request
The amendment request consists of:
• updated structured information on the Grant Management System screens
• amendment request letter: the letter with the request and reasons for the amendment
• amendment core (including new version of GA Annexes 1 and 2, if needed): the legal
document with the list of amendment clauses
• supporting documents: documents uploaded by the consortium, consolidated Grant
Agreement, etc
All participants can contribute to the amendment, but it is the Coordinator who will have to
launch, finalise, submit and sign the request.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
56EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Check that the updated information Grant Management System screens is correct.
• Quality check: Check that the Amendment documents are correct and all supporting
documents attached.
Actions to be completed before amendment
Make sure new participants are registered and validated (PIC)
New Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities must be registered and validated in the Participant
Register before the amendment can be requested (see section on Registration and
validation of your organisation).
Associated Partners need to be only registered (have a PIC); no validation is needed,
because they will not receive any grant money from us.
Make sure that new bank accounts are registered and validated
New banking information must be registered and validated in the Participant Register
before an amendment can be requested (see section on Bank account registration and
validation).
Submitting an amendment
Amendments must be prepared in the Portal Grant Management System.
Details are explained in the .

Before launching your amendment request, prepare the supporting documents and, if
needed, discuss the request beforehand with the EU Project Officer (— recommended for
more complicated cases).
Launch the amendment
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU >
Request for Amendment
Amendment reference number (ID) — Once you have launched the request, the
amendment is automatically assigned a reference number. Please use this unique identifier
in all contacts with the Granting Authority during the amendment process.
Change the grant data in the system
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Amendment > Amendment preparation.
Once the amendment is been launched, you can amend the grant data in the same way as
as you did when preparing the Grant Agreement.
Enter the amendment information into the system
a) Justification
57EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Fill out the field to justify the request on the Amendment Information screen.
b) Amendment clauses
On the basis of the changes to the grant data, the system will automatically select the
relevant amendment types (automatic clauses) on the Amendment Information screen.
Other types of amendment have to be selected manually by the EU Project Officer,
(change of Annex 1, change in the maximum grant amount, resuming the action after
suspension, etc). Contact the Project Officer to activate the clause.
In case a change triggers the need for another change, a prompt will appear.
Upload annexes and supporting documents
You will be prompted to upload mandatory supporting documents. These depend on the
type of amendment and the specific case (e.g. a new Beneficiary must provide the DoH
and the Accession Form).
Consult Granting Authority
Once ready, the amendment request must be submitted to the Granting Authority for
informal assessment.
Informal assessment by the Granting Authority
The Project Officer will check that the amendment request is correct and admissible. If
needed, they will send it back to the consortium for changes/additional information (ping-
pong).
Coordinator signs & submits the amendment request
Once the request for an amendment is complete and ready to be submitted, the system
generates the 2 documents (amendment request letter and amendment core) for signature
(PDF document, digitally signed to guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).
The Coordinator’s PLSIGN logs into My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Amendment
> Sign & Submit (same procedure as for Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant
Agreement).
The amendment can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature) from
the Documents screen if desired.
As Coordinator, you cannot alter a request for an amendment once it has been signed
and submitted. There are 2 options:
• You withdraw it.
• The Granting Authority rejects it (amendment rejection letter).
Formal assessment by the Granting Authority
The Granting Authority has 45 days to accept or reject the request.
This deadline will be extended if needed (e.g. if the amendment are complex, specific
compliance checks are needed for a new participant, or if the project has to be reviewed to
assess the changes).
58EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Granting authority signs the amendment
Acceptance: If the Granting Authority accepts the request, they countersign it from their
side (same procedure as for Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant Agreement).
The Coordinator and Beneficiaries will be informed and the countersigned amendment will
be available in their Portal Library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Project
Library).
Rejection: If the request is rejected, the consortium will be informed by amendment
rejection letter.
Amendment number — Once the amendment is countersigned, it is automatically assigned
a sequential amendment number (1, 2, 3, etc). For instance, an amendment request with
the reference AMD-345622-6 is assigned number 2 if it is the 2nd signed amendment for
the grant. Rejected amendments are assigned a number (R1, R2); but they are saved, so
that they can be reused to draw up a new request.
The Coordinator’s PLSIGN can withdraw a submitted request until it is countersigned.
Withdrawn requests are saved and can be reused to submit a new request.
Entry into force & taking effect
An amendment proposed by a consortium enters into force on the day the Granting Authority
signs it.
It takes effect (i.e. the changes to the Grant Agreement start to apply) either:
• on a specific date specified in the amendment or
• on the date of entry into force (last signature = signature by the EU).
Depending on the nature of the amendment, the date on which it takes effect may affect
the eligibility of costs (e.g. if a Beneficiary is added, costs are eligible from the accession date
specified in the Accession Form).
Coordinator change without their agreement
If the Coordinator is to be replaced without their agreement, another Beneficiary (acting on
behalf of the other Beneficiaries in the consortium) must submit the amendment request.
To do this, you will need to contact the EU Project Officer, so that they can give you
(exceptional) PCoCo access rights in the system.
Please note you will have to provide proof both of the consortium decision to change the
Coordinator, to nominate you to act on their behalf AND the opinion of the changed Coordinator
(or at least proof that the opinion was requested) — otherwise the termination will be considered
improper.
Amendments initiated by the Granting Authority
If the Granting Authority requests an amendment, the request is also prepared and signed
electronically in the Portal Grant Management System.
You will receive an e-mail notification prompting you to accept the request.
To do so, the Coordinator's PLSIGN must countersign the amendment on the consortium's
behalf.

3.3.3 Continuous reporting on milestones & deliverables
During the project, you are expected to provide regular updates on the status of the project:
the continuous reporting.
The continuous reporting includes:
• progress in achieving milestones
• deliverables
• updates to the publishable summary
• response to critical risks, publications, communications activities, IPRs
• programme-specific monitoring information (if required).
Where? The Continuous Reporting Module is accessible through the link you receive at the
beginning of the project.
Who? Milestones and deliverables should be submitted by each participant for their work.
What? You should report on milestones and deliverables in accordance with the schedule set
out for them.
The Continuous Reporting Module also allows you to report on critical risks, prepare the
summary for publication and the programme-specific information on indicators (e.g. Trainings,
Gender, Open Data, etc — if available for your programme and type of action).
Milestones — Control points in the project that help to chart progress (kick-off meetings,
steering committes, first-draft of a survey, prototype, etc). They may correspond to the
completion of a key deliverable, which allows the next phase of the work to begin or is needed
at intermediary points.
Deliverables — Outputs to be submitted to the EU (publication, leaflet, progress report,
brochure, list, etc).
All this information is automatically compiled to create part A of the periodic Technical Report,
at the moment this report is prepared (Locked for review).
Reporting in the Continuous Reporting Module
At the beginning of the project, you will receive a notification (+ link) that the Continuous
Reporting Module is activated and that you can contribute to it on an ongoing basis.
Detailed information on the Module can be found in the .
Update the project summary
60EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please note that you must provide a separate summary for each periodic report (just
update the summary for the previous period).
The summary must be suitable for direct publication by the Granting Authority,
especially:
• be a stand-alone text — no references to other parts of the report, only to publicly
available information.
• easily understandable by a general audience
• preferably not longer than 7,480 characters (roughly 2 pages)
• with no confidential/sensitive data
You can upload diagrams or photographs illustrating and promoting your project work (
only as images and you must have cleared any rights of third parties advance).
You can also mention the websites used to promote the EU project (see section
Communicating and promoting the project).
Update the deliverables
The deliverables must be submitted according to the timing specified in the Continuous
Reporting section.
At the time the periodic report is submitted, check if all deliverables due have been
provided and, if not, give an explanation in the Comments column (especially for missing
or late deliverables and/or cancelled or grouped deliverables).
Update the milestones
Specify whether the milestones were achieved or not. If not, enter an estimate of when.
The milestones table included in each periodic report is cumulative (it shows all milestones
from the beginning of the project).
Update the critical risks
Assess the state of play of the listed risks and if necessary specify new mitigation
measures or add newly identified risks.
Programme-specific monitoring information (if required)
Some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) have additional policy-monitoring screens on
indicators which require input (Publications, Dissemination, Patents (IPR), SME
participation, Gender, Infrastructure, Innovation, Open data, ABS Regulation, Trainings).

3.3.4 Reports & payment requests
61EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
In order to receive payments, the consortium must submit periodic reports (following the
schedule set out in the Grant Agreement). When these are due, they must be submitted directly
in the Periodic Reporting Module of the Portal Grant Management System.
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Technical Part contribution/Financial Statement
drafting.
Who? The periodic report should be prepared by the consortium participants together and
submitted by the Coordinator.
How? You will be prompted by e-mail for all the actions that you need to carry out for the
periodic reporting.
What? In the periodic report, you should report on the progress of the work and costs claimed
(see below Periodic Report). When the Coordinator submits the periodic report, the IT tool will
capture the information from the Continuous Reporting Module in order to generate the Part A
of the Technical Report. The system will also consolidate the Individual Financial Statements
and it will generate the use of resources report (if required) and the Summary Financial
Statements (for the consortium).
Reporting process
Continuous reporting > Preparing your periodic report > Approving Partners' reports >
Submitting the report to the Commission > Acceptance or rejection by the Commission >
Interim payment
Periodic report: Technical Report (Part A and B) and Financial Report
The periodic report consists of two parts, the Technical Report and Financial Report.
The Technical Report is itself also divided in two parts, Parts A and B:
Part A: contains the structured tables with project information (retrieved from the Grant
Management System).
Part B (the narrative part): mirrors the application form and requires the participants to report
on differences (delays, work not implemented, new subcontracts, budget overruns etc). It must
be uploaded as PDF document.
The Financial Report consists of the structured individual and consolidated Financial
Statements (retrieved from the Grant Management System). In addition, most programmes
require either a detailed cost reporting table (excel table) or the use of resources report (online
wizard) and, for payments above a certain thresholds, a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS).
The technical report Part A and the financial report is generated automatically on the basis of
the data in the Grant Management System; Part B needs to be prepared outside the tools (using
62EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
the template downloaded from the system) and then uploaded as PDF (together with Annexes,
if any).
All participants should contribute to the parts, but it is the Coordinator who will have to submit
them as a single report.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Check that the Continuous Reporting Module is updated in time (before the Periodic
Report is Locked for review).
• Check that all participants have submitted their Financial Statements (and CFS, if
needed)
• Quality checks:
Check that the Report is coherent and that information in Part A and B is consistent.
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed and no
annexes are missing.
Certificate on the Financial Statements (CFS)
The CFS is a report produced by an independent auditor (or, for public bodies, public officer)
using the template available on Portal Reference Documents. Its purpose is to give assurance
to the Granting Authority about the regularity of the costs claimed.
The thresholds depend on the EU programme and type of action (see call conditions on the
Topic page). For the MFF 2021-2027, there is usually a single threshold of EUR 325 000
requested EU contribution.
Please note that costs already audited by the Granting Authority do not have to be covered
again by the CFS (the EU contribution covered by the audit can therefore be excluded from the
calculation of the threshold).
The CFS must be uploaded as a scanned copy (PDF) together with the Financial Statement. The
originals must be kept in the your files.
Submitting the periodic reports
You should start preparing the periodic report in the Grant Management System right after the
periodic reporting is opened at the end of each reporting period (— deadline for submission is
normally 60 days).
Details on how to submit are available in the .
Make sure that the information in the Continuous Reporting Module is updated
This must be done before the Technical Report (both parts) is first Locked for review by
the Coordinator. Any entries into the Continuous Reporting Module made afterwards will
NOT be included in this periodic report.
Complete your Financial Statements
63EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Financial Statement
drafting and complete the Financial Statements for each participant on their Financial
Statement screen.
Make sure the cost details match the use of resources or detailed budget table (if required).
To sign and submit to the Coordinator, the Beneficiary’s PFSIGN must log into My Projects
> Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Sign & Submit (same procedure as for
Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant Agreement).
Affiliated Entities must supply their Beneficiary with a signed paper Financial Statement;
the Beneficiary must then fill in the information in the system and sign and submit.
If you fail to submit a Financial Statement, your costs will be considered zero for this
reporting period (but you can declare them in the next reporting period).
Upload Part B of the technical report
Upload Part B on the Technical Report Part B screen (as a single PDF). Use the template
available inside the system. This can be done by any Beneficiary (not only the Coordinator).
If any changes to Part B are needed, you must delete the pdf file and upload a new one.
When both Parts A and B are ready to submit, the Technical Report can be finalised by the
Coordinator (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Accept &
Include).
Coordinator approves Partners' financial reports
The Coordinator must review and explicitly approve the periodic report. If needed, you can
send back a Financial Statement to a Partner for further changes, or unlock the Technical
Report for editing.
Before submitting, all the accepted Partners' Financial Statements must be included (My
Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Include).
Missing statements
Sometimes you may decide to submit the report without Financial Statements from certain
Partners (e.g. if a Beneficiary cannot submit its individual Financial Statement on time). If
this happens, you will be asked to confirm that you are aware of this and that therefore
these costs will not be considered for the current payment. The participant's costs will be
considered zero for this reporting period, but they will be able to declare their costs in the
next financial report (next reporting period).
Submit the report to the Granting Authority
The Coordinator must submit all parts of the periodc report together (all the individual
Financial Statements and Part B of the Technical Report): My Projects > Actions > Manage
Project > Periodic Reporting > Submit to EU. The system will automatically generate the
report with explanations of the use of resources and the periodic Summary Financial
Statements, which includes the request for payment.
Acceptance or rejection by the Granting Authority
The Granting Authority will either:
• accept the report and start preparing the payment or
64EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• ask for changes to it — which means that the process described above starts
again.
Payment
When the Granting Authority approves the payment, the amount due will be paid out to
the Coordinator (within 90 days of receiving the report)
If the amount due is above the interim payment ceiling (90% of the maximum grant
amount), the amount due will be lowered.
The Granting Authority will send a letter to inform about the payment. After receiving the
letter, the Coordinator has 30 days to submit observations, if needed. In case of
observations, the Granting Authority will send a confirmation letter to state its final
position.
Final report
The Periodic Reporting Module (and periodic reports) are also used for the final report (report
for the last reporting period, to close the grant). The system behaviour, screens and documents
used are the same.
Beneficiary termination reporting
If one of the Beneficiaries has to leave the consortium, the the Coordinator has to prepare a
termination report (Technical Report Part B and Financial Report) and a report on the
distribution of payments to this Beneficiary in the Grant Management System.
Details on the steps to follow are explained in the .

3.3.5 Communicating your project — Acknowledgement of EU
funding
Since the EU grants are financed by public funds, EU Beneficiaries are generally expected to
actively engage in communication activities, to promote the projects and to publicly
acknowledge the EU support.
Communicating and promoting the project
65EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
What does communication involve?
The communication activities must already be part of the proposal (either as a specific work
package for communication or by including them in another work package). Communication will
be taken into consideration as part of the award criteria.
A good communication plan should define clear objectives (adapted to various relevant
target audiences) and set out a description and timing for each activity.
With your communication activities you should draw the attention (general and specialised
audiences) to the EU policy area addressed by the call.
Regarding typical communication activities (and indicators to measure them), you can refer to
the communication network indicators we use for our own communication activities.
In addition, some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) may have more targeted communication
guidance (see Horizon Europe Programme Guide).
Good communication
• Starts at the outset of the action and continues throughout its entire lifetime
• Is strategically planned and not just ad-hoc efforts
• Identifies and sets clear communication objectives (e.g. have final and intermediate
communication aims been specified? what impact is intended? what reaction or change
is expected from the target audience?)
• Is targeted and adapted to audiences that go beyond the project's own community,
including the media and the public
• Chooses relevant messages (e.g. how does the action's work relate to our everyday
lives? why does the target audience need to know about the action?)
• Uses the right medium and means (e.g. working at the right level — local, regional,
national, EU-wide; using the right ways to communicate — one-way exchange (website,
press release, brochure, etc) or two-way exchange (exhibition, school visit, internet
debate, et.); where relevant, include measures for public/societal engagement on issues
related to the action)
• Is proportionate to the scale of the action.
Acknowledgement of EU funding
Beneficiaries of EU funding must display the EU flag and funding statement (“Funded by the
European Union” or “Co-funded by the European Union”) in all their communication and
dissemination activities and any infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, supplies or major result
results funded by the grant.
The EU flag and funding statement must be displayed in a way that is easily visible for the public
and with sufficient prominence.
EU funding must moreover be acknowledged in all types of public outputs (including patent
applications, EU standardisation of results), media contacts and other public statements.
The EU flag and funding statement are available in the Grant Agreement and on the Europa
website.

• 60-minute workout webinar to increase the communication impact of your project
3.3.6 Dissemination & exploitation of project results
Since EU grants are financed by public funds, EU Beneficiaries moreover also expected to
disseminate their project results. In this way, the projects can benefit a larger group of persons
and reach wider target groups.
Several programmes will therefore ask you to upload results on dedicated results portals
(accessible through the Portal Projects & Results page).
Some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) will require more extensive dissemination and
exploitation activities (e.g. open access, exploitation obligation, etc; see Horizon Europe
Programme Guide).
In case of specific questions on intellectual property, the EU IP Helpdesk may provide support.
Links
• AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 16 and Annex 5
3.3.7 Checks, audits, reviews & investigations
In order to ensure sound financial management and compliance with the Grant Agreement
rules, the Granting Authority will perform project reviews and financial audits on participants.
For lump sum grants, since they do not use actual costs, there will be no financial audits focusing
on costs. Reviews will focus on the technical implementation of the action or other aspects of
the Grant Agreement.
Project reviews
The Granting Authority will regularly monitor the project implementation and check the proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the Grant Agreement obligations, including
assessing deliverables and reports.
In addition, the Granting Authority may also carry out in-depth project reviews. Those reviews
focus typically on the technical implementation of the project, but may also cover financial and
budgetary aspects or compliance with other obligations under the GA.
Audits
In addition, most programmes perform financial audits of participants in EU projects (often with
the help of outside audit firms).
Such audits will be performed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. The
auditors comply with ethical requirements and will plan and perform relevant procedures in line
with the EU Grants Indicative Audit Programme, in order to obtain reasonable assurance that
the Financial Statements are free of material misstatement.
You will receive a draft audit report on which you will be able to provide your observations.
If systemic errors are found, the Granting Authority may extend the findings of the audit
results to non-audited Grant Agreements or non-audited periods.
67EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Anti-fraud strategy — OLAF investigations
In case of fraud suspicions, the Granting Authority will inform the European Anti-fraud Office
(OLAF), who may conduct more in-depth investigations.
OLAF also cooperates with national authorities (through information exchange, on-the-spot
checks, coordination of forensic audits etc).
Related Certifications
Certificate on the methodology for unit cost (CoMUC)
The CoMUC is a factual report produced by an independent auditor (using the template available
on Portal Reference Documents). Its purpose is to enable the granting authority to:
• identify your usual cost accounting practices
• check that you have used a suitable unit cost accounting methodology.
Submitting a CoMUC methodology certificate is voluntary. Doing so will help prevent problems
later on, if your grant is audited. If the certificate is approved, costs declared in line with this
methodology will not be challenged, unless you have concealed information for the purpose of
the approval.
For the MFF 2021-2027, only CEF and Digital Europe will be using this certification. For Horizon
Europe it has been replaced by the SPA (systems and process audit; see AGA — Annotated
Grant Agreement, art 24).
The certificate may be requested at any time during the implementation of the programme.
As a minimum, one project should have been started and the data available must give the
auditor enough of a basis to carry out the necessary procedures. Ideally, we would recommend
submitting the methodology after at least one reporting period has passed.
In case of subsequent changes to your methodology you should notify the Granting Authority.
You may also submit a new certificate reflecting the changes.

3.3.8 Communicating with the Granting Authority
Formal notification
The formal notification channel (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) can be used ONLY for correspondence requiring
acknowledgement of receipt, i.e.
• to dispatch replies to formal notifications received from the Granting Authority
and
• for communications under Article 19 of the Grant Agreement
information requests
o
information about events and circumstances which impact the action and
o
• whenever it is clearly stipulated in the Grant Agreement (e.g. declare conflict of interest,
force majeure).
Portal Messaging Facility
The two Portal Messaging Facilities should be used for all other communications:
• Participant Register: My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation
• Grant Management System: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Process
Communications)
The Grant Management System Messaging Facility can be used only by the Coordinator.
4. Procurement
EU calls for tenders are published both on the Portal and on the TED — Tenders Electronic Daily
web site.
Currently, calls for tenders are published under the Portal Search funding & tenders page of the
Portal and the users are then redirected to the e-Tendering website for the submission of
tenders and documentation.
Read about public procurement procedures in the Portal Procurement section and the
eProcurement wiki.
5. Prizes
Prizes are also published on the Portal (Search funding & tenders page).
6. Financial instruments
Financial instruments (debt and equity instruments) are not published on the Portal, but they
are accessible via a direct link to the Europa Access to finance website, where you can locate
banks or funds which provide risk finance supported by the EU.
7. Working as an expert
69EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Introduction
The EU services managing grants and tenders frequently make use of different types of
independent experts to assist them with the implementation, evaluation and monitoring of their
funding programmes. These include:
• Evaluators
• Observers
• Ethics evaluators
• Monitors
• Ethics monitors
• business coaches
As an expert you perform this work as an independent individual and do NOT represent a
company or organisation.
The EU services recruit experts from the Portal Expert Database, where you can register at
any time. Registration is open to experts of any nationality including those outside of the EU
and Associated Countries.
To find out exactly what type of knowledge and skills we are looking for, see call for expression
of interest.
Working as an expert in short:
• Place of work: All or part of the evaluation and monitoring may be carried out at your
home or place of work (remote evaluation), or at the offices of the service concerned
(usually Brussels or Luxembourg), depending on the type of work to be done. Project
review sessions and audits, involving project representatives, may take place either at
the service’s offices or on the Beneficiaries' premises.
• Conflicts of interest: You will NOT be appointed for proposals or projects if you have
a vested interest that could influence the way you evaluate them. For more detail, please
see the section on Contracting and payments and the Model Contract for Experts.
• Confidentiality: If you are going to be handling classified information, you will need
security clearance before you can sign a contract.
• Remuneration: As an expert, you will normally receive EUR 450 for each full day
worked. However for remote evaluation and ethics review, we have developed a new
simplified methodology to calculate the amounts, please see details in the contracting
& payment section. Your travel and subsistence costs will be refunded.
• Amount of work: Projects are usually monitored and evaluated in sessions lasting 15
days a year at most. The number of proposals you assess will largely depend on the
area concerned. An independent expert may normally earn up EUR 90 000 in a four
calendar year period (counting fees only and at the current rate this equals 200 days).
In depth - working as an expert:
• How you can become an expert: start with registering as an expert
• You will be offered to sign a contract, if you are selected as an expert. To find out more

7.1 Expert registration
Registering as an expert
To work as expert, you will first need to register.
To register, go to the Experts' page on the Funding & Tenders Portal. To access the registration
forms, you'll need an EU Login account, which you can set-up on the same website if you don't
yet have one.
Once you've done this, you can log in to your account any time and view, update or complete
your profile in “My Expert Area”.
Click on the "Register as an expert" button. To create your profile, you'll need to specify:
• personal details, knowledge of languages, education and training
• area of expertise
• professional experience (employment, past involvement in EU research programmes,
publications or other achievements...)
To find out exactly what type of knowledge and skills we are looking for, see the call for
expression of interests.
Privacy
Once you have completed all sections and your profile status appears as 'valid', you become
eligible for selection for an assignment. However, registration as an expert in the database
does not guarantee automatic selection. The EU services will select experts according to their
needs of expertise.
If you are selected, you will be contacted directly by the service concerned.
Selection of experts
Experts will be selected for assignments from the database of experts who registered in My
Expert Area.
The experts will be selected for each assignment on the basis of the specific expertise needed.
For each assignment (e.g. evaluation of a call or monitoring of projects), a 'pool' of experts
is drawn-up on the basis of the following criteria:
71EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Experts have a high level of skills, experience and knowledge in the relevant
area, including project management, innovation, exploitation, dissemination
and communication. Where relevant, inter-disciplinary experts, those with
expertise in appropriate disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, as well as
gender specialists are included in the 'pool'.
• If this condition is satisfied, the 'pool' should have a balanced composition in terms
of various skills, experience and knowledge, geographical diversity and
gender. With respect to gender, the policy of the EU is one of equal opportunities for
women and men and, in this context, we have a target of 40% of the under-represented
sex in evaluation panels and expert groups.
• A private-public sector balance is assured, if appropriate.
• Experts are regularly rotated by ensuring that individual experts do not work more
than 200 days activities within consecutive 4 calendar years (EUR 90 000 EUR). With
respect to evaluations in particular, for each call, at least 25% of experts included in the
'pool' should be newcomers, i.e. not have evaluated for the call in the previous 3 years.
The 'pool' of experts is drawn-up well in advance of the assignment in question and the final
list of experts selected from the initial 'pool' is made once the precise needs in terms of expertise
are known, e.g. in the case of an evaluation, after the call deadline once the proposals are
known. Consequently, extra experts are generally included in the 'pool' to ensure the expertise
required is covered and to foresee a sufficient reserve, should some no longer be in a position
to carry out the task.
7.2 Signing a contract and payment

If you are selected as an expert, you will be offered a contract to be signed and managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. This contract (including its annexes) defines all the
rights, obligations, terms and conditions applicable to you. It is not an employment contract or
agreement.
Your contract will be based on the Model Contract for Experts. Some of the terms and conditions
in your contract will vary, depending on the type of expert activity that you are asked to carry
out. The contract will indicate
• whether or not your work will involve travel,
• the maximum number of days of work that you will be paid for and
• the planned calendar for your work.
Your correspondence with the EU services
All your correspondence with us is electronic. You should use only My Expert Area (Funding &
Tenders Portal) to communicate about your contract, e.g.
• submitting your identity/bank account details
• signing your contract (electronic-signature)
• making requests for payment and providing related supporting documents.
For any other correspondence related to your contract that the My Expert Area does not
currently support, use the email address indicated in Article 21.3 of your contract.
72EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Signing the contract
You must sign the contract online in My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal. You will
receive an email notification inviting you to do so, with a link to the contract.
The contract enters into force only once it has been signed by both parties. The contract must
be signed by both yourself and the EU service concerned by the day on which you start working
as an expert. Please do not forget to obtain permission from your employer to carry out your
expert activities if your employer requires this for outside activities – this is your responsibility.
You may start work as soon as the contract has entered into force.
If you have a contract to act as an evaluator or monitor, you will be granted access to the IT
system for the relevant proposals or project reports once the contract has entered into force.
Code of conduct
You need to adhere to the code of conduct in Annex 1 of the model contract, which includes
rules on the performance of the contract and obligations of impartiality and confidentiality.
Please carefully read Annex 1 before signing the contract.
Conflicts of interest
When contracting independent experts, the EU services ensure — to the best of their knowledge
- that you, as an expert, do not have any conflicts of interest on the activity that you are being
asked to undertake and, in particular, any proposal or project you are called upon to assess.
You should be independent, impartial and objective, and behave professionally at all times.
The contract you sign before starting work includes a declaration that you accept and will
abide by the Code of Conduct (Annex 1 of the contract). This means, amongst other things,
that
• you declare that no conflict of interest exists and
• you will inform the EU service concerned if you should discover that any such conflict
arises in the course of your duties.
• If, at the time that you sign the contract, you are already aware that you may be in a
position of conflict of interest, you are required to declare this.
Conflict of Interest impact?
To avoid situations of conflicts of interest, the EU services may withdraw experts from
evaluation or monitoring duties if it deems that this is necessary. You will be informed if this
happens to you and advised as to what to do if you need to take action.
• If you knowingly conceal a conflict of interest and this is discovered during your activities
as an expert, you will be dismissed with immediate effect, your contract will be
terminated and the measures laid down in the contract will be taken.
Example: Submitting proposals for funding while working as an expert
• If you submit a research proposal for evaluation, you are not necessarily excluded from
acting as an expert evaluator, provided that you declare it and that there is no conflict
of interest. In this case, you will not be assigned to evaluate your own proposal or any
proposals which may be competing with it.
We strongly advise you make sure that you have properly understood the provisions laid down
in the Code of Conduct, especially which situations are automatically considered to be a conflict
of interest.
Confidentiality
73EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If your role involves handling classified information, you will need security clearance before
entering into a contract.
The EU publishes an annual list of experts who have worked for us but we do not disclose who
has worked on which proposals.
Before assigning a project to you for monitoring activities, the EU services may inform the
project consortium of your name. The consortium may reject our choice of expert in the
interests of commercial confidentiality.
Payment
Requests for payment
Once your work is completed, you will receive an e-mail inviting you to submit your request
for payment through My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Travel expenses — When you claim your travel expenses, you should upload scanned copies of
all the original supporting documents as requested.
You must keep records and other supporting documents for at least two years after the payment
is made to show that you have complied in full with the terms of your contract.
Deadline — You should submit your request for payment within 30 days of receiving the email
invitation.
Bank account — You should request payment on one of the bank accounts which you have listed
in My Expert Area.
The EU services will make payments within 30 days of receiving the reports, deliverables or
completed payment requests (whichever comes latest) provided they are complete and
approved
Amount of the payment
The daily rate is EUR 450 for work including travel such as participating at evaluations,
monitoring activites or meetings at the commission or beneficiary premises. This is calculated
to the nearest half day (EUR 225) except in the following two cases:
• for remote work carried out by evaluators, any work that you are specifically asked to
carry out remotely will be paid in accordance with Article 4.1 of your contract.
• you are covered by one of the exceptional situations for which a zero fee contract must
be issued (e.g. for former EU staff in receipt of an allowance) or you requested that a
zero fee contract be issued
The contract sets out the maximum total number of days of work (and amount) that you can
be paid for. This is an upper ceiling. The actual amount that you will be paid is based on the
actual task assigned and worked; this may be less than the maximum amount.
• Please note that you will not receive payment for tasks that are not covered by the
contract (or an amendment to it) and which are not specifically assigned to you, either
via the relevant IT system, or in writing by us.
The reimbursement of travel expenses and payments of accommodation allowance and daily
allowance (see below) are made on request and in accordance with the Commission Rules on
the reimbursement of expenses of experts (see the annex of Commission Decision
C(2007)5858).
Travel expenses
74EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If your contract includes activities involving travel, expenses are refunded for this travel -
normally between the address indicated in the contract (the address registered in your expert
profile) and the meeting venue indicated in Article 3.2 of the contract. If you exceptionally need
to travel to or from a different location than the address in the contract, you need our explicit
agreement prior to purchasing your tickets.
You should book your travel as soon as possible to keep costs reasonable, but you should NOT
book your travel before your contract has been signed by both Parties.
Accommodation and daily allowances
We will also pay accommodation allowances and daily allowances:
• accommodation allowance is EUR 100 per night
• daily allowance is a flat rate of EUR 92 to cover all expenditure at the place where
the meeting/work is held, including meals and local transport (bus, tram, metro, taxi,
parking, motorway tolls, etc.) as well as travel and accident insurance
• experts who live less than 100km from the meeting venue receive a daily allowance
of EUR 46, and are not eligible to receive the accommodation allowance
• allowances may be increased for disabled experts, see below.
Other expenses
Expenses that you incur as a result of special instructions received in writing from the EU
services, different from the contract terms, may be reimbursed in justified cases on presentation
of supporting documents. Please note that no other expenses will be reimbursed.
Taxation issues
You are obliged to ensure compliance with your national legislation on taxes and social security
law – this is your responsibility. Payments you receive are NOT exempted from national taxes.
However, if you are considered to supply a taxable service under national tax law and you are
registered for VAT as a natural person in an EU Member State, you can benefit from a VAT
exemption certificate for EU payments made under your contract.
Please note that in this case your invoice needs to bear a special indication “VAT exemption
/ European Union / Article 151 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC” (specific incidations are
mandatory for some countries, like Belgium, Luxembourg or Italy).
Further information on the VAT situation can be found in the FAQs on the Funding & Tenders
Portal.
Disabilities
If an expert's disability requires that a person accompany them when travelling, then the
travel expenses of that person will also be refunded upon prior request. The EU services will
also pay accommodation allowances and daily allowances to the accompanying person.
Keeping supporting documents:
You must keep records or other supporting documents for two years from the date of the
last payment made under the contract that the work relates to, when you work as an expert.
The EU services may ask you to provide these documents as evidence that the contract was
carried out correctly and that any expenses claimed are genuine.
75EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
7.3 Experts roles and tasks
If you have registered as an expert and have the required profile, the EU service will contact
you in due course to let you know whether you have been selected. This depends on whether
there are any proposals to be evaluated or projects to be monitored requiring your
particular expertise.
Roles and tasks assigned to experts
As an expert, you can perform a variety of roles and tasks:
1. Evaluators are responsible for evaluating proposals submitted in response to a call for
proposals.
Evaluators may also act as a rapporteur, chair, or vice-chair at consensus discussions
or meetings of panels of evaluators. Rapporteurs are responsible for drafting the
consensus report (CR) of a consensus meeting.
2. Observers provide the EU services with independent advice on the conduct and fairness
of all phases of the evaluation process, on how evaluators apply award criteria, and on
how to improve the procedure.
The observer may attend any meeting held during the proposal evaluation process and
drafts a report on the evaluation session observed.
3. Monitors assist EU services in monitoring the implementation of projects that have
received funding, taking into account work descriptions, reports and deliverables.
All experts' tasks are laid down in their contract and its annexes. See the Model Contract for
Experts for further details.
Proposal-evaluation process
The underlying principles to bear in mind during evaluation are:
• Excellence - projects must demonstrate a high level of quality in relation to the topics
and criteria set out in the calls
• Transparency - funding decisions must be based on clearly defined rules and
procedures, and applicants should receive adequate feedback on the outcome of the
evaluation
• Fairness and impartiality - all proposals must be treated equally and evaluated
impartially on their merits, irrespective of their origin or the identity of the applicants
• Confidentiality - all proposals and related data, knowledge and documents must be
treated in confidence
• Speed and efficiency - proposals should be evaluated and grants awarded and
administered as swiftly as possible, without compromising quality or breaking the rules
Award criteria
The award criteria to be applied by the evaluators are set for each programme in the call
conditions .
Thresholds may vary according to the work programme. For two-stage submission schemes,
thresholds and the maximum overall score may vary between the first and the second stage.
76EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Steps in the Process
The diagram below depicts the main steps of the evaluation process and highlights at which
stages the experts intervene
There are three main phases in the experts' involvement in the evaluation process.
Before starting their work, experts are briefed on evaluation procedures (including remote
evaluation), the topics of the relevant calls for proposals and the terms of their contracts. This
briefing can be done in Brussels or remotely (e.g. web-streaming).
For each proposal, experts presents their evaluation results in an individual evaluation
report (IER), explaining the evaluation scores. Expert evaluators also pre-screen each
proposal (on the basis of the applicant's ethics self-assessment) to see if it raises ethical
issues. All evaluation forms are completed online. This report can be completed and
signed remotely or in Brussels.
In principle, proposals will be evaluated initially by at least three experts (in a number of
cases, five or more). However, for the first stage in two-stage submission schemes and
for low-value grants, only two experts may be involved.
A consensus group is convened in order for all the experts who assessed the proposals
in question to discuss the individual evaluation reports and agree on comments and
scores.
The consensus group discussion is led by a moderator (normally an official from the
concerned EU service), who seeks a consensus and ensures that proposals are evaluated
in a fair manner and in line with the established criteria.
The consensus group discussion results in a consensus report (CR) including
justifications of scores and dissenting views, if any. The moderator is responsible for
ensuring that the consensus report reflects the consensus reached. The report is signed
by the rapporteur and the experts evaluating the proposal discussed.
The discussion usually takes place in Brussels and includes experts who participated in
the individual evaluation. It is also possible to convene a remote consensus group.
Panel review consists of reviewing all the proposals within a call, or part of a call, to:
• ensure that the consensus groups have been consistent in their evaluations;
77EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• if necessary, propose a new set of marks or comments; and
• resolve cases where a consensus could not be reached and a minority view was
recorded in the consensus report.
Exceptionally, in some cases, justified by the specific call circumstances, the outcome of
the consensus group will constitute the final result of the evaluation, and there will be no
panel review. These cases will be signalled in the guidance documents.
The panel review is led by a panel chairperson (normally an official from the concerned
EU service) who ensures fair and equal treatment of the proposals.
The panel review should result in a panel report which includes the evaluation
summary report (ESR) for each proposal, a list of proposals passing all thresholds,
along with a final score, (panel ranked list) and, where necessary, the panel's
recommendations for priority order in the event of equal scores, using the procedure set
out in the work programme. A rapporteur may be appointed to draft the panel report.
Monitoring projects (Technical review)
Projects are monitored to assess the work carried out over a given period and make
recommendations to the EU services. Monitoring may cover scientific, technological and other
aspects of the implementation of the project and Grant Agreement.
The monitoring expert's task is to advise the EU services on how the project has progressed
with regard to:
• the initial work plan
• deliverables
• planned and used resources
• relevance of the objectives
• scientific and industrial quality
• management procedures and methods
• Beneficiaries' contributions, and
• the expected potential impact in scientific, technological, economic, competitive and
social terms, and the plans for the use and dissemination of results.
Depending on the project's complexity and progress, the review may include remote work
entailing reading and analysis of the Grant Agreement, grant decision and other background
information and deliverables and finally drafting the report. The expert may also be required to
attend project meetings at the EU services offices or at the premises of the Beneficiary.
The EU services may require the expert to carry out on-site technical audits to verify whether
critical milestones are being met, or to assist in carrying out research integrity (scientific
misconduct) analysis during implementation.
Types of project monitoring
• Periodic monitoring provided for in the Grant Agreement (generally linked to payment)
• Ad-hoc monitoring, which the EU services can request at any time, where necessary,
and which may involve reviewing financial and technical aspects, or only technical
aspects.
78EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Monitoring process
• Review meeting and assessment - experts read all relevant documents before and
attends the review meeting. They then assess the project on the basis of the written
material and information provided at the meeting. In the event of remote monitoring,
the assessment is based on written documents only.
• Monitoring report - the expert draws up the monitoring report on a project, and the
EU service sends it to the consortium via the Coordinator, but it is not made public. If
more than one expert is involved in project monitoring, they issue a single consolidated
report written by a rapporteur.
• Recommendations - the monitor will also assist the EU services by recommending any
changes that may be required. However, the final decision on recommendations and
changes is taken by the EU services alone.
• Observations - Beneficiaries may comment on the monitoring report within one month
of receiving it.
• Project assessment by the EU services? - taking the experts' formal
recommendations into account, the EU services informs the Coordinator of its decision,
which, however, may depart from the recommendations. It may entail
accepting or rejecting the deliverables
o
allowing the project to continue in its existing form
o
suggesting modifications, or
o
taking steps to terminate the Grant Agreement or to exclude a Beneficiary from
o
taking part.

1. Introduction
In order to receive EU funding/tenders (i.e. grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc), applicants need to fulfill a certain number of conditions
which must be checked before any funding can be awarded to them.
Some of these checks are done centrally by the EU Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register, set up in accordance with
Articles 128 and 147 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/10461 as central repository
and electronic data interchange area for participants.
This guidance sets out the rules that the Central Validation Service will use for these
checks. They currently cover:
− legal entity validation (also called ‘PIC validation’)
− LEAR appointment
− collecting the financial information for the financial capacity assessment (also
called ‘FCA’)
− ownership control assessment (also called ‘OCA’).
For these checks, the participants will be contacted directly by the Central Validation
Service and asked to submit the necessary information and supporting documents via
the Participant Register. This happens normally during preparation of the first grant,
procurement, prize or contribution agreement that successfully passed the evaluation
stage, but can also occur later during subsequent applications or in case of changes.
All data and documents will be treated as confidential.
Personal data will be handled in accordance with Regulation 2018/17252 to ensure
compliance with the principles of transparency, proportionality, impartiality and
legality. For the details, please refer to the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy
Statement (available on Portal > Legal Notices).
2. Legal entity validation
2.1. Legal entity validation and specific legal statuses: Criteria and
conditions
One of the main tasks of the Central Validation Service is the validation of new legal
entities applying for EU grants, procurements, prizes and contribution agreements.
Legal entity validation is a requirement under the Financial Regulation. It serves to
ensure that only verified entities can enter into financial relations with the EU and to
avoid legally invalid contracts.
Legal entity validation is needed only once, to get the legal entity information and

the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No

participant identification code (PIC) validated. Once validated, the participants can
enter into financial relations with the EU and use the PIC for all EU actions managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. The PIC will be valid for all ongoing application
procedures and signature in the system, but also for any type of EU funding in the
future — without having to re-register or be re-validated.
This is why the standards for PIC validation are applied consistently, independently of
the specific call/application/tender procedure that triggers the validation. The same
criteria and checks are applied for grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc, as well as for low and high value contracts.
The validation comprises two distinct actions: (a) the verification that the participant
exists as legal entity capable of entering into financial relations with the EU, including
correctness of the participant’s legal data (legal form, address, etc) and (b) the
verification of certain specific legal statuses that are used in EU funding programmes
and recorded centrally in the Participant Register.
2.1.1 Legal entity validation
‘Legal entity’ means a natural person or an entity created and recognised by law as a
legal person. It must have legal personality and, acting on its own account and in its
own name, be able to exercise rights and be subject to obligations.
Specific cases
❖ Natural persons (including self-employed persons; see below) — Are by default
considered as being legal entities. However, the Central Validation Service will refuse
validation of persons that cannot legally enter into contractual relations with the EU
(e.g. persons under age).
❖ Branches — Are not regarded as legal entities, since they do not have legal
personality distinct from that of their mother-company. The fact that they are
registered in national official registers is not relevant. It will be their mother-company
that will be considered as legal entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in
the Participant Register. The same applies to branches established in a different
country or branches of entities such as non-profit organisations, NGOs, etc.
❖ Foreign companies (company establishments which are registered with a special
status in the official register, e.g. ‘société de droit étranger’) — Will not be regarded
as legal entities, since they do not have legal personality distinct from that of their
mother-company. It will be their mother-company that will be considered as legal
entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register (the
one registered in the country of incorporation).
❖ Entities set-up within (or under) a parent organisation (such as
departments/centers/offices, without legal personality, despite having administrative
or budgetary autonomy, own VAT number/fiscal code/number of registration, etc) —
Cannot be regarded as legal entities and are considered as belonging to their parent-
organisation. It will be their parent organisation that will be considered as legal entity
for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register.
2.1.2 Exception: Validation of private entities without legal personality
By way of exception, the Financial Regulation allows for certain ‘entities without legal
personality’ to be eligible for EU grants. Such entities can therefore be validated in
the Participant Register, provided they meet the conditions set out in Article
197(2)(c) of this Regulation:
7EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on behalf
of the entity
and
− the entity offers equivalent guarantees for the protection of the EU financial
interests as a legal person, in particular equivalent financial and operational
capacity (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
This exception aims at private entities, i.e. associations or similar entities with
permanent structures (secretariat, management board, assembly, etc.) that have
their own activities, but just lack formal legal personality.
Concerning the first condition, the entity must prove its representatives' capacity to
undertake legal obligations on its behalf. This condition is not met when the
obligations are assumed on behalf of the representatives themselves or on behalf of
the owner(s) of the entity.
Concerning the second condition, the entity must prove the following elements:
− existence of patrimony/assets/capital separated and different from those of its
members/owners
and
− rules ensuring that creditors can rely on such patrimony/assets/capital and
that, in case of liquidation/insolvency, creditors are reimbursed prior to the
repartition of the patrimony/assets/capital among the owners/members (—
both conditions must be fulfilled and proved by supporting documents).
This exception only applies for participation in EU grants; entities without legal
personality cannot participate in EU tenders.
2.1.3 Exception: Validation of ministries, specialised entities of IOs and
certain EU bodies
By way of exception, the Central Validation Service will also accept the following
public entities without legal personality to be validated in the Participant Register:
− the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) (explicitly declared eligible by Articles
176(2) and 197(4) of the Financial Regulation)
− ministries, executive services which are part of the public administration of a
(central or federated) State and directly linked to the government and other
services which are part of the legislative or judicial administration, in
accordance with the official organisation of the State
− assimilated international organisations referred to in Article 156(2) of the
Financial Regulation
− specialised entities set up by international organisations, that lack legal
personality
− Common Foreign Security Policy (CFSP) missions and EU special
representatives set up by the Council of the European Union.
Departments/directorates/units/offices and other entities set up within a Ministry (or
within an executive or other service) without legal personality are considered as part
of the same Ministry (or service) and cannot be considered as independent legal
8EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
entities (e.g. schools, libraries, etc). They will have to use the PIC of their parent
organisation to participate in EU grants, procurements, prizes, etc.
2.1.4 Specific legal statuses
In addition, the validation covers the following specific legal statuses that are used in
certain EU funding programmes:
− private entity or public body
− non-profit or for profit organisation
− small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
− middle-capitalisation enterprise (mid-cap)
− non-governmental organisation (NGO)
− civil society organisation (CSO)
− international organisation (IO)
− research organisation
− secondary or higher education establishment.
An entity may be categorised in more than one of these legal statuses (i.e. non-profit,
public body, research organisation, international organisation, etc.).
The practical relevance of these statuses (and what happens if they change) is
established at the level of the different funding programmes, and sometimes even at
the level of the call for proposals/call for tender.
Moreover, not all of these statuses are systematically checked and validated by the
Central Validation Service. Some of them are self-declarations or self-assessments.
This means that the participants are solely responsible for the correctness of the
information they provide (in the self-declaration/self-assessment).
The Central Validation Service may however — at any time — carry out checks on
self-declared/self-assessed statuses against supporting documents and ask for
clarifications.
In case of false declarations, the EU services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status(es)
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements,
etc.; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
Private entity or public body
'Private entity' means an entity established under private law.
‘Public body’ means an entity established as a public body by national law, or an
9EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
international organisation.
‘Established as a public body by national law’ means:
− incorporated as a public body in the act of creation or recognised as a public
body by national law
and
− governed by public law (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
Criteria such as:
− mission or activity in the general interest (public service mission)
− the fact that the shares are owned by a public body (even if ownership reaches
up to 100% of the share capital)
− public financing
− state supervision and control
do NOT constitute sufficient evidence to qualify an entity as a public body, if the
above two conditions are not met.
Public bodies may however act and be subject to private law for some or most of their
activities, provided that, concerning their existence and their functioning, they are
subject to public law.
The two statuses (private entity and public body) are mutually exclusive, meaning
that you can only be validated as one or the other.
They are systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the
Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Self-employed persons (persons who perform an activity independently and with
their own means, such as craftsmen and individuals exercising liberal, industrial and
commercial professions) — Are regarded as ‘natural persons’, not as ‘private entities’;
the business/profession/activity they perform is not provided with independent legal
personality different from that of the person.
❖ Private law bodies with a public service mission3 — A legal entity
incorporated under private law/private legal form is not considered to be a public
body even if owned by the State/other public bodies and/or pursuing a public service
mission.
Non-profit
‘Non-profit entity’ means an entity that is non-profit making by its legal form or legal
purpose (e.g. charitable organisations), or that has a legal or statutory obligation not
to distribute profits to its shareholders or members.
All profits have to be reinvested in the same activity of the entity.
3 Article 62(1)(c)(vi) of Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
10EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Decisions on (not) distributing profits made by the managing board, associates,
stakeholders, members, or representatives and/or practices adopted by the entity to
not distribute profits and/or the absence of profits achieved are not sufficient proof of
the non-profit nature. The obligation not to distribute profits and/or the impossibility
to distribute profits must be based on law and/or the act of establishment/articles of
association/statutes, etc.
Whether the owners/founders of the entity are non-profit and whether the profits are
allocated to non-profit (or for profit) entities is irrelevant.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Public bodies — Are in principle regarded as non-profit by default.
❖ Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) — The classification as ‘non-
governmental organisation (NGO)’ is not relevant for the non-profit status, since in
most countries NGO is not a recognized legal form. By contrast, non-profit status is a
prerequisite for the self-declaration as NGO (see below).
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
‘Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)’ means a micro, small or medium-sized
enterprise as defined in the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361, i.e.:
− engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form (including, in
particular, self-employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or
other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an
economic activity)
and
− employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as
defined in Article 5 of the SME Recommendation) and which have an annual
turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and/or an annual balance sheet total
not exceeding EUR 43 million.4
An entity is considered to be engaged in an ‘economic activity’, if it proves to be
involved in any form of trade or activity done for remuneration or pecuniary interest
on the market. Thus, in general, any activity consisting in (directly or indirectly)
offering goods or services on a given market is an economic activity.
The following will NOT be considered economic activities:
− activities which do not entail (directly or indirectly) some sort of pecuniary
offset or
− activities for which there is no given/direct (or indirect) market or
− activities for which the income generated is not distinct from the personal
income of the entity’s members or shareholders.
4 The SME ceilings must be calculated by including the headcount of staff, the balance sheet total and the
turnover data of all relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361.
11EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
This status is self-declared. For calls where the SME status has an impact on eligibility
or funding (higher funding rate, etc), participants must go through a self-assessment
wizard.
Two-year rule — In accordance with Article 4.2 of the SME Recommendation, the SME
status depends on the ceilings for two consecutive accounting periods. Headcount and
turnover must stay below the ceilings for two accounting periods to obtain the SME
status; conversely, the status will be lost if they rise above the ceilings for two
consecutive periods.
Since the SME self-assessment looks at the information for only one accounting
period (the last one), the SME self-assessment result may be flawed. Participants that
were below the ceiling the year before, must contact the Central Validation Service
via the Participant Register in order to request a formal validation. This validation will
then take into account the two accounting periods.
The two-year rule does not apply for changes due to a merger or acquisition.
Enterprises that are subject to a change in ownership need to be assessed on the
basis of their shareholder structure at the time of the transaction. If the aggregated
headcount and financial data of the new structure exceed the SME ceilings, the SME
status is lost immediately from the date of the transaction5.
Participants whose SME status changes after registration must update their data in
the Participant Register. This is important not only for eligibility checks in grant
applications, but also for statistical purposes.
Specific cases
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that do not yet have
closed accounts or companies without economic activity but expecting to enter
soon into the market — May also qualify as SMEs, as long as they are able to provide
a ‘bona fide estimate’ (in the form of a business plan) covering the period necessary
for the entity to generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long time-to market
— Are allowed to demonstrate that they are engaged in an economic activity by
showing the investments made and the likely expected return.
Middle-capitalisation enterprise (Mid-cap)
'Middle-capitalisation enterprise’ means an enterprise that is:
− not a micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under the EU SME
Recommendation 2003/361
and
− employing up to 3 000 persons6 , where the headcount of staff, including all
relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises, is calculated in
accordance with Article 3 to 6 of the Annex to the Recommendation.
This status is self-declared. For calls where the mid-cap status has an impact on
eligibility or funding (higher funding rate, etc.), participants must go through the SME
5 See Recital 9 of Recommendation No, 2003/361/EC and the User Guide to the SME Definition (p. 14).
6 Expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Annex of EU recommendation
2003/361.
12EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
self-assessment wizard to make sure that they do not fall under the definition of SME,
and then to self-declare that the number of employees does not exceed 3 000
persons.
Non-governmental organisation (NGO)
‘Non-governmental organisations’ are organisations which are voluntary, independent
from government and non-profit, and which are not a political party or trade union.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by private entities,
which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Civil society organisation (CSO)
‘Civil society organisations’ are organisations from the ‘third sector’ of society, distinct
from government and business (i.e. private for profit entities).
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will normally be accepted only by private
entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
International organisation (IO)
‘International organisation’ means an intergovernmental organisation (other than the
EU) established under international public law, including specialised entities — with or
without legal personality — set up by international organisations.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
For some EU funding programmes there are moreover specific subtypes of
international organisations:
− ‘international organisations of European interest for H2020 (H2020 IOEI)’, i.e.
international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member
States or H2020 associated countries and whose main objective is promoting
scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international European research organisations for Horizon Europe (HE IERO)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries and whose main
objective is promoting scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international organisations of European interest for Digital Europe (DEP IOEI)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or whose headquarters are in an EU Member State.
The H2020 IOEI subtype status is systematically checked against supporting
documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.
The HE IERO and DEP IOEI subtype statuses are self-declared. In the future, for calls
where the HE IERO and DEP IOEI statuses have an impact on eligibility or funding,
participants will also be asked to go through a self-assessment wizard.
Specific cases
❖ Entities set up as distinct bodies by an international organisation with a
special mission but which do not have explicit legal personality — Can be validated
as with legal personality, if they meet any of the following criteria:
− they have treaty-making capacity or
13EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− they have capacity to act at international level independently from the
organisation that set them up (i.e. capacity to undertake legal obligations).
If such entities do not meet one of the above criteria, they can exceptionally be
validated as without legal personality (see section 2.1.3 above).
Research organisation
‘Research organisation’ means an entity that:
− is established as non-profit organisation as described above
and
− carries out research and/or technological development as its main objective.
The following are NOT considered research activities:
− supporting or financing research activities carried out by other entities
− promoting, managing or coordinating research activities.
Only entities that have research and/or development as their main objective can
qualify as research organisations. By contrast, entities that have research and/or
development as ancillary activities (even if regular and substantial, e.g. in museums
or hospitals) do not qualify as ‘research organisations’.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by entities, which
have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Secondary or higher education establishment
‘Secondary or higher education establishment’ means an entity that is recognised as
such by its national education system and is able to deliver diplomas recognised by
the State.
It can be a public body or a private entity (see above). The national accreditation as a
secondary/higher education establishment is not sufficient to consider the entity as a
public body.
This status is self-declared.
2.2 Documents and information to provide
2.2.1 General requirements and principles
The legal validation of entities is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participants as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
by the participants on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (can be
required by the EU services at any time).
In principle only official documents are accepted. Documents are considered as official
when they are delivered by official national authorities. Official documents can NOT be
replaced by self-declarations or by sworn or solemn statements before judicial or
administrative authorities, notaries or public officers.
As a general rule, documents are accepted in any of the EU official languages.
Participants may however be requested to submit an English free (unofficial)
translation to facilitate the validation process. Documents in non-EU languages will be
accepted only if accompanied by a free translation in English (and in case of doubt, a
14EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
certified/legal translation in English may be requested). Free translations should
always be accompanied by the copies of the original official documents.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as for any information provided by other means
(e.g. by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
2.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Signed legal entity identification form7:
− Natural Person Form: in English
− Private Legal Entity Form: in English
− Public Legal Entity Form: in English.
2. Official VAT document or — if the entity is not registered for VAT — the proof of
VAT exemption, not older than one (1) year.
For the specific legal statuses, participants will be asked to submit the following
additional documents:
Status Documents to be submitted
Private entity A valid registration extract not older than one (1) year.
Documents older than one year may be accepted if valid for a
(including SME and mid-cap)
certain period of time expressly indicated in the same
document (e.g. valid for two years) and if submitted via the
Participant Register within this period of time.
Public body Copy of the act, law, decree or decision that established the
entity as a public body (or, if this does not exist, any other
official legal document that proves this).
Natural person Integral copy (legible) of valid identity card or passport (e.g. in
case of identity card, both sides must be provided).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Entities without legal personality Copy of an official document attesting that the representatives
of the entity have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on
its behalf.
Copy of an official document attesting that the entity has the
same operational and financial viability as that of a legal entity:
i.e.
1. a document showing patrimony/assets/capital that
are separated and different from those of the
members/owners of the entity, and
2. a copy of the rules providing that creditors can rely
on this patrimony/assets/capital and — in case of
liquidation/insolvency — are reimbursed before the
patrimony/assets/capital are divided between the
owners/members.
Non-profit Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is non-
profit by its legal form or by its legal purpose, or that it has a
legal or statutory obligation not to distribute profits to
shareholders or individual members.
The certificate of tax exemption is only an indication of the
non-profit status and will therefore be assessed together with
other elements.
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME) The following documents must be provided for the participant
and mid-caps and for its linked and partner entities (in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation
(— if expressly requested by the Central
2003/361):
Validation Service)
1. graph showing the complete ownership structure,
including all direct and indirect shareholders
2. proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners
and their respective percentage of interest and voting
rights
3. approved financial statements for the most recent
closed accounting period, including:
− balance sheet statement
− profit and loss account, clearly indicating the
amount of annual turnover from sales of goods
and services
− annexes to these documents and/or
accompanying notes, indicating (i) staff head
count and (ii) any equity participations in other
companies/downstream organisations with
exact percentage of the shares and voting rights
held. If the annexes/notes to the financial
statements do not contain the requested
information, other documents can be provided
that contain equivalent data (such as headcount
reports for social security purposes, extracts from
HR records certifying headcount, etc); in
exceptional cases, self-declarations can be
accepted
4. documents explaining the mechanisms of ownership
and control, corporate governance and decision-
making rules (e.g. statutes/articles of association and
shareholders’ agreements; memorandum of
16EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
understanding among shareholders, internal corporate
governance rules, etc)
Sworn or solemn statements before a judicial or
administrative authority, notary or public officer cannot replace
the above listed documents as proof of the SME or mid-cap
status.
The following documents must be submitted in the below
specific cases:
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that
do not yet have closed accounts — Instead of approved
financial statements, a self-declaration must be provided,
including a bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan)
for the entire period (financial years) necessary for the entity to
generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long
time-to market — In addition to the approved financial
statements, a self-declaration must be provided, including a
bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan) for the
entire period (financial years) necessary to generate turnover,
including a declaration of the investment made and the likely
expected return (to demonstrate that, despite the lack of
turnover, the enterprise is engaged in an economic activity).
❖ Entities owned directly or indirectly by natural persons —
Self-declaration on the natural person(s) engagement in
economic activity and possible participations in other entities
must be provided. The template for the self-declaration will be
provided to participants during the validation process if specific
cases of ownership by natural persons are identified.
International organisation Copy of the international treaty creating the organisation under
international public law.
Research organisation Copy of an official document attesting research or technological
development as the main objective of the entity.
(— if expressly requested by the Central
Validation Service)
Secondary or higher education Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is
establishment recognised as ‘secondary or higher education establishment’ by
the national education system and is entitled to deliver
(— if expressly requested by the Central
diplomas recognized by the State.
Validation Service)
For other categories such as NGO, Civil Society Organisation, etc no supporting
documents are needed (unless exceptionally requested by the Central Validation
Service).
2.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
17EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− the documents submitted are outdated (e.g. VAT document or extract of
registration no longer valid or more than one (1) year old)
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the validation (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
2.3 Validation and effective date
On the basis of the submitted information and documents, the participant will be
validated with the effective date of entry into force of the legal act establishing its
constitution or incorporation (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
That date will be, in order of precedence:
1. the date of registration in the country's’official registry (e.g. commercial
registry)
2. the date of publication in the national official journal
3. the date of the legal deposit of the act in the court registry
4. the date of signature of the parties.
When there is no act of constitution or incorporation, the participant will be
considered to exist since a standard default date.
The effective date for the SME and mid-cap status will be the accounts closure date of
the accounting period on which the assessment is based in accordance with Article
4(2) of the Annex of the SME Recommendation 2003/361. For newly established
enterprises that do not yet have closed accounts, the effective date is the date of
their creation.
The effective date of other specific legal statuses is the date in which the specific
status enters into force. This date may be the same as its effective date of
constitution or incorporation (or may differ, if the specific status has been acquired
later on).
2.4 Modification of validations
Modifications in the validation can be made in the following cases:
− following a request submitted by the participant to update the validation (e.g.
in case of changes in the participant’s legal situation such as change of
identity/legal form, name, address, status) or
− after checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out by the EU services
which necessitate a correction.
2.4.1 Validation updates
In case of a change in the participant’s legal situation (identity/legal form, name,
address, status, etc), the participant must request an update of the validation.
18EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Requests to update a validation will be accepted, if submitted by the participant’s
LEAR and accompanied by the relevant supporting documents. If no LEAR has
been appointed yet in the Participant Register, requests for modification should be
submitted after the LEAR appointment has been validated.
The ‘effective date of the change’ will be the date on which the act establishing the
change enters into force (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
For SMEs and mid-caps, the effective date is the closure date of the accounting period
on which the change of status is based. For cases of mergers and acquisitions that
lead to the loss of the SME or mid-cap status, the effective date of change will be the
date when the ownership structure changed.
The impact and practical consequences of the changes depend on each funding
programme.
2.4.2 Corrections of validations
If a validation turns out to beincorrect (through an audit, ex-post check, investigation
or other means), it will be corrected by the Central Validation Service. The correction
will be registered with effect back to the effective date of the initial validation.
If the error is attributable to the Central Validation Service and its correction implies
disadvantages for the participant, the retroactive effect may exceptionally be waived,
if duly justified and in line with the principles of sound financial management and
proportionality.
If the error was the fault of the participant (intentional or unintentional), its
participation in on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc
may be terminated and undue amounts paid may be recovered. Moreover, the
participant may be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements,
prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial
Regulation). In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
2.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If they find out that a participant did not meet the criteria for being validated or for
being validated with a specific legal status (e.g. due to false declarations), the
modification of the validation will be registered with retroactive effect back to the
effective date of the validation.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc, their participation may be terminated/withdrawn and
undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.

3. Validation of the LEAR appointment
3.1 Validation of the LEAR appointment: General requirements and principles
In parallel with the legal entity validation, the Central Validation Service will contact
the participants to appoint their Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR), i.e.
the single point of contact needed for the Participant Register and Funding & Tenders
Portal electronic exchange system.
The appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register is mandatory for all
validated participants. Without LEAR it will NOT be possible to update the legal entity
data in the Participant Register, nor sign contracts electronically in the Funding &
Tenders Portal.
3.1.1 Role of the LEAR
The LEAR is the person officially appointed by the participant to handle their access
rights and key data in the Participant Register (legal and other data, certain access
rights in the electronic exchange system, etc.).
Once validated, it is the LEAR who is responsible for giving access rights to the Portal
electronic exchange system and who must ensure that the participant’s legal
information is always up to date.
The LEAR must enter and update on the ‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen the names
of the:
− legal representatives and signatories for the organisation (so-called ‘LSIGNs’);
these are people who are able to commit the organisation legally by signing
contracts and authorising amendments to them and
− persons that may sign cost statements on behalf of the organisation (so-called
‘FSIGNs’).
If needed, the LEARs can delegate their tasks to one or more colleagues, who will act
as account administrators (so-called ‘AccAds’; delegation also through the
‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen).
In case of changes, the LEAR must encode the change in the Participant Register and,
if needed, request validation and provide supporting documents.
For a detailed description of the LEAR rights and responsibilities, see the LEAR
appointment letter*.
3.1.2 Position of the LEAR
The LEAR is an administrative function that may be held by the participant’s legal
representative or another key person within the entity.
The LEAR must be someone employed in the entity (most commonly in the central
administrative services of the entity) and should be able to ensure the stability and
continuity that is needed to fulfil this role in order to honour the participant’s
contractual obligations.
Participants that are natural persons will automatically have the role of LEAR; in this
case the role cannot be attributed to a different person (but the LEAR can appoint an
account administrator).
20EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Each participant can only appoint one LEAR and must ensure to immediately replace
their LEAR in case they are no longer able to exercise the role (e.g. job change,
dismissal, death, etc; see section 3.3).
The participant assumes the full responsibility for the choice of the person they
appoint as LEAR.
3.1.3 Legal representative
The LEAR must be appointed by the participant’s legal representative. The legal
representative is a person duly authorised to act on behalf of the entity and to
commit it in its entirety vis-à-vis third parties.
Specific cases
❖ Persons tasked with the daily management — Can not be recognized as legal
representatives if they are not entitled to engage and represent the entity outside
ordinary day-to-day business matters.
The ‘daily management’ (‘gestion journalière’) is commonly understood as comprising
those acts that, because of their minor importance or the need for a prompt solution,
do not justify the intervention of the management bodies. It consists of ordinary
business and execution of day-to-day decisions and in line with the general
instructions of the management board.
❖ Limitations — Similarly, persons empowered to engage and commit the
participant only within certain limits (including financial limits) can not be accepted as
legal representatives for the purposes of the LEAR appointment.
3.1.4 Timing of the LEAR appointment
The process for appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register can run in parallel
to the validation of the entity, but can only be finalised once the participant (PIC) is
validated.
LEAR appointment is not a condition for the submission of a proposal/tender in the
Funding & Tenders Portal, but its validation must be completed before the the grant,
procurement or contribution agreement can be signed.
3.2 List of documents and information
For the validation of the LEAR appointment, the scanned version of the following
documents must be uploaded by the participant in the Participant Register:
1. LEAR appointment letter* (specifying the LEAR roles & duties and including the
declaration of consent to the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and
Conditions*), completed, dated and signed by the legal representative and the
LEAR
2. Integral copy of an official, valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport, with
photo and signature) of:
− the legal representative and
− the appointed representative (LEAR)
3. Document(s) proving that the legal representative(s) appointing the LEAR is
empowered as such, which must:
21EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− clearly indicate the role/function within the organisation as legal
representative
− identify and appoint this person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
The originals must be kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which
can be required by the EU services at any time). They must not be sent to the Central
Validation Service.
After receiving the above-listed documents (and after the PIC has been validated),
the LEAR appointment will be validated in the Participant Register.
For a detailed description of the LEAR appointment process, see the Online Manual*
and the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions*.
Proof of identity
‘Identity documents’ are those issued by national authorities and recognized by
national law as valid proof of identity. Identity documents can not be replaced by any
other means of proof. The EU services cannot waive this requirement under any
circumstances.
Examples of identity documents accepted are ID cards and passports. Driving licenses
are also accepted, as long as they are considered as valid proof of identity under the
applicable national law of the entity concerned.
Identity documents must be valid (not expired) at the time of the LEAR appointment.
An integral copy of the document must be provided (e.g. in most countries both sides
of the identity card must be provided).
Identity documents in which some parts/elements, including the photo, have been
deleted/erased/covered (e.g. with black marker) cannot be accepted.
Specific cases
❖ Service cards and badges issued by the participant — Cannot replace identity
documents (even if the participant is a public body) and therefore cannot be accepted
as proof of identity.
❖ Print-outs from the ID electronic chip — Cannot be accepted either.
Signatures
The LEAR documents must be signed by persons who are legal representatives of the
participant.
The names of both legal representative and LEAR in the LEAR documents must
correspond to those indicated in their official identity documents. LEAR documents
signed with acronyms/nick names/etc that do not correspond to the names indicated
in the identity documents will not be accepted.
Signatures can be either handwritten signatures or qualified electronic signatures
22EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
within the meaning of Article 3(12) of Regulation 910/20148. For the latter, the
Central Validation Service will verify that the signature is based on a valid qualified
certificate and was created by a secure creation device. See here for the list of
accepted trust service providers: eIDAS Dashboard (europa.eu).
Specific cases
❖ Internal requirements (e.g. joint signature of more than one person required to
legally engage the entity, foreseen by law, act of establishment, statutes, internal
rules, etc) — In case of internal requirements, the participant is fully responsible for
ensuring compliance (e.g. through an internal process ensuring that the single
signature on the LEAR documents is made only after all the internal requirements on
joint signature are fulfilled).
❖ Limitations — The Central Validation Service will take into account limitations to
represent the entity only if these limitations are explicitly mentioned in the
documents submitted to prove the empowerment of the legal representative (e.g.
limitation in the excerpts of the company registry).
Documents proving the empowerment of the legal representative
The document(s) proving the empowerment must identify:
− the role/function of legal representative within the entity
− the name and appointment of the person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
This can be found in a single document (in case the official appointment also specifies
the powers/tasks related to the appointment) or in several documents combined (e.g.
the official act of appointment and the organisational document, such as act of
establishment, statutes, articles of association, etc, in which the powers/tasks related
to the role are identified).
The documents must be valid (not expired) at the time when the LEAR is appointed.
The documents proving the appointment of the legal representative are those
required/accepted under the applicable national law of the entity concerned. They
may vary depending on the country, the legal form and status:
− law/decree/official act/official gazette in case of public entities
− copy of the treaty in case of international organisations
− decision of assembly, official documents from the council of administration,
executive committee or directors board, excerpts of the company registry in
case of private entities.
A declaration of honour can be accepted only in exceptional, duly justified cases
where none of the above exists.
Concerning the language of such documents and participant's responsibilities
concerning translations, see section 2.2.1.
8 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on
electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 257,
28.8.2014, p. 73).
23EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Specific cases
❖ Participants who are natural persons — Do not need to prove their
empowerment, but still need to send the supporting documents listed above. The
documents should be signed by the natural person alone. A copy of the ID documents
of the natural person must also be included.
❖ Deputising persons — In case of temporary absence of the legal
representative(s) or their impossibility to sign, other persons empowered to act as
legal representatives (i.e. deputising persons) are accepted as legal representatives
by default. The reason for the temporary absence/impossibility and the legitimation of
the deputy will not be checked by the Central Validation Service and therefore
remains under the full responsibility of the participant (see also above under ‘internal
requirements’).
❖ Ministries — For ministries, Ministers are considered legal representatives by
default and there is no need to provide the legal documents proving their
empowerment.
In addition to the Minister's role, the following roles/functions are considered as legal
representatives by default, without any further verification of the legal documents
proving their empowerment:
− Deputy Minister
− State/General Secretary and their deputies
− Directors of certain specific horizontal sectors/departments/directions, namely
'legal', 'financial','European or international relationships'.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the ministry, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website of the ministry).
Except if otherwise provided in the applicable rules (law/decree/act governing the
organisation of the ministry), other roles such as ‘Director’/‘Had of Department’/‘Head
of Unit’, etc will be considered as having limited tasks and powers (relating only to
the directorate/department/unit’s policies) and, therefore, not entitled to represent
and engage the ministry as a whole.
For Ministers, the ID document can be exceptionally replaced by a badge or service
card (issued by the ministry). This exception applies only to the person of the
‘Minister’ and cannot be extended to other representatives (such as State Secretaries,
Deputy Ministers or Directors/Head of Departments); these persons are not exempted
from the obligation to provide an ID document.
❖ Public bodies and governmental entities — For public bodies and other
state/governmental entities, including executive services at central/regional/local
level, the highest-ranked person (e.g. Director-General, President, Mayor, etc) will be
recognized as legal representative by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the entity, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website).
❖ International organisations — For international organisations, the highest-
ranked person (e.g. Secretary, Secretary-General) will be recognised as legal
representative by default.
24EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the international organisation, the
evidence may also be taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the
organisational chart published on the official website of the international
organisation).
❖ Universities and higher education establishments — For universities and
other higher education establishments (e.g. colleges, institutes, etc), the following
roles/functions are recognised as legal representative by default, without any further
verification of their powers:
− Rector and Vice-Rector
− President and Vice-President
− Chancellor and Vice Chancellor.
In case of faculties with their own legal personality (and thus independently
validated), the Dean and Vice-Dean can also act as legal representatives by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the university/higher education
establishment/faculty, the evidence may also be taken from other appropriate
sources (e.g. the organisational chart published on the official internet-site of the
university/faculty).
3.3 LEAR replacement
A LEAR replacement is equivalent to a new LEAR appointment. For the replacement of
an already validated LEAR, participants must submit the same type of documents and
the Central Validation Service will follow the procedure for the validation of LEAR
appointment (see above).
3.4 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant did not respect the obligation to keep the original
documents or committed other irregularities, appropriate measures will be taken.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, or
contribution agreements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts
paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
4. Financial capacity assessment
4.1 Financial capacity assessment: Criteria and conditions
In addition to the legal entity validation and LEAR appointment, the Central Validation
Service also assists the EU services with the financial capacity assessment (required
by the Financial Regulation for grants and procurements; not needed for prizes or
contribution agreements).
25EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The financial capacity assessment must in principle be done for each new
application/tender (— unless the participant already has a valid financial capacity
assessment performed by the Central Validation Service that is not older than 18
months).
Additional conditions depend on the type of procedure (grant or procurement),
participant and grant amount (e.g. no financial capacity assessment is needed for
public bodies in grant procedures, for Member State organisations, international
organisations, persons in receipt of education support, persons most in need and in
receipt of direct support; for low-value grants and low-value procurements).
Additional exemptions are provided in some programmes for specific situations or
types of participants.
Moreover, the financial capacity may be assessed ad hoc if there are justified grounds
to doubt it, like for example:
− indication of weak/insufficient financial capacity from other sources
− involvement in cases of serious administrative errors or fraud
− pending legal procedures or judicial proceedings for serious administrative
errors or fraud
− attachment order or recovery order for an outstanding amount issued by an
EU body on which the payment is significantly overdue
− substantial findings in EU audits within the last 2 years that put in doubt the
financial capacity.
The financial capacity is assessed on the basis of financial indicators that are in
principle the same for all EU programmes.
The financial capacity assessment is normally done during grant preparation/tender
evaluation but may also be done during implementation. If a participants’ financial
capacity must be assessed, they will be contacted by the Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The role of the Central Validation Service is to prepare the financial capacity
assessment (e.g. to collect and to analyse the financial documents). The final decision
on the financial capacity will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender separately
by the EU service in charge.
4.2 Documents and information to provide
4.2.1 General requirements and principles
The financial assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the EU
services at any time).
As a general rule, financial documents must be provided in their original language(s),
as imposed by the legislation in the participant’s country of registration. For
documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit an English free
(unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in non-EU
languages, a free translation in English is always mandatory and needs to be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
26EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
Some examples of such documents are: dated and signed annual management
reports in English for a company listed on the stock exchange or having international
shareholders or for the purpose of consolidation within a foreign group; dated and
signed extracts from national registers that use English, etc.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as any information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw or correct the financial assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
4.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Profit and loss account — approved by the management of the entity, clearly
indicating the amounts of turnover from sales of goods and services, operating
income, staff, depreciation, amortization costs, net operating result and
interest expenses. If this information is not indicated in the profit and loss
account or in the explanatory notes it must be provided in the form of a self-
declaration.
2. Balance sheet statement — approved by the management, clearly indicating
the nature and the maturity (i.e. below or above one year) of receivables and
other current assets, grants, provisions and debts. If this information is not
indicated in the balance sheet or in the explanatory notes it must be provided
in the form of a self-declaration.
3. Explanatory notes and/or annexes that form part of the above financial
statements (if available).
4. External audit report or self-declaration
Participants requesting a grant amount of above 750 000 EUR (for action
grants) or above 100 000 EUR (for operating grants) must provide:
− an statutory audit report issued by an approved/certified external
auditor if:
− such a report is available or
− a statutory audit is required under EU or national law
or
27EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− a declaration on the validity of the accounts* (self-declaration), signed
by the legal representative of the entity, which certifies the validity of
the accounts.
The documents provided must cover the last two closed financial years. The most
recent year must have been closed within the last 18 months.
Exceptions are allowed for:
− start-up companies without closed annual accounts which provide
prospective data (business plan) for one year only
− recently created entities which have closed annual accounts for one year
only. These entities will be assessed based on the documents for the sole
closed financial year
A single financial document containing comparative data of the annual accounts of
both years under assessment will be accepted. The same applies to an external audit
report covering the two financial years.
If some (or all) of the documents have already been provided for the financial years
in question (i.e. uploaded in the Participant Register), the participant does not need
to submit them again.
The audit report must include:
− the clear mandate and scope of the audit
− the responsibilities of the management and the auditor
− the way in which the audit is carried out
− the auditor’s opinion, including a reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
All documents must be provided simultaneously (profit and loss account, balance
sheet, audit report/self-declaration, etc).
No audit report/self-declaration is needed for entities participating in tender
procedures, for natural persons and entities without closed accounts.
Specific cases
❖ Subsidiaries without own financial statements — Subsidiaries which do not
prepare their own financial statements may provide the consolidated accounts and
the audit report/self-declaration of the parent company/group they belong to under
the following conditions:
− the entity is exempt under national law from statutory audits
− only consolidated statements of the parent company/group the entity belongs
to are available
and
− the parent company assumes joint liability for all the debts of the entity (— all
conditions must be fulfilled).
In such cases, participants will be requested to provide additional documents to prove
these conditions.
28EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
❖ Parent companies — Parent companies which are exempt under national law
from publishing individual (i.e. non-consolidated) financial statements will be
requested to provide a dated and signed by the management simplified summary of
their non-consolidated profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
These simplified accounts must respect either the minimum reporting requirements
set out in the national accounting law or Annexes III, IV, V and VI of Directive
2013/349 (for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings
preceded by letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
If the provided financial information is not sufficiently clear, the Central Validation
Service may contact participants for further clarifications.
❖ Newly established enterprises that have not yet closed accounts — Must
provide estimated financial data (i.e. a business plan or a similar document including
financial projections on current and non-current assets, own capital, current and non-
current liabilities, turnover, operating and financial income and charges).
The financial data must respect either the minimum reporting requirements set out in
the national accounting law or to Annexes III, IV, V and VI of EU Directive 2013/34
(for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings preceded by
letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
❖ Natural persons engaged in an economic activity who do not prepare financial
statements in relation to their business activities — Are requested to provide:
− the annual income tax declaration containing details on the revenues and
expenses from business activity
− a signed declaration of patrimony, including:
− fixed patrimony (e.g. land, tenement, hereditament, medium/long-term
deposits (more than one year), stock options that cannot be exercised
within one year)
− current patrimony (e.g. available cash, savings, short-term deposits
(maximum of one year), stock-options that can be exercised within one
year)
and
− a signed declaration of debts, which must contain all liabilities (with dates and
figures), broken down in short-term debts (of maximum one year) and
medium/long-term debts (of more than one year).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities operating cash-based accounting — If the available financial
documents do not contain a profit and loss account and a balance sheet but are
limited to a cash flow statement and/or do not contain sufficient information10,
9 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual
financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of
undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and
repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19–76).
10 E.g. missing information on the nature of revenues, expenses or equity, nature and liquidity of
receivables and assets, maturity of debts etc.
29EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
declarations signed by the authorised legal representative of the entity may be
accepted, if they provide:
− information on fixed and current assets: buildings, equipment, inventory, cash,
short/long term11 deposits, short/long term receivables, sort/long term
liabilities, grants and equity/sources of funding, etc
− information on revenues and expenses, such as turnover from sales of goods
and services, operating income, staff expenses depreciation/amortisation
costs, interest expenses, etc.
In addition, it is recommended to provide any available evidence supporting the
declared amounts (e.g. bank statements confirming the available balance at
accounting closure date, etc).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities covered by a guarantor — Entities that are covered by a full financial
guarantee of another legal entity (i.e. guarantor) may submit the financial data of the
guarantor, provided that it is a full guarantee (i.e. the guarantor has assumed full
joint liability for all debts). Ad-hoc guarantees (covering, for instance, only the
participation in EU projects) cannot be accepted.
Participants that would like to have the financial capacity of their guarantor
assessed, must first contact the service in charge of their application for approval of
the guarantee. In case of approval, the service in charge will request the Central
Validation Service to proceed with the assessment of the guarantor.
4.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
If the financial documents do not contain sufficient information regarding the nature
and the maturity of the current assets, provisions and liabilities, and such information
is not provided, the financial assessment will be completed by taking the most
prudent approach, e.g. by considering the maturity of the current assets to be after
one year, and of the provisions and liabilities to be within one year.
11 Short term — maximum of one year; long term — more than one year.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The financial assessment is valid for 18 months after the closure date of the most
recent assessed accounting period. If during this period the participant applies for
another grant or tender, the financial documents will not be requested again.
However, if there are justified grounds to doubt the financial capacity, a new
assessment may be triggered even before the end of the 18 months.
4.4 Modification of the assessment
In case of disagreement with the assessment, the participant may contact the Central
Validation Service by sending additional justifications via Participant Register
message. The subject of the message should be clearly labelled as related to the
financial assessment (not PIC validation, LEAR assessment or other).
The Central Validation Service will carry out a re-assessment on the basis of the
additional documents.
4.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant made false declarations, their status may be
changed.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants or procurements, their
participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
5. Ownership control assessment
5.1 Ownership control assessment: Criteria and conditions
For funding programmes which have restricted calls in which only participants which
are directly or indirectly controlled by EU Member States or by nationals of EU
Member States (or by entities or nationals of specified eligible countries) are eligible,
the Central Validation Service will also handle the ownership control assessment
analysis.
The ownership control assessment must in principle be done for each new grant,
procurement or contribution agreement (— unless the participant already has a valid
ownership control assessment in the system performed by the Central Validation
Service that is not older than 18 months).
Moreover, the ownership control may be assessed ad hoc if there are grounds
justifying a new assessment, like for example:
− indication of third country control from other sources
− indication of ownership control changes after the initial assessment.
31EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The ownership control assessment will usually look into both ownership and control
elements, in order to assess whether an entity is EU controlled or non-EU controlled.
The focus is however on control (see Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and
CEF-DIG restricted calls*).
In this context, ‘control’ will be defined as the possibility to exercise decisive influence
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate entities, ‘de jure’ or ‘de facto’.
The fact that no influence is actually exercised is not relevant, as long as the
possibility exists.
Control will be assessed at the level of the ultimate ownership and control line and all
intermediate layers (in case of indirect control), taking into consideration decision-
making mechanisms, corporate governance, shareholders’/members’ rights, etc.
The assessment is based on the information provided by the participant in the
ownership control declaration* (annexed to their application for EU funding or
procurement procedure) and supporting documents to be provided by the participant
during the ownership control assessment procedure.
The role of the Central Validation Service is limited to identifying instances of
possible non-EU-country/entity control (e.g. to collect and to analyse the supporting
documents). The final decision will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender
separately by the EU service in charge, in accordance with the specific programme
rules.If needed, during grant preparation, the EU service in charge may contact
participants about the outcome of the ownership control assessment.
5.2 Documents and information to provide
5.2.1 General requirements and principles
The ownership control assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by
the participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be
kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the
EU services at any time).
As a general rule, ownership control documents must be provided in their original
language. For documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit
an English free (unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in
non-EU languages, a free translation in English is mandatory and must be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
The participant assumes full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as the information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
5.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Graph visualising the complete ownership structure/chain of control, including
all ownership layers/chain of control until the ultimate owners.
2. Proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners and their respective
percentage of interest and voting rights, for instance commercial registry
extracts, articles of association/incorporation documents/memorandum of
association/company’s shareholders/members/partners book/registry extract,
etc with the exact distribution of shares/voting rights, i.e. name of
shareholders/members/partners and their percentage of interest andvoting
rights, as well as information on their place of establishment (in case of legal
entity) or nationality (in case of natural persons).
3. Statutes, articles of association, shareholders’/partnership agreements,
memorandum of understanding among shareholders, investment agreements
between shareholders and other relevant documents regarding the decision-
making procedures within the legal entity and the related rights of the
shareholders/members/partners.
4. Documents establishing/describing the decision-making bodies, rules regarding
election, appointment, nomination, dismissal and tenure of members, and
decision-making procedures (e.g. articles of association, bylaws, reports on
corporate governance, internal corporate governance rules, minutes of board
meetings, etc).
5. For participants that are listed companies, subsidiaries or controlled by a listed
company: report/minutes of the last three shareholders meetings, together
with the attendance list identifying the present/represented shareholders and
their respective votes.
6. Cooperation agreements with customers or suppliers, when they could confer
control over the participant — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
7. For shareholders/owners that provide financial contributions: supporting
documents (loans, by-laws, etc) that justify the financial contribution;
documents showing the link between the shareholder/owner and the entity
providing the financing — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
8. Information about any other means, process or links that could ultimately
confer control to a non-EU country or non-EU country entity.
9. Copy of ID card(s) or passport(s) indicating the nationality of the ultimate
owner(s).
The same documents and information must be provided for each intermediate
controlling entity, up to the ultimate owners. The supporting documents must
demonstrate the complete ownership structure, including all layers of ownership and
non-controlling entities.
33EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Guarantees for non-EU controlled entities (if allowed by the call conditions and
required by the EU service in charge) are not part of the ownership control
assessment and must therefore be submitted directly to the EU service in charge of
the grant/tender, in accordance with the specific programme rules.
5.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
not to finalise the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and
documents submitted or publicly available).
5.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The ownership control assessment is in principle valid for 18 months. If during this
period the participant applies for another grant or tender and confirms that the
ownership control status has not changed, the supporting documents will not be
requested again.
In this case, the participants will still have to submit the ownership control
declaration with the application, but there will be no check by the Central Validation
Service, unless there are justified grounds to doubt the declaration.
5.4 Modification of the assessment
Changes in the ownership control status need to be communicated to the granting
authority/contracting authority, which will trigger a new assessment by the Central
Validation Service, if needed.
For more information on the ownership control assessment procedure, see the
Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and CEF-DIG restricted calls*.

EU FUNDING & TENDERS PORTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE
1.1 The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is an electronic portal and exchange
system managed by the European Commission and used by itself and several
other EU services (together ‘EU’), for the management of EU funding/tenders (i.e.
grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, experts, etc).
1.2 It is currently open to:
− users applying for or managing EU grants, tenders and prizes
− entities entering into EU contribution agreements
− external experts and audit firms appointed to work for the EU in the
context of EU funding programmes
and allows them to:
− register (in the Participant Register or Expert Data Base) and view and
edit their data
− create, revise and submit proposals for funding and tenders
− prepare and sign contracts
− manage their projects and contracts (e.g. submit deliverables, reports
and payment requests)
− for experts: perform their tasks inside the system (evaluation,
monitoring, etc)
− for external audit firms: perform their tasks inside the system (audit
management).
1.3 These Terms and Conditions govern the relation between the following parties:
− the European Commission (as owner of the Portal)
and
− users
in relation to access and use of the Portal.
For the avoidance of doubt, it does not cover the terms and conditions related to
the grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements or expert contracts that
are managed through the Portal; those are governed by their own legal framework
and contractual arrangements.
1.4 Requesting access to the Portal, accessing the Portal or using the Portal signifies
unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
Users will be requested to agree explicitly to the Terms and Conditions on their first
login to the Portal.
For users acting on behalf of organisations, the legal representatives of the
organisations will also be asked to explicitly agree at the moment they appoint their
LEAR/EXAFs (through the ‘declaration of consent’; see below).
3EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Organisations must provide their LEAR/EXAFs, LSIGNs and FSIGNs with a copy of
these Terms and Conditions.
Users are responsible for regularly verifying the applicable Terms and Conditions.
1.5 These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the
European Commission and users, as regards the conditions for access and use of
the Portal.
2. ACCESS TO THE PORTAL
2.1 Users
2.1.1 Access to the public parts of the Portal is open to all users.
2.1.2 Access to the Portal electronic exchange system (EES) is open only to persons
with an EU Login account.
2.1.3 Access rights to certain information and functions in the EES are restricted to
users with specific roles (which are in turn linked to their functions within their
organisation or in relation to a particular
proposal/project/grant/contract/agreement).
2.1.4 Organisations can access the EES only via individual users employed by or
representing them.
2.2 Means of access to the EES — EU Login user account
2.2.1 Users must obtain an EU Login account in accordance with the applicable
procedures.
Users who already have an EU Login account must use that account.
2.2.2 Users guarantee that the information provided for registration for the account is
accurate and complete.
The European Commission has — at any time — the right to verify the accuracy
and validity of the information.
If this reveals any inaccuracy or invalidity, the European Commission has the right
to close the account and suspend or refuse access.
2.2.3 The means of access (i.e. the user name and password) are strictly personal and
users are responsible for safeguarding their confidentiality and security, and
ensuring their appropriate use.
Users undertake to take all steps to prevent any unauthorised third party from
gaining knowledge and making use thereof.
Users may not transfer or sell their means of access to third parties.
Users must notify the European Commission immediately (via the IT Helpdesk;
see Funding & Tenders Portal Support menu) of the loss, theft, breach of
confidentiality or any risk of misuse of the means of access.
If the European Commission has any reason to suspect that the confidentiality or
security of the means of access has been breached or that the EES is being
misused, it may — without prior notice — suspend or refuse access.

2.4 LEAR appointment
2.4.1 Organisations using the EES for transactions requiring electronic signatures are
required to appoint a LEAR.
2.4.2 Individuals (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons) will automatically have the
role of LEAR (no appointment needed); but they will have to provide the
supporting documents. Organisations can appoint only one LEAR — who can be
replaced if necessary, following the same appointment process.
2.4.3 Organisations warrant that the person appointed as LEAR is duly authorised to
represent them in relation to all LEAR responsibilities.
Organisations are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of the LEAR
responsibilities and to ensure that the LEAR remains at all times duly authorised
to represent them in relation to these responsibilities.
2.4.4 Supporting documents must be provided directly in the system.
2.4.5 Signed originals must be kept on file for controls (which may take place at any
moment and independently of any ongoing grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements or expert contracts).
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to the closure of the EU Login

grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements and expert contracts).
2.5 Appointment of signatories in the EES — (P)LSIGNs and (P)FSIGNs
2.5.1 The LEAR must appoint one or more LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation.
2.5.2 The LEAR and its organisation warrant that the persons appointed as LSIGNs or
FSIGNs are duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to all LSIGN
or FSIGN responsibilities.
The LEAR and its organisation are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of
the LSIGN and FSIGN responsibilities and to ensure that the LSIGNs and FSIGNs
remain at all times duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to
these responsibilities.

procurements and contribution agreements from the list of LSIGNs and FSIGNs for
their organisation.
2.6 Data updates on the EES roles
2.6.1 The LEAR is responsible for keeping data related to the organisation roles up-to-
date.
2.6.2 The CoCo/PaCo are responsible for keeping data related to the project roles up-to-
date.
2.7 Deactivation of old e-mail addresses/accounts
2.7.1 The LEAR has the ultimate responsibility for overseeing that old e-mail
addresses/user accounts are deactivated and removed from the organisation- and
project roles.
2.8 General obligation to channel information to the right addressees
2.8.1 If made aware of misled communications, the LEAR has the obligation to re-direct
them and ensure proper follow-up and correction for the future.

and omissions of persons employed by or representing them, acting as users of
the Portal.
3.1.6 Users are liable for — and will indemnify and hold harmless the European
Commission against — any damage that results from:
− changes made to the Portal or
− use of the Portal in a manner that does not correspond with these Terms and
Conditions.
3.2 Required hardware, software and services
3.2.1 Users acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for the choice, purchase
and operation of hardware, software and telecommunication services required to

minimum requirements, as specified on the Portal (if any).
Users are responsible for the installation and costs of purchasing and licensing
such hardware, software or telecommunication services.
3.2.2 The European Commission is not liable for hardware, software, products and

integrity of the data and the accuracy of the date and time of sending or
receiving (as indicated by the EES logs)
(b) a document sent or notified through the EES is considered as equivalent
to a paper document, is admissible as evidence in legal proceedings, is
deemed original and enjoys legal presumption of its authenticity and
integrity, provided it does not contain any dynamic features capable of
automatically changing it

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
3.3.2 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) any communication or document sent or notified using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper document with a handwritten signature and shall be
admissible as evidence in legal proceedings and constitute sufficient
evidence in legal proceedings
(b) any declaration, contract (or amendment) signed using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper declaration/contract with a handwritten signature and shall

contract submitted or signed through the EES as evidence in legal
proceedings, solely on the basis that such communication,
document, declaration or contract was submitted electronically
through the EES or signed with an electronic signature.
3.3.3 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) communications in the EES are generally considered to have been made
when they are sent by the sending party (i.e. on the date and time they
are sent through the EES, as indicated by the time logs)
(b) where formal notifications are required, these are considered to have
been made when they are received by the receiving party (i.e. on the
date and time they are accessed in the EES by the receiving party, as
indicated by the time logs); formal notifications that have not been
accessed within 10 calendar days after sending are considered to have
been accessed.
3.3.4 The European Commission registers access and use of the EES.
This access and use log provides evidence that access and use has been made of
EES, unless users can prove the contrary.
3.3.5 Electronic messages, connections, operations on the network and transactions
between the EU and the users shall be proven using the logs and transaction files
kept electronically by the European Commission.
Users accept the evidential value of this data.
This does not prevent the parties from providing other proof, using permitted
legal methods (such as proof on paper).
3.4 Intellectual property rights
3.4.1 The intellectual and industrial property rights and know-how associated with the
Portal belong exclusively to the European Commission and its licensors.
Only the European Commission has the right to correct errors.
12EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
3.4.2 The European Commission grants users a non-transferable, limited, non-exclusive
licence to use the Portal for their own professional purposes (unless access is
suspended or refused).
Without prejudice to the rights of users under applicable legislation relating to the
protection of computer programs (which cannot be contractually denied), users
may not in any way:
(a) modify, translate or adapt the Portal
(b) decompile or disassemble the Portal
(c) copy the Portal (or parts of it)
(d) pass on, dispose of, grant as a sub-licence, lease, lend or distribute the
Portal or Portal documentation to third parties
(e) create any product or service substantially similar to the Portal or
(f) copy any ideas, characteristics or functions of the Portal.
3.5 Portal availability
3.5.1 The European Commission will to the best of its abilities take reasonable care to
ensure the availability of the Portal.
The European Commission does not guarantee that the Portal will be available
without interruption or degradation of service.
In case of technical problems affecting the submission of application documents,
the European Commission reserves the right to cancel calls without entitlement to
compensation.
3.6 Suspension and refusal of access
3.6.1 Users acknowledge that the European Commission may refuse access to a user
logging in, if a session is already open on another computer where another user is
using the same means of access (i.e. the same EU Login account name and
password).
3.6.2 Users acknowledge and accept that the European Commission may suspend or
