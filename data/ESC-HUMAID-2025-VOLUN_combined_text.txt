3European Solidarity Corps Programme in brief
The European Union is built on solidarity: solidarity between its citizens, solidarity across
borders between its Member States, and solidarity in its action inside and outside the Union.
The European Solidarity Corps Programme (‘the Corps’ or ‘the Programme’) initiative was
launched in December 2016. It aimed to create new opportunities for young people to engage
in solidarity-related activities for the benefit of communities and people around Europe and
first operated within the context of eight pre-existing EU programmes.
In 2018, the first European Solidarity Corps Programme Regulation1 created a new, coherent
framework for solidarity-related activities, with a dedicated budget of EUR 375.6 million for
2018-2020. It offered new formats and tools, with a sustained commitment to quality, in order
to reach out to more young people and provide them with a valuable experience.
Between the launch of the Corps and the end of 2020, almost a quarter of a million young
people registered on the Portal of the European Solidarity Corps, which demonstrates an
extremely high interest in the initiative. Based on the positive reception of the initiative by
young people and other stakeholders in the solidarity sector, the European Commission
proposed an extension of the Corps to the programming period 2021-27.
The adoption of Regulation (EU) No 2021/8882 gave the green light to a new generation of the
Corps, covering the period of 2021-2027, with a budget of more than EUR 1 billion in current
prices and activities that also now include volunteering in the area of humanitarian aid. The
current generation programme now focusses fully on volunteering, in line with the wishes of
the legislators.
By extending its scope to cover volunteering activities in support of humanitarian aid
operations, the Corps now also contributes to needs-based humanitarian aid anchored on the
fundamental principles of neutrality, humanity, independence and impartiality, and will help to
deliver assistance, relief and protection where most needed. The Corps thus helps to address
not only unmet societal needs in Europe but also humanitarian challenges in non-EU countries
that have been or that could potentially be affected by man-made or natural disasters.
Humanitarian aid volunteering actions of the European Solidarity Corps are guided by the
European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid3.
Young people engaged in the Corps bring tangible benefits to places and communities in need.
By participating in the Corps, they also gain essential personal, social and civic competences
that will help them better cope in a rapidly changing world.
One of the transversal priorities of the European Solidarity Corps is to support participation in
democratic life, promote common values and foster active citizenship. This was a key focus of
the European Year of Youth 2022 which aimed to help young people to become active and
engaged citizens. The Programme will build on the achievements of the Year and contribute to
1 Regulation (EU) 2018/1475 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 October 2018 laying down the legal framework of the
European Solidarity Corps and amending Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013, Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 and Decision No 1313/2013/EU
2 Regulation (EU) 2021/888 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021 establishing the European Solidarity Corps

4its long-lasting legacy as outlined in the Communication on the European Year of Youth
adopted by the Commission on 10 January, 20244.
The Corps contributes to achieving the objectives of the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027 (the
EUYS) which is the framework for EU cooperation in the youth field based on a 2018 Council
Resolution5. The Commission has carried out an interim evaluation of the EUYS6 as foreseen
in the Council Resolution, which was adopted on 11 April 2024. The evaluation complemented
the Communication on the European Year of Youth 2022, both aiming to support future
reflections on the post 2027 EUYS.
One of the key overall objectives of the EU Youth Strategy is to ‘Encourage young people to
become active citizens, agents of solidarity and positive change for communities across Europe,
inspired by EU values and a European identity’. Under the ‘Connect’7 priority area, the
Commission proposes to expand mobility actions under the Corps and support its
implementation through stronger policy cooperation and community-building activities.
The programme also offers a strong international dimension and contributes to the delivery of
the Global Gateway strategy for a Stronger Europe in the World. Cooperation in volunteering
activities has gradually become an important instrument for the implementation of EU external
policies, based on European values, trust and autonomy.
The indicative budget of the 2025 European Solidarity Corps work programme amounts to EUR
166 000 0008. It constitutes the Financing Decision within the meaning of Article 110 of the
Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July
2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union9 (the ‘Financial
Regulation’ or ‘FR’).

5Part I – General overview
1.1. STRUCTURE OF THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS
1.1.1. Objectives and actions of the European Solidarity Corps
According to the Regulation (EU) 2021/888 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
20 May 2021 establishing the European Solidarity Corps Programme and repealing Regulation
(EU) 2018/1475 and Regulation (EU) No 375/2014 (hereafter ‘the Regulation’), the general
objective of the European Solidarity Corps Programme (hereafter the ‘Programme’) is to
enhance the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible and high-quality
solidarity activities, primarily volunteering, as a means to strengthen cohesion, solidarity,
democracy, European identity and active citizenship in the Union and beyond, addressing
societal and humanitarian challenges on the ground, with a particular focus on the promotion
of sustainable development, social inclusion and equal opportunities. As such, it also
contributes to European cooperation that is relevant to young people.
The Programme sets up the following strands of actions:
(a) participation of young people in solidarity-related activities’ strand, as referred to in
Chapter III of the European Solidarity Corps Regulation;
(b) participation of young people in solidarity-related humanitarian aid activities’ strand (the
‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’), as referred to in Chapter IV of the
Regulation.
The specific objective of the Programme is to provide young people, including young people
with fewer opportunities, with easily accessible opportunities for engagement in solidarity
activities that induce positive societal changes in Europe and abroad, while improving and
properly validating their competences, as well as facilitating their continuous engagement as
active citizens.
To achieve its objective, the Corps implements the following operational actions:
• volunteering (volunteering under the ‘participation of young people in solidarity
activities’ strand and under the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps);
• solidarity projects;
• networking activities;
• quality and support measures.
1.1.2. Participating countries
EU Member states take part in the European Solidarity Corps Programme, as well as the
overseas countries and territories. In addition, the following non-EU countries are associated to
the Programme in 202510, in accordance with Article 13 of the European Solidarity Corps
Regulation and based on specific agreements covering their association to the Programme:
10 Countries that are considered to be associated to the Programme as of 1 January 2021 are listed. If and when more non-EU countries
complete the association process, this information will be made available on the website of the European Solidarity Corps. For the purposes
6• Iceland;
• Liechtenstein;
• Republic of North Macedonia;
• Türkiye.
In accordance with Article 13 (2) of the European Solidarity Corps Regulation, the third
countries associated to the Programme may only participate in the Programme in its entirety
provided that they fulfil all the obligations which this Regulation imposes on EU Member
States.
In accordance with Article 14 (2) of the European Solidarity Corps Regulation, legal entities
from other third countries non-associated to the Programme may be eligible for the actions
referred to in Articles 5 and 7 of the Regulation (networking activities, quality and support
measures and volunteering under the ‘participation of young people in solidarity activities’
strand) in duly justified cases and in the EU’s interest. Among this group of applicants, in line
with the EU Youth Strategy 2021-2027 11, Council conclusions of 5 June 2020 on Youth in
external action12 and the Youth Action Plan (YAP) in EU external action 2022 – 202713, special
consideration will be given to candidate countries, Eastern Partnership countries and Western
Balkan countries, as well as other countries with whom the EU has association or cooperation
agreements. The cooperation with these countries is in the EU’s strategic interest as it fosters
the connectedness of this group of applicants with the applicants of EU Member States. For the
participation of applicants from non-associated countries not falling within the aforementioned
categories of countries in the actions referred to in Article 5 and 7 of the Regulation, it will be
needed to spell out why broader eligibility is duly justified and in the EU’s interest.
Under the EU Enlargement Policy, the programme can be an important instrument to strengthen
the informal and non-formal educational and volunteering systems of acceding countries,
candidate countries and potential candidate countries and contribute to the process of aligning
their legislation to meet the EU standards.
Another crucial aspect of the European Solidarity Corps is its ability to attract new talents to
the EU, ensuring the Union’s competitiveness in the global labour market. Ultimately, the
European Solidarity Corps can serve as a powerful tool for building bridges between diverse
societies and fostering connections between like-minded individuals across Europe and the
world.
of the eligibility conditions, applicants established in third countries negotiating association to the programme will be treated as entities
established in an Associated Country, if the programme association agreement with the third country concerned applies at the time of the
signature of the grant agreement.
11 As mentioned in Recital 2.b of the Resolution of the Council of the European Union and the Representatives of the Governments of the
Member States meeting within the Council on a framework for European cooperation in the youth field: The European Union Youth
Strategy 2019-2027 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A42018Y1218%2801%29
12 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8629-2020-INIT/en/pdf
13 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52022JC0053
7The participation of entities from such countries is limited to acceding countries, candidate
countries14 and potential candidate countries15 and, for volunteering in solidarity activities, third
countries not associated to the programme neighbouring the EU16, and for humanitarian aid
volunteering, to third countries where humanitarian aid activities and operations take place and
where there are no ongoing international or non-international armed conflicts, subject to a
substantiated Union’s interest as spelt out under each of the programme actions concerned.
The participation of these countries is fully in line with the EU Youth Strategy which calls “to
foster the connectedness between young people in the EU and candidate countries, Eastern
Partnership and Western Balkan partners, as well as with other third countries with whom the
EU has association or cooperation agreements.” “Connections, relations and exchange of
experience are a pivotal asset for solidarity and the future development of the European Union.
This connection is best fostered through different forms of mobility.”
In addition, the Council conclusions of 5 June 2020 on Youth in external action, stresses the
contribution of young generations to building stronger, more legitimate, peaceful and
democratic societies, the programme contributes to promoting the meaningful participation and
engagement of all young people, and hence in strengthening exchanges and dialogue between
young people from the Union and partner countries, including the Eastern Partnership, the
Western Balkans and the Southern Neighbourhood.
This is further supported by the Youth Action Plan (YAP) in EU external action 2022 – 2027.
Specifically, the Youth Action Plan states that the EU will further promote young people-to-
people contacts through the existing initiatives like the European Solidarity Corps, encouraging
the participation of young people in volunteering and solidarity projects.
It is therefore concluded that participation of entities from – as well as participation by
individuals legally residing in - the countries mentioned in footnotes 14-16 below is in the
Union’s interest within the meaning of Article 14(2) of the Solidarity Corps Regulation.17
Organisations and individuals of third countries not associated to the Programme, including
subsidiaries of such organisations and entities held by such third country individuals, may not
be considered eligible to take part in some or all actions of the European Solidarity Corps
programme, based on restrictive measures or guidelines adopted at EU level.
1.1.3. Bodies implementing the programme
The European Commission (Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture –
DG EAC) is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the European Solidarity Corps. It
manages the budget and sets priorities, targets and criteria for the Corps on an ongoing basis.
Furthermore, it guides and monitors the general implementation, follow-up and evaluation of
the Programme at European level.
14 Candidate countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia, Territory of Ukraine as recognised by
international law): https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/eu-enlargement_en
15 Potential candidate country (Kosovo)
16 Third countries neighbouring the EU (1. EFTA country: Norway; 2. Neighbourhood East (Region 2): Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus; 3.
South-Mediterranean (Region 3): Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia) and 4. Russian
Federation (Region 4): Territory of Russia as recognised by international law.
17 Participation by entities from third countries not associated to the Programme can however not be directly funded, see Art. 18 of the
Solidarity Corps Regulation.
8The Commission also bears overall responsibility for supervising and coordinating the
structures in charge of implementing the Programme at national level and directly manages
certain Programme actions. At European level, the European Education and Culture Executive
Agency (‘Executive Agency’) is also responsible for implementing certain actions of the Corps
(actions under direct management).
Implementation by the Executive Agency is according to the Commission Decision
C(2022) 5057 delegating powers to the European Education and Culture Executive Agency.
The actions of the Corps are mostly implemented through indirect management. The
Commission entrusts budget implementation tasks to National Agencies (NAs) established in
each Member State and third country associated to the Programme. National authorities monitor
and supervise the management of the Programme at national level. In accordance with Articles
62 (1) (c) and 154 of the Financial Regulation, the Commission may entrust NAs budget
implementation tasks via the conclusion of Contribution Agreements under indirect
management mode.
1.2. POLICY FRAMEWORK AND PRIORITIES
1.2.1. General policy framework
The European Union is built on solidarity, a shared value which is strongly felt throughout
European society. Solidarity defines the European project and provides the necessary unity to
cope with current and future crises. Solidarity provides a clear compass to guide European
youth in their aspirations for a better Union. In the Rome Declaration, on the occasion of the
60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, the leaders of 27 Member States and of the European
Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission reaffirmed their commitment
to enhance unity and solidarity in order to increase the strength and resilience of the EU18.
Young people need easily accessible opportunities to engage in solidarity activities, through
which they can help communities while acquiring useful experience, skills and competences
for their personal, educational, social, civic and professional development, thereby improving
their employability, their societal engagement, participation in society and social inclusion.
The establishment of the European Solidarity Corps was announced in 2016 as part of the EU’s
effort to promote solidarity and increase its investment in young people. The initiative was
launched in the same year, by mobilising various EU programmes offering solidarity-related
opportunities to young people. Following the adoption of the first European Solidarity Corps
Regulation for 2018-2020, the activities of the Corps further expanded, making it a single-entry
point for organisations and young people engaged in solidarity-related activities in Europe.
The Corps opens new opportunities for young people to carry out volunteering activities in
solidarity-related areas and to devise and develop solidarity projects based on their own
initiative. The Corps also supports networking activities for participants and organisations, as
well as measures to ensure the quality of the supported activities and provide for the validation
of their learning outcomes.
18 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/03/25-rome-declaration.
9The Corps builds on the strengths and synergies of existing and preceding programmes, notably
the European Voluntary Service and the EU Aid Volunteers. Consistency and complementarity
with other programmes operating in solidarity-related areas is also ensured.
Young people are at the heart of the European project. The activities of the Corps are thereby
coherent with the EU Youth Strategy for 2019-2027, adopted by the Council Resolution 19￼.
The EU Youth Strategy sets the framework for the European cooperation in the youth field, for
the benefit of young people and encourages cooperation in core youth policy areas in order to
engage, connect and empower young people. It also promotes cross-sectoral approaches and
youth mainstreaming to address the needs of young people in various EU policy areas such as
employment, but also climate change, environment, digitalization, health and other areas that
affect them. The strategy makes reference to the 11 Youth Goals￼ covering several fields that
young people consider to be important. This overarching strategy is implemented through two
of the main EU programmes supporting youth: Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps -
both programmes aiming to support, engage, connect and empower young people even more
effectively, notably through mobility and cooperation activities.
The Corps is aligned with the ambitions of the European Commission outlined in the
Communication on the European Year of Youth adopted on 10 January 202420 to give young
people a stronger role in EU policymaking and to address youth concerns across key areas:
health and wellbeing, environment and climate, education and training, international
cooperation and European values, employment and inclusion.
As a legacy of the European Year of Youth, in 2025 the European Commission will further
increase volunteering opportunities for young people to address the green transition. This is one
of the sixty actions put forward by the European Commission in the follow-up of the European
Year of Youth.
Humanitarian aid volunteering actions of the European Solidarity Corps are guided by the
European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid21 and strive to contribute to enhancing the
effectiveness and efficiency of Union humanitarian aid, in line with the Good Humanitarian
Donorship principles. International humanitarian law and human rights law are promoted. In
this regard, the European Solidarity Corps contributes to a positive image of Europe in the
world, spreading its fundamental values, thus also facilitating international policy dialogue
and EU public diplomacy actions.
Finally, the activities of the Corps are in line with the Commission’s Reflection Paper –
Towards a Sustainable Europe by 203022. Just as with the Youth Goals, the Corps’ activities
help to achieve several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
As foreseen in the European Solidarity Corps Regulation, the Commission and the Member
States will cooperate on volunteering policies in the youth field via the open method of
coordination. The EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027, among others, aims to encourage young

10people to become active EU citizens23, agents of solidarity and positive change for communities
across Europe, inspired by EU values as enshrined in the Treaties24 and by a European identity.
The interim evaluation of the EU Youth Strategy resulted in a positive assessment of the
Strategy and its instruments, with proposals for further enhancing its influence, echoing the
priority actions in the Communication on the European Year of Youth legacy, with the focus
to give young people a stronger say in areas of their concern. The next EU Youth Report
(planned for 2025) will cover the follow-up of some of the legacy actions of the European Year
of Youth and of the results of the EU Youth Strategy evaluation.
More specifically, to give further meaning to the aspirations to involve young people in
solidarity-related activities, and to ensure that the Corps can reach its full potential in
cooperation with national schemes, the EU Youth Strategy suggests that the Commission and
Member States cooperate on a supportive political, legal and administrative environment.
The Council Resolution on the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027, and the annexed EU work plan
for youth 2019-2021, called for the review of the 2008 Council Recommendation on the
mobility of young volunteers25. The Commission proposed this review in 2021, and the new
Council Recommendation on the mobility of young volunteers across the European Union26
was adopted in the spring of 2022, with the ambition to address the barriers that still hinder the
involvement of youth in cross-border volunteering and solidarity and to provide also concrete
actions to promote this mobility.
Complementarity with existing EU-level information networks relevant to the activities of the
Corps, such as the Eurodesk network, will be ensured, as well as complementarity with existing
schemes (particularly national solidarity schemes and mobility schemes for young people). The
2021-2027 Corps strives to build on the successful experience of the 2018-2020 period and
further extend the scale of volunteering opportunities to the area of humanitarian aid, to
contribute to the provision of principled, needs-based assistance to communities in third
countries, notably in the area of disaster preparedness and post-disaster relief27.
Since 2018, the European Solidarity Corps has become a unique gateway for solidarity
opportunities across the European Union and beyond. As Europe was hit hard by the COVID-
19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and by a series of natural disasters and extreme-weather events
in 2021, the European Solidarity Corps demonstrated its resilience and adaptability, when
participating organisations and young people stepped in to provide relief and assistance to
communities and individuals wherever possible.
In 2025, in the context of the impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine that
continues to affect the lives of millions of people in the direct vicinity of the EU borders, the
Corps will continue demonstrating the value of solidarity, in its action inside and outside the
Union, by offering relief and assistance to the communities and individuals whose lives have
been disrupted by the war that started in 2022.
23 The European Solidarity Corps is listed as a priority action in the EU Citizenship Report 2017: Strengthening Citizens’ Rights in a Union
of Democratic Change, COM(2017)030, 24.01.2017.
24 The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human
rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which
pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.
25 OJ C 319, 13.12.2008 p.8
26 OJ C 157, 11.4.2022 p. 1
27 Including post-conflict relief.
111.2.2. Policy priorities
In addition to the objectives of the Programme outlined in section 1.1, the work programme
2025 will continue to pursue the following transversal priorities applicable to the EU actions in
the field of youth, fully in line with the European Education Area28, the Digital Education
Action Plan29 and the European Democracy Action Plan30. A gender equality perspective will
be mainstreamed throughout the Programme, in line with the principles of the Gender Equality
Strategy 2020-2517.
• Inclusion and diversity
The European Solidarity Corps supports projects and activities actively addressing the issue of
inclusion and diversity of all young people in the society.
In general, the Corps aims to promote social inclusion, tolerance, human rights and the value
of differences and diversity, and to provide all young people with equal access to the
opportunities offered under its actions. An inclusion and diversity strategy for the Programme
has been developed to support organisations in reaching out to more participants with fewer
opportunities, including individuals who for economic, social, cultural, geographical31 or health
reasons, a migrant background, or for reasons such as disability and educational difficulties or
for any other reasons, including those that can give rise to discrimination under article 21 of the
Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, face various obstacles compared to their
peers. Appropriate mechanisms and resources are available to make sure that the specific needs
of participants with fewer opportunities can be catered for.
The thematic SALTO32 Resource Centre for Inclusion and Diversity will also contribute to
high-quality and inclusive implementation for this dimension of the Programme.
• Environmental sustainability and climate goals
Climate and biodiversity mainstreaming
The actions supported by the Programme contribute to the overall climate and biodiversity
objective, as presented below, both by the prioritisation of the green transition and by the
promotion of green practices at the level of the projects throughout the Programme.

partnerships.ec.europa.eu/countries/overseas-countries-and-territories_en)
32 Support, Advanced Learning and Training Opportunities
12The European Solidarity Corps aims to make a meaningful contribution to the Commission’s
commitment to tackling climate and environmental-related challenges33. The Programme
supports projects and activities aiming to protect, conserve and enhance natural capital, to raise
awareness about environmental sustainability and to enable behavioural changes linked to
individual preferences, consumption habits and lifestyles. The Programme supports initiatives
aimed at preventing and mitigating or repairing the adverse effects of extreme weather events
and natural disasters, as well as activities that provide support to affected communities in the
aftermath of such extreme weather events or natural disasters.
In general, the Corps promotes the incorporation of green practices in all projects, regardless of
the main focus of their activities. Organisations and participants involved with the Corps should
have an environmentally friendly approach when designing their activities34. Activities
contributing to other existing EU initiatives in the area of environmental sustainability (e.g. the
New European Bauhaus, EU Missions35 and the EU Forest Strategy - more specifically its
“3 billion trees” initiative on oceans clean-up, ecosystems restoration, city decarbonisation,
climate risk adaptation, landscape regeneration) are highly encouraged. Furthermore, supported
activities should strive to be as energy-efficient as possible and to make responsible choices in
terms of energy use at the level of projects, as well as encourage other stakeholders and target
groups of their activities - wherever relevant - to make such choices too.
The thematic green SALTO Resource Centre set up in 2022 will contribute to high-quality and
inclusive implementation of the green dimension of the Programme.
• Digital transformation
The Political Guidelines of the European Commission36 underline the need for Europe to lead
the digital transition. The Digital Education Action Plan encourages action at all levels to
contribute to the digital transformation through all forms of learning. The Corps aims to support
Europeans, regardless of their gender, age and background, to live and thrive in the digital age
through projects and activities that help to improve digital skills in general and/or foster digital
literacy and to develop an understanding of the risks and opportunities of digital technology.
In general, the Corps promotes the use of appropriate and accessible information,
communication and technology tools in all projects, regardless of the main focus of their
activities.
Finally, the thematic digital SALTO Resource Centre set up in 2022 will contribute to high-
quality and inclusive implementation for the digital dimension of the Programme.
33 In line with the Conclusions of the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council
– Fostering engagement among young people as actors of change in order to protect the environment 2022/C 159/07
34 In line with the European Green Deal as a blueprint for sustainable growth, the actions supported by this programme should aim to respect
the “do no significant harm” principle without changing the fundamental character of the programme. When designing their actions,
applicants should incorporate measures that offset or at least considerably reduce the environmental impact of project activities, using for
instance the online pledge platform of the Education for Climate Coalition of the pledge platform or the European Climate Pact
(https://europa.eu/climate-pact/pledges_en).

missions-horizon-europe_en
36 https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age_en
13• Participation in democratic life, common values and civic engagement
Participation, promotion of European common values and civic engagement are at the heart of
the Corps. The activities supported by the Programme should aim to strengthen European
identity (notably as regards common EU values, the principles of unity and diversity, and
participating countries’ social, cultural and historical heritage) and the participation of young
people in democratic processes including European, national, regional and local elections, and
through involvement in other EU initiatives, platforms revolving around participation and civic
engagement.
Moreover, the European Solidarity Corps’ implementation and therefore, the programme
beneficiaries and the activities implemented under this Annual Work Programme have to
respect the EU values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of
law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, in full
compliance with the values and rights enshrined in the Article 2 of the Treaty on the European
Union and the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union, particularly Article 21 on non-discrimination.
The thematic SALTO Resource Centre for Participation & Information will contribute to high-
quality and inclusive implementation for this dimension of the Programme.
In addition to the four transversal priorities outlined above, the work programme 2025 will also
support the following specific annual policy priorities defined for the ‘Volunteering teams in
high priority areas’ in 2025, addressing policy areas of relevance to young people as highlighted
in the recent Commission Communication on the European Year of Youth 2022. These
priorities can also inspire projects in actions implemented at decentralised level.
• Relief for persons fleeing armed conflicts and other victims of natural or man-made
disasters
The Corps can add significant value by contributing to the provision of relief and assistance to
those whose lives, livelihoods and communities have been disrupted by the natural or man-
made disasters, including armed conflicts. The importance of solidarity among individuals and
communities, within or across borders, has become even more apparent with the Russian
invasion of Ukraine and the resulting big inflow of displaced people into the EU, frequent
occurrences of extreme weather events (e.g. floods and forest fires) as well as large-scale
seismic events in certain countries. It is crucial to use the Corps’ potential to implement
community-based activities that foster sustained empathy and solidarity among young people
and also facilitate exchange and cooperation between people from different backgrounds.
• Fostering positive learning experiences and outcomes for young people with fewer
opportunities
The Corps can provide significant value by assisting children and young people from
disadvantaged backgrounds, with disabilities or otherwise vulnerable groups with the
attainment of adequate learning achievements. The European Year of Youth and the European
Year of Skills have fostered the efforts in reaching out to all young people, including those with
fewer opportunities. The Commission Communication “Putting people first, securing
14sustainable and inclusive growth, unlocking the potential of the EU’s outermost regions”37
underlines that the European Solidarity Corps inclusion and diversity strategy helps young
people from these regions to participate in the programme.
• Promoting waste management and recycling solutions
The Corps can provide significant value by promoting activities intended to raise awareness
about environmental issues and stress the importance of waste segregation and recycling
techniques. Involving local communities should be a priority in order to build positive and
sustainable habits and ensure their longevity, which in turn would result in stronger community
bonds, the sense of togetherness and shared responsibility. This priority is particularly relevant
in the context of the municipal and packaging waste targets for 2025 introduced by the Waste
Framework Directive 2008/98/EC.
While the specific priorities in this section formally apply to the direct management action
“Volunteering teams in high priority areas”, all other actions of the European Solidarity Corps
will continue to be mobilised to contribute to these areas as well.
Beyond the level of transversal and annual priorities, the activities of the European Solidarity
Corps will strongly support action in the following areas:
European Solidarity Corps and the Legacy of the European Year of Youth
One of the transversal priorities of the European Solidarity Corps is to support participation in
democratic life, promote common values and foster active citizenship. This was a key focus of
the European Year of Youth 2022 which aimed to help young people to become active and
engaged citizens, notably those that involve youth at risk of social exclusion and discrimination
and those living in remote or EU outermost regions, including the Overseas Countries and
Territories (OCTs).
Building on the achievements and contributing to the long-lasting legacy of the Year, the
Programme will continue to empower young people and to encourage their participation in
democratic life in 2025.
European Solidarity Corps and promotion of health and wellbeing
Across all its actions, the Corps aims to support activities related to prevention, promotion and
support in the field of health, in line with the HealthyLifeStyle4All, with special focus on
supporting vulnerable or disadvantaged population groups. Volunteers may be mobilised
around major health challenges, especially regarding wellbeing, mental health, as well as policy
priorities such as cancer prevention and care (Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan is a flagship
initiative of the current Commission).
European Solidarity Corps and Innovation
Across all its actions, the Corps also strives to add value by promoting and supporting new

1.3. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME
The next sections will highlight the main actions and initiatives that the Commission plans to
carry out in 2025, in cooperation with the implementing structures of the Programme.
In 2025, the Commission is planning to launch a general call for proposals to cover actions
under sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3.
In line with Article 29 of the European Solidarity Corps Regulation, the National Agencies can
draw up funding strategies that clarify the conditions for activities considered as
complementary to their national schemes.
A complete and more detailed description of the grants and procurements that will be awarded
in 2025 under the European Solidarity Corps is available in Part II of this work programme.
1.3.1. Volunteering
Volunteering under the ‘participation of young people in solidarity activities’ strand will be
carried out through individual volunteering activities or activities by volunteering teams in
2025.
Individual volunteering activities are carried out as voluntary unpaid activities for a period of
up to 12 months. This provides young people with the opportunity to contribute to the daily
work of organisations in solidarity-related activities to benefit the communities within which
the activities are carried out, either in a country other than the country of residence of the
participant (cross-border) or in the country of residence of the participant (in-country). Such
volunteering must not substitute traineeships and/or jobs and must be based on a written
volunteering agreement.
Activities by volunteering teams are designed to allow participants in the Corps carry out
solidarity-related activities together (i.e. in teams) for a period of between 2 weeks and 2
months. Such activities could contribute especially to the inclusion of young people with fewer
opportunities in the Corps and/or be justified due to their specific aims.
Main actions planned for 2025
The following actions will be implemented under the general call for proposals:
• The Volunteering Projects action will involve individual volunteering and/or activities
by volunteering teams. Projects are expected to start in 2025 or at the beginning of 2026,
with individual deployments beginning throughout the duration of the projects.
• Volunteering Teams in High-Priority Areas is an action implemented in direct
management. Applications for funding under this action are expected to address one of
the policy priorities “relief for persons fleeing armed conflicts and other victims of
natural or man-made disasters”, "fostering positive learning experiences and outcomes
16for young people with fewer opportunities” and “promoting waste management and
recycling solutions”, as defined in Section 1.2.2.
• The European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps is an action implemented in
direct management which allows young people aged 18-35 to implement activities
designed to contribute to providing needs-based humanitarian aid aimed at preserving
life, preventing and alleviating human suffering and maintaining human dignity, and to
strengthen the capacity and resilience of vulnerable or disaster-affected communities.
In the context of the continuing war of aggression against Ukraine - supported activities
under this work programme could include for instance projects in support of refugees
in third countries which are not directly part of the armed conflict but are affected by
the resulting flows of refugees. Projects with volunteering activities in Ukraine itself,
supporting for example reconstruction, would also be eligible, subject to the armed
conflict having ceased by that time and the safety and security conditions allowing.
1.3.2. Solidarity projects
Solidarity projects aim to further foster the inclusiveness of the Corps and empower young
people to address unmet societal challenges. They consist of bottom-up, solidarity-related
activities, for a period of up to 12 months and are set up and carried out by groups of at least
five Corps participants, addressing key challenges in their communities while presenting clear
European added value. Such projects must not substitute traineeships and/or jobs.
Main actions planned for 2025
Under the general call for proposals, the Commission is planning to create opportunities for
young people under the solidarity projects action. Awarded projects are expected to start in the
course of 2025 or at the beginning of 2026.
1.3.3. Networking activities
Networking activities are national or transnational activities to support the Corps in fulfilling
its objectives and priorities. This should be achieved by helping organisations to offer quality
projects to an increasing number of participants, attracting newcomers - both young people and
participating organisations - and providing opportunities to give feedback on solidarity-related
activities. Such networking activities may also contribute to exchange of experiences and
strengthening the sense of belonging among the individuals and entities participating in the
Corps and thus support its wider positive impact.
Networking activities can consist of training, support and contact seminars, exchange of
practices, establishment of alumni networks and post-placement guidance, evaluation and
evidence-based analysis of results and impact. At direct management level, networking
activities will include awareness raising activities and events, consultation fora, exchanges of
practices and networking for participants and organisations prior to, during and after their
participation, with a view to sustaining the spirit of solidarity and inspiring others.
17Main actions planned for 2025
In 2025, the supported networking activities will include: organisation of trainings, support and
contact seminars for potential participating organisations and participants; thematic activities
to raise awareness and exchange of practices linked to the objectives, priority target groups and
themes of the Programme; establishing and implementing community-building networks,
alumni networks and post-placement guidance and support; evaluation and evidence-based
analysis of results and impact.
Note: In addition to organising the networking activities described above, specific training for
organisations and young persons involved in solidarity-related activities will be provided
through the training and evaluation cycle for participants (i.e. young people) and participating
organisations. Preparatory visits and complementary activities will also be supported in
conjunction with volunteering and activities by volunteering teams.
1.3.4. Quality and support measures
The Corps aims to provide high-quality solidarity-related activities. Therefore, the following
quality and support measures will be implemented:
• measures to ensure the quality and accessibility of volunteering or solidarity projects and
equal opportunities for all young people in participating countries, including by taking
into account the specific circumstances of participants in rural, remote, peripheral and
less developed areas, outermost regions and oversea countries and territories. This
includes offline and online training, language support, administrative support for
participants and participating organisations, insurance, and support before and, where
necessary, after the solidarity activity. It also includes the further use of Youthpass, which
identifies and documents the competences acquired during solidarity-related activities;
• the development and maintenance of quality labels for entities willing to participate in
providing volunteering opportunities for the Corps, to ensure compliance with the
principles and requirements of the Corps;
• the activities of the European Solidarity Corps Resource Centre, which support and raise
the implementation quality of the Corps’ actions and address potential obstacles, with a
view to ensuring a smooth and balanced experience for all participants and enhancing the
validation of their learning outcomes. To take advantage of mutual overlaps in areas of
common interest such as inclusion and diversity, the activities of the European Solidarity
Corps Resource Centre will be complemented by the activities of the SALTO Resource
Centres, financed jointly with the Erasmus+ programme;
• the establishment, maintenance and updating of the European Solidarity Corps Portal and
other relevant online services, as well as the necessary IT support systems and web-based
tools, taking into account the need to overcome the digital divide.
Main actions planned for 2025
In 2025, the 5th year of implementation of the 2021-2027 European Solidarity Corps, the
quality and support measures will include the following actions:
18• Quality Label: a Quality Label system is in place to ensure that participating
organisations comply with the principles and requirements of the European Solidarity
Corps regarding their responsibilities during all project stages. In general (with the
exception of individuals or organisations participating in solidarity projects), obtaining
a Quality Label is a prerequisite for an organisation to participate in any activities
supported by the Corps although it will not automatically lead to funding. The type of
Quality Label awarded will depend on the role an organisation wishes to perform in a
project: acting as a host organisation and/or a support organisation.
• At indirect management level, since 2021 there has been a new quality label process,
which enables easier access to funding for applicants. A new type of Quality Label was
introduced, the Quality Label for lead organisations. As a result, the process of applying
for grants was significantly streamlined, allowing organisations to spend less energy
and resources at application stage and instead enabling them to focus on the quality of
the activities and implementation. The application process will be managed by the
National Agencies.
• At direct management level, EACEA will continue to manage the application process
for the Quality Label for humanitarian aid volunteering. The procedure consists in
validating the capacity of applicant organisations to safely engage young volunteers in
humanitarian aid activities and certifying that they comply with the European Solidarity
Corps programme quality standards.
• Insurance: complementary insurance will be offered to cover insurance-related
expenses for participants in cross-border solidarity-related activities38 that are not
already covered by the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or other insurance
schemes in which participants may be enrolled. Obtaining the EHIC prior to departure
is mandatory in all cases, except in those where obtaining it proves impossible (due to
national rules) or when it requires payment from the participant. Where the EHIC cannot
be obtained for these reasons, primary coverage insurance may be proposed based upon
due justification. A comprehensive primary coverage insurance is offered to participants
under the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps39.
• Certificate: at the end of the activity, participants will receive a certificate of
participation, which must be issued by the organisation coordinating or providing the
activity. To support the impact of European Solidarity Corps activities on the personal,
educational, social, civic and professional development of participants, the competences
(combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes) that are the non-formal and informal
learning outcomes of these activities will be identified and documented, on a voluntary
basis. For this, EU-level tools such as Youthpass and Europass can be used, in
accordance with the specificities of the Corps’ activities and national circumstances.
Use of the Youthpass process and the certificate that identifies and documents non-
formal and informal learning outcomes will be further developed for the Corps, and will
be promoted and offered to participants (on a voluntary basis) and participating
organisations (mandatory, insofar as the participant requests it).
• Language learning opportunities: participants in solidarity activities will benefit from
online assessment and training through the fully revamped Online Language Support
(OLS) tool. The tool aims to give users the possibility to choose the languages they want
38 With the exception of the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps
39 Except where activities of the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps take place in a country/countries where EHIC applies.
19to study, as well as their main points of interest (learn more vocabulary, practice
grammar, oral practice, etc.). To a certain extent, basic language online activities may
also be made available for the benefit of the general public. Grants may be awarded to
offer learning opportunities regarding languages and/or levels not covered by the OLS
or to cater for specific needs of participants40.
• General online training: open access training is available for young people registered
in the European Solidarity Corps Portal and consists of a general induction course and
a range of specific courses. It is focused on issues such as the missions of the Corps,
ethics, integrity, roles and responsibilities of the participants, EU values, intercultural
awareness, insurance, health and safety, etc.41
• Training for candidate volunteers of the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid
Corps: Apart from general online training for all young people registered in the
European Solidarity Corps Portal, specific preparatory training (online and face-to-face)
is provided to young people intending to participate in the European Voluntary
Humanitarian Aid Corps. In order to be ready to contribute to supporting humanitarian
aid operations in non-EU countries, candidate volunteers should be adequately prepared
before starting their volunteering activity. Preparatory training for volunteers in
humanitarian aid activities aims to improve their level of preparedness and specific
knowledge about the action.
• European Youth Card: participants will be offered a Youth Card, which allows its
holders to benefit from reduced fares when purchasing certain goods or services. The
granting of this card to the participants as an additional service helps to promote Corps
and EU youth policy42.
• European Solidarity Corps and SALTO Resource Centre: the European Solidarity
Corps Resource Centre provides assistance to the implementing bodies, participating
organisations and stakeholders, to raise the quality and impact of the Corps’ actions and
activities and to enhance the identification and documentation of competences acquired
through solidarity-related activities. Existing services offered by the SALTO Resource
Centres under Erasmus+ will also continue to assist the Corps in line with their thematic
or regional areas of responsibility43.
• European Solidarity Corps Portal: the IT tools developed specifically for the Corps
between 2016 and 2020, particularly the European Solidarity Corps Portal and its
different modules and affiliated IT tools, will be further developed to improve the
experience for end-users. These developments will build on the role of the Portal as the
one-stop shop for interested individuals and organisations regarding, inter alia,
registration, identification and matching of profiles and opportunities, networking and
virtual exchanges. This includes involving future participants and alumni, online
training, certificates, language and post-placement support, as well as the development
of other functionalities to support the young people and organisations who wish to
participate, participate or have participated in solidarity activities, including in the field
of humanitarian aid. Links between the Portal and the IT tools supporting project
management will continue to be developed to further simplify management for

20beneficiaries. Similarly, interoperability between the Corps Portal and the Youthpass
and Europass IT environments will be developed.
• Support for IT developments: In 2025, the Commission will continue to focus on
improving the working environment (application forms, reporting forms, etc.) put in
place during the previous programming period, adapting it to newly introduced action
formats. The main objective will be to maximise synergies with existing Erasmus+ IT
tools, support the new IT landscape (including the transfer of information between
eGrant system and the Portal, where relevant), and carry out evolutionary maintenance.
This will allow the IT infrastructure to provide a seamless user experience, adapting and
properly aligning it to support all European Solidarity Corps processes, while ensuring
simplification and user-friendliness. The ESC app will be further developed to improve
access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal and facilitate exchange of experiences
and inspirational ideas between current, former and future participants. 44
• Final evaluation 2018-2020 and interim evaluation 2021-2027 (ongoing action
started in 2023): In accordance with the provisions of the legal base, Art 21(2), the
Commission shall carry out an interim evaluation of the Programme, no later than 31
December 2024. That interim evaluation needs to be accompanied by a final evaluation
of the 2018-2020 European Solidarity Corps Programme, which shall feed into the
interim evaluation. The final evaluation, which will assess the efficiency, effectiveness
and impact of the 2018-2020 programme and provide recommendations for the current
programme is carried out as an independent evaluation, using a framework service
contract. The results of the evaluation shall feed back into i.e. resource allocation
proposals in the following years as well as into the impact assessment for the future
programmes.
Note: In 2025, the European Solidarity Corps may contribute financially to the Commission’s
corporate communication, in accordance with Article 22(2) of the European Solidarity Corps
Regulation. This contribution will cover corporate communication of the EU’s political
priorities to the extent that they are related to the general objective of the Corps.

2.2.1. Grants and actions implemented through direct and indirect management
To achieve the objectives and policy priorities announced in Sections 1.1.1 and 1.2.2 of Part I
of this work programme, general and specific calls for proposals are published by the
Commission or by the Executive Agency in accordance with Article 189(1) of the Financial
Regulation.
Each year, after adoption of the financing decision, based on Article 110 of the Financial
Regulation, a general call for proposals is published. The general call for proposals for the
implementation of the European Solidarity Corps includes the Programme Guide. The
Programme Guide aims to assist all those interested in developing projects within the
Programme. It helps them understand the objectives and the actions of the Programme. It also
gives detailed information on what are the minimum requirements for applying and what level
of grant is offered. Finally, it informs about the grant selection procedure as well as the rules
applying to successful applicants that become beneficiaries of an EU grant. The Programme
Guide provides also detailed information as regards the eligibility, selection and award criteria
for each type of project to be implemented. The quality of the proposals will be assessed on the
basis of the award criteria published per action in the guide.
Actions will be implemented both in direct and indirect management. All actions implemented
through the National Agencies (marked as NA), are to be considered as indirect management.
Grants through direct management will be those awarded by EAC or EACEA.
Some grants will be awarded without a call for proposals in accordance with indents (c), (d)
and (f) of Article 195 of the Financial Regulation.
22The calls for proposals that will be published or launched to select actions for co-financing in
2025, as well as the grants awarded under specific conditions without issuing a call for
proposals, are specified further in Part II of this work programme.
For the beneficiaries of all grants awarded under the European Solidarity Corps, the following
selection criteria will apply:
Selection criteria
Organisations, institutions and groups applying for any grant under the European Solidarity
Corps, as detailed further in Part II of this work programme, will be assessed against the
following selection criteria:
• Financial capacity: applicants must have stable and sufficient sources of funding to
maintain their regular activity throughout the period during which the action is being
carried out or the year for which the grant is awarded, to participate in its funding. The
verification of financial capacity will not be done for public bodies, including Member
State organisations, public legal entities, institutions and organisations in the fields of
education and training, youth and sport that have received over 50% of their annual
revenue from public sources over the last two years and for international organisations.
• Operational capacity: applicants must have the necessary professional competences and
qualifications to carry out the proposed action. Applicants must have the know-how,
qualifications and resources to successfully implement the projects and contribute their
share (including sufficient experience in projects of comparable size and nature).
2.2.2. Procurement
This work programme also includes actions that will be implemented by public procurement
procedures (via calls for tenders or the use of service or framework contracts) (Article 164 of
the Financial Regulation). The amounts reserved, together with the indicative number of
contracts and the timeframe for launching the procurement procedures, are indicated in Table
2 in Part III, Section 2 of this work programme.
For actions implemented through framework contracts (FWC), in case existing FWC cannot be
used, the Commission will consider publishing calls for tender to award new FWC.
2.2.3. Experts and other actions
This work programme includes costs related to the experts involved in assessing requests for a
Quality Label or funding.
Insofar as participating organisations are concerned, a Quality Label process is in place for
applicants (under ‘quality and support measures’) to ensure the general quality framework.
Holding the relevant Quality Label is a pre-requisite to be eligible to receive a grant for most
solidarity-related activities45 and/or to participate in many other actions of the Corps.
45 With the exception of grants concerning solidarity projects, to which the obligation for applicants for funding to have a relevant Quality
Label does not apply.
232.3. SUPPORTED ACTIVITIES
2.3.1. Expected results of supported activities
In line with the general and specific objectives and in accordance with the monitoring and
evaluation framework46 of the European Solidarity Corps, the actions supported by the initiative
are expected to bring positive and long-lasting effects to the participants and participating
organisations involved, as well as the communities in which these actions take place.
For individual participants, solidarity-related activities supported in 2025, and any other
supported activities related to them (e.g. quality and support measures), are meant to produce
the main following outcomes:
• improved skills and competences for personal, educational, social, civic, cultural and
professional development;
• more active participation in democratic life and in society in general;
• enhanced employability and transition to the labour market;
• increased sense of initiative and social entrepreneurship;
• increased self-empowerment and self-esteem;
• improved foreign language competences;
• enhanced intercultural awareness;
• better awareness of the European project, its foundations, history, functioning and EU
values;
• increased motivation for further engagement in the solidarity sector;
• increased awareness of humanitarian aid-related themes and values.
Supported solidarity-related activities are also expected to produce the following outcomes on
participating organisations:
• increased capacity to operate at EU/international level;
• innovative and improved ways of operating towards their target groups;
• greater understanding and responsiveness to social, linguistic and cultural diversity;
• more modern, dynamic, committed and professional environment inside the
organisations.
For communities where the supported solidarity-related activities are implemented, the
following outcomes are expected:
46 Commission delegated Regulation {C(2023) 6085 final}
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52023SC0297
24• increased ability to address societal challenges;
• greater understanding and responsiveness to social, linguistic and cultural diversity;
• increased capacity building among local organisations and local communities in third
countries.
In the long run, the combined effect of supported solidarity-related activities is expected to have
an impact on the operations of a large number of stakeholders in participating countries.
Specifically in 2025 and in relation with the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, a number of
activities supported by the European Solidarity Corps will result in direct relief and improved
capacity of communities to address needs arising from the consequences of the aggression,
including refugee relief, assistance, support and integration.
2.3.2. Actions implemented under indirect management
This section of the work programme describes the actions implemented by the National
Agencies (NA) of the European Solidarity Corps Programme. The budget implementation tasks
will be entrusted to the National Agencies via the conclusion of Contribution Agreements under
indirect management mode in accordance with Articles 62 (1)(c), 110 (3)(f) and 157 (1) of the
Financial Regulation. The country distribution of the budget (i.e. amounts entrusted to National
Agencies in individual countries) is provided in Part III of this work programme.
The expected results for the actions described in this section are indicated in Section 2.3.1
above. More specific indications for these actions concerning 1) the main expected outputs, 2)
the implementation mode, 3) and the estimated amount available are indicated in the
programming tables in Part III, Section 2 of this work programme.

The financial envelope by country is indicated in table 3 of Part III.
Furthermore, in addition to implementing the budget foreseen in table 3, the European
Solidarity Corps will explore the possibility to continue the cooperation with the Horizon
Europe Programme in 2025, in order to facilitate a financial contribution of Horizon Europe to
Volunteering Projects. More specifically, the contribution of the Horizon Europe Programme
could be earmarked for Volunteering Projects supporting the EU Missions47 and their key
strategies.
47 Adaptation to Climate Change, Cancer, Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030, 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030, A Soil
Deal for Europe
25This action provides young people with the opportunity to contribute, with their motivation and
commitment, to the daily work of organisations active in solidarity-related fields by offering
them volunteering opportunities.
These volunteering opportunities can be offered through Volunteering Projects. Projects are
implemented through an appropriate mix of eligible activities, particularly individual
volunteering and activities by volunteering teams.
Individual volunteering is a solidarity-related activity carried out as a voluntary unpaid activity
for a period of up to 12 months. This provides young people with the opportunity to contribute
to the daily work of organisations engaged in solidarity-related activities to benefit the
communities in which the activities are carried out. Such volunteering must not substitute
traineeships and/or jobs and must be based on a written volunteering agreement.
Activities by volunteering teams are solidarity-related activities allowing teams of European
Solidarity Corps participants to volunteer together for a period between 2 weeks and 2 months.
Such solidarity-related activities could contribute especially to the inclusion of young people
with fewer opportunities in the Corps and/or be justified due to the specific aims of the
solidarity-related activities.
Individual volunteering and/or activities by volunteering teams aim to:
• address clearly defined unmet societal challenges;
• promote solidarity across Member States;
• enable the young volunteer(s) to gain skills and competences which are useful for their
personal, educational, social and professional development;
• provide tangible benefits to the communities within which the activities are carried out;
• ensure a direct contact between the participant and the beneficiaries of the solidarity-
related activities, to enable the young volunteer to gain skills that are useful for their
educational and social development;
• reach out to young people with fewer opportunities, including young persons with
disabilities, refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, as well as members of vulnerable
groups, ethnic minorities and vulnerable communities;
• respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of
the Rights of the Child (2017) and in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities;
• promote diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue - and the EU values of
human dignity, freedom, equality and respect for human rights, including the rights of
26persons belonging to minorities - as well as projects enhancing media literacy, critical
thinking and a sense of initiative among young people;
• reinforce the capacities and international scope of the participating organisations;
• raise participants’ awareness and understanding of other cultures and countries, offering
them the opportunity to build networks of international contacts, to actively participate
in society and to develop a sense of European citizenship and identity.
In line with the conditions of the call for proposals, and depending on the format of activities
for which financial support is requested (and without prejudice to the definition of individual
eligible activities), supported activities may be:
• cross-border activities, i.e. activities taking place in a different country to the country of
origin of the participant(s); or
• in-country activities, e.g. to encourage and facilitate the participation of young people
with fewer opportunities, to provide opportunities where national schemes do not exist,
or to cater for priorities identified at European level within the framework of the
European Solidarity Corps initiative.
Types of applicants targeted by this action: any public or private entity, whether non-profit or
profit making, local, regional, national or international, legally established in an EU Member
State, a third country associated to the Programme or international organisations holding a valid
Quality Label for lead organisation at the grant application deadline. Participating organisations
may be from an EU Member State or third country associated to the Progamme and may also
be from a third country not associated to the Programme48 and must hold a valid Quality Label
for host and/or support role at the latest at the start of the activities.
Only organisations holding a Quality Label for lead organisations may apply and receive grants
to implement projects focused on volunteering opportunities.
Projects with exclusively in-country volunteering activities must involve at least one Quality
Label organisation. Projects including individual cross-border volunteering activities must
involve a Quality Label host organisation, and at least one Quality Label support organisation
from each of the countries where the participants are legally residing. Volunteering teams
require at least one (host or support) Quality Label organisation.
Against this background, the eligibility of legal entities from third countries not associated to
the Programme, as foreseen by Article 14.2 of the European Solidarity Corps Regulation, is in
the Union’s interest.

27The financial envelope by country is indicated in Table 3 of Part III.
Solidarity projects are non-profit solidarity activities, for a period of up to 12 months, that are
set up and carried out by groups of at least five Corps participants, to address key challenges in
their communities while presenting clear European added value. Such solidarity projects must
not substitute traineeships and/or jobs.
Projects under this action promote a spirit of initiative, social commitment and active
citizenship and mainly aim to:
• provide young people with easily accessible opportunities to engage in solidarity-related
activities;
• foster active participation and social commitment by young people carrying out the
project;
• help address concrete, unmet societal challenges and strengthen communities;
• help enhance the personal, educational, social and civic development of young people;
• have an impact on the local community by addressing local issues or common
challenges and developing local opportunities, particularly in communities located in
rural, isolated or marginalised areas and border regions, including the EU outermost
regions;
• promote environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among young people
implementing the project and other participants in project activities, raising their
awareness of the importance of acting to reduce or compensate for the environmental
footprint of activities;
• respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of
the Rights of the Child (2017) and in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities.
Type of applicants targeted by this action: groups of minimum 5 young people aged between
18 and 30 years old, who are legally residing in one and the same EU Member State or a third
country associated to the Programme and have registered themselves in the European Solidarity
Corps Portal. Any public or private body, legally established in an EU Member State or third
country associated to the Programme, may apply on behalf of the group that will implement the
project.

2.3.2.2 Other actions under indirect management
a) Quality Label (indirect management)
Index reference in budget table (WPI): 5.14
A Quality Label process is in place to ensure a general quality framework for most activities
(in practice: volunteering, activities by volunteering teams, i.e. any projects involving one or
28more of these activities) that may be carried out with the support of the European Solidarity
Corps. Obtaining a Quality Label is a pre-condition for organisations to:
• apply for funding;
• participate in the volunteering activities supported under the European Solidarity Corps.
There are three types of Quality Label, depending on the role(s) that the organisation wishes to
play in the project:
• Host role;
• Support role;
• Quality Label for Lead organisations.
Award of a Quality Label for host or support role does not provide automatic access to funding.
The Quality Label will be valid for the duration of the programming period (2021-2027) and
subject to periodical reassessment.
Type of applicants targeted by this action: for the Quality Label for lead, host and support
organisations, any public or private entity, whether non-profit or profit making, local, regional,
national or international, legally established in an EU Member State or a third country
associated to the Programme or any international organisation. They can have a host or support
role or the combination of both. Organisations from a third country not associated to the
Programme can have either a host or support role or both.
The participation in a host and/or support role of legal entities from third countries not
associated to the Programme, as foreseen by Article 14.2 of the European Solidarity Corps
Regulation, is in the Union’s interest.

b) Transnational and national Networking Activities
Index reference in budget table (WPI): 4.10
The Networking Activities aim to bring added value and increased quality to the overall
implementation of the European Solidarity Corps and contribute to increasing its impact at
systemic level.
In 2025, Networking Activities consist of transnational and national:
29• training, support and contact seminars for potential organisations and participants,
particularly a networking activities seminar to exchange practices and develop quality
in Networking Activities;
• thematic activities to raise awareness and exchanges of practices linked to the
objectives, priority target groups and themes of the Programme;
• establishment and implementation of alumni networks and post-placement guidance and
support;
• evaluation and evidence-based analysis of results and impact.
Networking Activities are crucial support activities targeting potential beneficiaries and
potential participants, practitioners and stakeholders of the European Solidarity Corps
Programme. Through Networking Activities, the National Agencies provide trainings, thematic
and research activities, support and contact seminars, which are key to ensure quality
implementation of the Programme and to build closer links with the relevant elements of policy
development.

c) Activities of the European Solidarity Corps Resource Centres
Index reference in budget table (WPI): 5.50
The Resource Centres are part of the quality and support measures mentioned in the Regulation
establishing the European Solidarity Corps. They constitute additional entrusted tasks to be
performed by designated National Agencies to support the development, implementation and
quality of actions under the European Solidarity Corps. The European Solidarity Corps benefits
from the already well-established network of Resources Centres under the Erasmus+
programme and a dedicated European Solidarity Corps Resource Centre.
SALTO-YOUTH Resource Centres are structures mainly supported through the Erasmus+
Programme aiming to improve the quality of projects in the field of youth. Through their
thematic (participation, information, inclusion, diversity, training and recognition) or
geographical (Eastern Partnership countries and Russia, Southern Mediterranean, Western
Balkans) focus, they provide resources, information and training in specific areas for National
Agencies and other actors involved in the youth field and foster the recognition of non-formal
and informal learning. The SALTO resource centres also offer support and develop trainings,
tools and resources for the European Solidarity Corps.
The European Solidarity Corps Resource Centre assists the implementing bodies, participating
organisations and young people taking part in the European Solidarity Corps, as well as
stakeholders, to raise the quality and impact of its implementation in all participating countries,
and to enhance the identification and documentation of competences acquired through the
activities.
30Support for the European Solidarity Resource Centres is identified in Article 5(2)(d) of the
European Solidarity Corps Regulation.
The budget implementation tasks will be entrusted to National Agencies via the conclusion of
Contribution Agreements under indirect management mode in accordance with Article 62
(1)(c), 110 (3)(f), 154 and 157 (1) of the Financial Regulation.

d) Specific training for participants, organisations and mentors in solidarity-related activities
(training and evaluation cycle; indirect management)
Index reference in budget table (WPI): 5.40
The training aims to improve the level of preparedness of young people participating in cross-
border solidarity-related activities and consists of the following modules/activities:
• pre-departure training for volunteers ensures that, by the time they leave, participants
are adequately prepared for their upcoming activities and equipped with practical and
technical information on matters such as insurance, visa, pocket money and working
hours, etc.
• on-arrival training introduces the volunteers to the host country, helps to adapt to
cultural and personal challenges and allows getting to know each other and build a
network.
• mid-term evaluation allows participants in long-term volunteering to assess their
experience up to that point and to reflect on the activities, role and support of the host
organisation and on their own contribution.
• annual event is an opportunity to bring together former, current and potential
participants.
The training also supports organisations with an objective to provide training to newly awarded
Quality Label organisations on the core features of the Programme.
The training provides mentors with guidance on how to offer support and reinforced mentorship
to the participants involved in volunteering activities.
The budget implementation tasks will be entrusted to National Agencies via the conclusion of

a) Volunteering Teams in High-Priority Areas49
Index references in budget table (WPI): 1.30
This action provides young people with the opportunity to contribute, with their motivation and
commitment, to the daily work of organisations active in solidarity-related fields by offering
them volunteering opportunities.
These volunteering opportunities will be offered through Volunteering Teams in High-Priority
Areas. Activities by volunteering teams are solidarity-related activities allowing teams of
European Solidarity Corps participants to volunteer together for a period between 2 weeks and
2 months. Such solidarity-related activities are justified due to their specific aims.
Activities by volunteering teams in high-priority areas will aim to:
• address clearly defined unmet societal challenges in the area of either “relief for persons
fleeing armed conflicts and other victims of natural or man-made disasters” or
49 In 2025 these areas correspond to the policy priorities of “relief for persons fleeing armed conflicts and other victims of natural or man-
made disasters”, "fostering positive learning experiences and outcomes for young people with fewer opportunities” and “promoting
waste management and recycling solutions” , as defined in Section 1.2.2.
32""fostering positive learning experiences and outcomes for young people with fewer
opportunities”, as defined in Section 1.2.2;
• promote solidarity across the participating countries;
• enable the young volunteer(s) to gain skills and competences which are useful for their
personal, educational, social and professional development;
• provide tangible benefits to the communities within which the activities are carried out;
• ensure a direct contact between the participant and the beneficiaries of the solidarity-
related activities, to enable the young volunteer to gain skills that are useful for their
educational and social development;
• reach out to young people with fewer opportunities, including refugees, asylum seekers
and migrants, as well as members of vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities and vulnerable
communities;
• promote diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue - and the EU values of
human dignity, freedom, equality and respect for human rights, including the rights of
persons belonging to minorities - as well as projects enhancing media literacy, critical
thinking and a sense of initiative among young people;
• respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of
the Rights of the Child (2017) and in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities;
• reinforce the capacities and international scope of the participating organisations;
• raise participants’ awareness and understanding of other cultures and countries, offering
them the opportunity to build networks of international contacts, to actively participate
in society and to develop a sense of European citizenship and identity.
In line with the conditions of the call for proposals, and depending on the format of activities
for which financial support is requested (and without prejudice to the definition of individual
eligible activities), supported activities may be:
• cross-border activities, i.e. activities taking place in a different country to the country of
origin of the participant(s); or
• in-country activities, e.g. to encourage and facilitate the participation of young people
with fewer opportunities, to provide opportunities where national schemes do not exist,
or to cater for priorities identified at European level within the framework of the
European Solidarity Corps initiative.
Types of applicants targeted by this action: any public or private entity, whether non-profit or
profit making, local, regional, national or international, legally established in an EU Member
State, a third country associated to the Programme or international organisations holding a valid

b) European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps
Index references in budget table (WPI): 2.00
This action provides young people aged 18 to 35 years old with the opportunity to participate
in volunteering activities, aiming at supporting humanitarian aid operations. Subject to an end
to the ongoing war and to adequate guarantees of safety and security of the volunteers, this
could include supporting such operations in the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and
deploying young volunteers in the rebuilding in Ukraine. These activities should:
• contribute to a needs-based humanitarian response and be guided by the European
Consensus on Humanitarian Aid51. International humanitarian law and human rights law
should be promoted;
• be carried out in compliance with the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality,
impartiality and independence, as well as with the '‘do no significant harm’' principle;
• respond to the humanitarian needs of local communities identified in cooperation with
humanitarian and other relevant partners within the hosting country or region;
• be planned on the basis of risk assessments and undertaken in a way that ensures that
there is a high level of safety and security for volunteers;
• where relevant, facilitate the transition from the humanitarian response to long-term
sustainable and inclusive development;
• facilitate the active involvement of local staff and volunteers from the countries and
communities where they are implemented;
• respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of
the Rights of the Child (2017) and in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities;
• strive to contribute to enhanced effectiveness and efficiency of the EU humanitarian aid,
in line with the Good Humanitarian Donorship principles;
51 https://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/consensus_en.pdf
34• contribute to an adequate humanitarian response strengthening the gender perspective
in Union humanitarian aid policy, promoting adequate humanitarian responses to the
specific needs of women and men of all ages and seek to involve women and groups
and networks of women. These actions should take into account the needs and capacities
of those in the most vulnerable situations, including women and children, and those
most at risk, e.g. members of vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities and vulnerable
communities ;
• contribute to efforts to strengthen local preparedness or the response to humanitarian
crises.
In practice, the following activities are supported under the European Voluntary Humanitarian
Aid Corps:
• Individual volunteering implementing a solidarity activity in the field of humanitarian
aid that can be “long term”, with a duration of 2 to 12 months.
• Volunteering teams implementing a solidarity activity in the field of humanitarian aid
of 5 to 40 participants coming from at least two different countries who volunteer
together for a period between 2 weeks and 2 months.
• Preparatory meetings (before the deployment) and complementary activities (in parallel
to the volunteering activity) as side activities aiming at ensuring high quality and
increased impact at local/regional level.
Type of applicants targeted for a support role by this action: any public or private entity,
whether non-profit or profit making, local, regional, national or international, legally
established in an EU Member State, a third country associated to the Programme or
international organisations. Participating organisations (host role) must be based in a third
country not associated to the Programme where humanitarian aid activities and operations take
place and where there are no ongoing international or non-international armed conflicts. All
participating organisations must hold a valid Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid volunteering
at the application deadline and for the entire duration of the project. Eligible participating
organisations are expected to form a consortium.
The participation of legal entities from third countries not associated to the Programme in a
host role for humanitarian volunteering is indispensable to implement this action, therefore it
is in the Union’s interest as foreseen by Article 14.2 of the European Solidarity Corps
Regulation.

European Solidarity Corps participants in activities entailing mobility are offered a Youth Card,
which allows its holders to benefit from reduced fares when purchasing certain goods or
services subject to availability in participating countries. The granting of this card is provided
as an additional service to participants. It also contributes to the promotion of the European
Solidarity Corps and of EU youth policy by providing young people access to quality youth
information through the organisation of awards ceremonies and events.
The objective is to renew the agreement between the Commission and the EYCA (European
Youth Card Association), the only body that issues such a Youth Card and thus has a de facto
monopoly within the meaning of Article 195 (c) of the Financial Regulation with a two-years
grant, covering 2025 and 2026.

b) European Solidarity Corps Insurance
Index reference in budget table (WPI): 5.20
The European Solidarity Corps insurance scheme aims to cover the risks run by the young
people participating in Corps activities as volunteers in cross-border activities. Every
participant must be enrolled in the European Solidarity Corps Insurance scheme foreseen by
the European Solidarity Corps Programme. For participants in solidarity-related activities’
strand, the offered insurance should complement coverage by the EHIC and/or national social
security systems and other insurance schemes in which participants may be enrolled. Those
participants who are not eligible for the EHIC will be entitled to receive full coverage through
the insurance provided by the European Commission. In cases in which obtaining the EHIC
proves impossible (due to national rules), or when it requires the participant to pay, primary
coverage insurance may be proposed based upon due justification. National Agencies must
promote the fact that being in possession of an EHIC (when possible) and European Solidarity
Corps Insurance is mandatory for all participants in cross-border activities.
A comprehensive primary coverage insurance is offered to participants under the European
Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps52.
The organisations are responsible for the enrolment of the participant(s) to the insurance
scheme. This enrolment must be done before the departure of the participant(s) and cover the
duration of the activity.
The multiannual framework contract in place following a procurement procedure provides an
insurance scheme for participants in European Solidarity Corps projects selected in the
programming period (2021-2027), including volunteers in humanitarian aid activities.

The European Solidarity Corps Portal, which is integrated into the European Youth Portal,
offers information on solidarity-related opportunities across Europe and beyond. It provides
young people with information about the Corps and access to organisations which have received
the Quality Label and are registered in the Portal. Furthermore, the Portal and its integrated
tools (PASS) enable registered organisations (holders of the Quality Label) to search for and
contact suitable candidates for volunteering activities that they wish to offer.
The Portal allows young people to follow online training, to access other services and,
importantly, to build a community of young people sharing the common European values. The
Portal will be integrated into all front- and back-end processes of the Corps. To further improve
access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal and facilitate exchange of experiences and
inspirational ideas between current, former and future participants, the existing mobile
application will be further developed and enhanced with new features.

the EU-Budget.
The overall allocation of funds to the Programme is established by Article 11 of the Regulation.
It should be noted, however, that in line with the Regulation, these percentages of the total
budget are fixed for the entire programming period 2021-2027. Therefore, for a given year of
implementation, they do not need to be respected in full (e.g. because of reprogramming or a
change in political priorities). However, the trend will have to be respected for the overall
duration of the Programme.

443.3. BREAKDOWN BY COUNTRY OF THE FUNDS ALLOCATED TO THE NATIONAL
AGENCIES
The 4 criteria used for the allocation of funds for the EU contribution to grant support indirectly
managed by the National Agencies are the following:
a) Country Population;
b) Cost of Living;
c) Distance between capitals;
d) Performance.
The relative weight of the criteria is calculated as follows:
Minimum allocation of 20% of the budget for each action is applied. The criteria a) to c) account
for the allocation of 70% of funds. The criterion of past performance d) accounts for the
remaining 10%. Therefore, the country allocation and, more specifically, the level of
contribution and grant agreements is based on the figures resulting from the above-mentioned
criteria.
In order to guarantee that there are no excessive imbalances in the annual budget allocated to
countries from one year to another, a correction mechanism is applied to the allocations
resulting from the pure application of the above-mentioned criteria.

WORK PACKAGES
n
Work packages
,
This section concerns a detailed description of the project activities. e
Group your activities into work packages. A work package means a major sub-division of the project. For each work package, enter an objective (expected outcome) and list the activities,
milestones and deliverables that belong to it. The grouping should bel logical and guided by identifiable outputs.
p
Projects should normally have a minimum of 2 work packages. WP1 should cover the management and coordination activities (meetings, coordination, project monitoring and evaluation, financial
management, progress reports, etc) and all the activities which are cross-cutting and therefore difficult to assign to another specific work package (do not try splitting these activities across
m
different work packages). WP2 and further WPs should be used for the other project activities. You can create as many work packages as needed by copying WP1.
Enter each activity/milestone/output/outcome/deliverable only once (under one work package).
Ensure consistence with the detailed budget
tablea
/calculator (if applicable).

Activities and division of work (WP description)
t
Provide a concise overview of the work (planned tasks). Be specific and give a short name and number for each task.
Show who is participating in each task: Coordinator (COO), Beneficiaries (BEN), Affiliated Entities (AE), Associated Partners (AP), and otherse indicating in bold the task leader.
l
Milestones and deliverables (outputs/outcomes) p
Milestones are control points in the project that help to chart progress (e.g. completion of a key deliverable allowing the next phase of the work to begin). Use them only for major outputs in
m
complex projects, otherwise leave the section empty. Please limit the number of milestones by work package.
Means of verification are how you intend to prove that a milestone has been reached. If appropriate, you can also refer to indicators.
Deliverables are project outputs which are submitted to show project progress (any format). Refer only to major outputs o. Do not include minor sub-items, internal working papers, meeting minutes,
etc. Limit the number of deliverables to max 10-15 for the entire project. You may be asked to further reduce the number during grant preparation.
For deliverables such as meetings, events, seminars, trainings, workshops, webinars, conferences, etc., enterc each deliverable separately and provide the following in the 'Description' field:
invitation, agenda, signed presence list, target group, number of estimated participants, duration of the event, report of the event, training material package, presentations, evaluation report,
feedback questionnaire.
o
For deliverables such as manuals, toolkits, guides, reports, leaflets, brochures, training materials etc., add in the ‘Description’ field: format (electronic or printed), language(s), approximate number
of pages and estimated number of copies of publications (if any).
t
For each deliverable you will have to indicate a due month by when you commit to upload it in the Portal. The due month of the deliverable cannot be outside the duration of the work package and
must be in line with the timeline provided below. Month 1 marks the start of the project and all dea dlines should be related to this starting date.

5EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
IMPORTANT NOTICE
The AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement is a user guide that aims to explain to applicants and
beneficiaries the EU Model Grant Agreements for the EU funding programmes 2021-2027.
Programme specificities are reflected in this document as examples — in so far as they are accepted
as mainstream solutions that can be used by several EU programmes.
The purpose of this document is to help users understand and interpret their Grant Agreements
(GAs). By avoiding technical vocabulary, legal references and jargon, it seeks to help readers find
answers to the practical questions they may come across when setting-up or implementing their
projects.
In the same spirit, the document’s structure mirrors that of the EU Model Grant Agreements (MGAs).
It explains each MGA Article and includes examples where appropriate.
Since all EU MGAs are derived from the same basic model (EU General Model Grant Agreement), the
AGA focuses mainly on this model. Other types of grants will be gradually covered by separate
guidance, in order to be able to cover all specificities, not only the specific explanations on the
contractual text.
Our approach
1. The text of the article appears in a grey text box — to differentiate it from the annotations.
The concepts that are annotated are in bold and underlined.
The annotations to the article are immediately underneath.
Long articles are split into different parts, so the annotations can be placed below the
relevant parts.
Examples are in green.
Lists are in red.
Specific cases and exceptions are in orange.
Programme-specific cases are in purple.
New explanations (compared to the last AGA update) will be marked with: (as from V1.0;
not applicable for the draft versions)
New rules that do not apply to all signed Grant Agreements (but instead only to those signed
after a certain version, e.g. version 3.0), will be marked with: and
2. As the AGA intends to be comprehensive, it will cover all possible options envisaged in the
EU MGAs.
Many of these options may not be relevant to your grant (and will not appear in the Grant
Agreement you sign, or will be marked ‘not applicable’). The chosen options will be
summarised in the Data Sheet of your Grant Agreement.
Versioning
The AGA will be managed as a stable corporate document with versions. Older versions will be
accessible through hyperlinks in the History of Changes table.
Other information
The AGA is limited to the provisions of the EU Model Grant Agreements. For a more general
overview of how EU grants work, see the Online Manual and the programme-specific guidance
published in the Funding & Tenders Portal Reference Documents.
The Portal Reference Documents also contain a comprehensive list of all other reference documents,
for each EU programme (including legislation, work programme and templates).
Terms are explained in the Funding & Tenders Portal Glossary.

I. EU GENERAL MODEL GRANT AGREEMENT (GENERAL
MGA)
INTRODUCTION
General > EU grants regulatory framework
1. EU Regulatory framework for funding programmes — EU Financial Regulation —
EU Programme Regulations — EU grant agreements
EU grants are given through sui generis private law contractual arrangements called ‘EU
grant agreements’.
They govern the relationship between the EU granting authorities and the
beneficiaries/participants in EU grants and set out the respective rules and obligations
concerning the funding and the implementation and of the EU projects.
The grant agreements are embedded in the EU regulatory framework, i.e. EU Financial
Regulation and the sectoral regulations setting up the funding programmes (‘basic acts’ or
‘programme regulations’).
The EU Financial Regulation codifies the procedures for awarding EU funding; the sectoral
regulations contain additional, programme-specific rules on the objectives of each programme,
eligibility, selection procedures, etc.
In September 2024, the Financial Regulation 2018/1046 was recast and replaced by the
Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
The new Regulation 2024/2509 applies to all EU calls for proposals opening as from 30
September 2024.
In addition, the EU grant agreements have been updated and will be used as from mid 2025.
The update has however very limited impact (mainly cross-references to the Financial
Regulation that had to be replaced and a clarification regarding the failure to cooperate with
checks, reviews, audits and investigations as a breach of contract in Articles 28, 30, 31 and 32
of the grant agreements — which was in substance already covered by these provisions also
before the update).
The MGA and AGA have been updated to the new numbering. For your convenience, new
footnotes have been added with references to the old Financial Regulation.
General > Scope – Types of actions – Types of grant agreements?
2. Background and scope — What types of actions are funded by EU grants —
Types of grant agreements
The EU uses different types of grants in its funding programmes (‘programmes’). The EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509 distinguishes between 2 main types: action grants (AG) and
operating grants (OG)1.
In addition, there are simplified grant types which pay only lump sums (LS) or unit costs
(UN)2.
1 See Article 183(2) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23
September 2024 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union (recast) (‘EU Financial
Regulation’) (OJ L, 2024/2509, 26.9.2024) [old Financial Regulation: Article 180(2) Regulation (EU, Euratom)
2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the
general budget of the Union (‘EU Financial Regulation’) (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1).]
10EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Grants are usually given through open calls for proposals, but may sometimes also be
awarded directly without a call. They can be multi- or mono-beneficiary actions.
The General Model Grant Agreement (General MGA) is the grant agreement for EU action
grants (AG), i.e. grants that are funded based on the actual costs incurred by the
beneficiaries.
For guidance on other types of grants, see How to manage your lump sum grants.
This new General MGA has been introduced by the European Commission for the new
generation of programmes under the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027
(new for 2021-2027), in order to ensure simpler and more coherent provisions for all EU
programmes. Programme-specific provisions are grouped in Article 6 and Annex 5; the rest of
the provisions are the same for all programmes.
The new AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement reflects this new structure. Moreover, since a
wide range of programmes is now using the European Commission eGrants IT tools (EU
Funding & Tenders Portal; also called ‘Portal’), the annotations focus on grants managed
through these IT tools. For other aspects, the AGA applies to grant agreements managed
outside these tools (paper).
General > How to set up your project — Consortium composition and roles and responsibilities
3. How to set up your project — Consortium composition and roles and
responsibilities
Capacity to successfully carry out the project:
The Financial Regulation requires that beneficiaries must have the technical and financial
resources needed to carry out their projects (‘operational and financial capacity’)3.
This assessment is project-specific (and the outcome may accordingly vary between calls,
depending on the complexity and nature of the action). What will be checked is if the
participants have sufficient operational and financial capacity to carry out the proposed
action.
The sufficient capacity must be demonstrated in the proposal and be available at the moment
of the implementation of the work (i.e. not necessarily already at the moment of submitting
the proposal or signing the GA, but at least when the work starts). In order to give sufficient
assurance, proposals should show how the resources will be made available when they are
needed.
Examples (acceptable):
1. For an innovative technology call, a Start-up company with no resources at the time of proposal
submission, but with a credible business plan described in the application.
2. SME which, if it gets the grant, plans to double its capacity/staff.
Examples (not acceptable):
1. Consultancy company which submits a proposal where the majority of the work is
subcontracted.
2 See Article 183(3) and 125 Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 180(3) and 125
Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
3 See Article 201 Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 198 Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
11EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. For a call for distribution of support goods in an immediate crisis situation, a start-up with no
experience and no resources at the time of proposal submission.
Different roles in the GA:
Ideally, the project work should be done by the beneficiaries and their affiliated entities
themselves, but if needed, they may involve other partners and rely on outside resources
(purchase new equipment, goods, works or services, subcontract a part of the work or
involve associated partners, etc).
Legally speaking, it is the beneficiaries that remain fully responsible towards the granting
authority (since they are the ones that have signed the Grant Agreement (GA)). For all the other
participants, the obligations under the Grant Agreement are indirect, meaning that the
beneficiaries must ensure that the activities of the other participants are in line with the Grant
Agreement. In case of non-compliance, the granting authority will turn to the beneficiaries to
enforce their obligations.
Depending on the programme and on the type of action, entities can participate in various
roles: as coordinator, beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, in-kind
contributors, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP).
Each role is linked to a set of conditions and legal rights and obligations that are relatively rigid.
Make sure that you chose the appropriate role for everyone. Having the wrong role can cause a
lot of problems later on.
Coordinator vs other beneficiaries
The coordinator is the participant that will be the central contact point (for the granting
authority) and represent the consortium (towards the granting authority). The other
beneficiaries are the other entities that participate as beneficiaries (i.e. also sign the grant).
For mono-beneficiary grants, the mono-beneficiary also has the coordinator role.
Beneficiaries vs affiliated entities
Affiliated entities (new for 2021-2027; in some programmes previously called ‘linked third
parties’) are in practice treated largely like beneficiaries (except that — formally speaking —
they do NOT sign the Grant Agreement).
They must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding as the beneficiaries and
need to have a validated participant identification code (PIC) in the Portal Participant
Register. Annotations in this AGA which refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to affiliated
entities (just like the provisions of the MGA themselves; see also MGA Preamble).
More details on participant registration and PICs are explained in the Online Manual >
Participant Register > Registration and validation of your organisation on the Funding & Tenders
Portal.
Su bcontractors vs suppliers of goods, works and services
The core criterium for distinguishing between subcontracts and contracts/purchases is
whether they concern action tasks as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of
the Grant Agreement).
Subcontracts Purchases
Subcontracts concern the implementation Purchases concern any other contracting
12EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025

services) that are necessary for the
beneficiaries to implement the work (can
range from big equipment to petty goods)
but do not constitute by themselves an
action task described in Annex 1.
The price for the subcontracts will be The price for these contracts will be
declared as ‘Subcontracting costs’ in the declared in one of the ‘Purchase costs’
financial statement. columns in the financial statement.
Example (subcontracts): Subcontract to organise a conference that is set as part of the
tasks in Annex 1.
Example (purchases): Contract for an audit certificate on the financial statements; contract
for the translation of documents; contract for the publication of brochures; contract for the
creation of a website that enables the beneficiaries to work together (if creating the website is
just a project management tool and not a separate subcontracted ‘action task’); contract for
organisation of the rooms and catering for a meeting (if the organisation of the meeting is not
a separate subcontracted ‘action task’); contract for hiring IPR consultants/agents needed for
the project.
The same kind of items (e.g. writing materials) can qualify as purchases in one action
(simple consumables for the implementation of the action), but as subcontracting in another
(e.g. if it is an action task to acquire writing materials for a school).
Subcontractors and purchases vs affiliated entities
In contrast to subcontractors, affiliated entities have a link (e.g. legal or capital) with a
beneficiary which goes beyond the implementation of the action.
Subcontracts and purchases Affiliated entities

The eligible cost is the price charged to the The eligible costs are only the costs of the
beneficiary (usually containing a profit affiliated entity, no profit is allowed (neither

The beneficiary must award the contracts
and subcontracts on the basis of best value
for money (or lowest price) and absence of
conflict of interests.
Example (implementation by affiliated entity): Company X and company Y do not control
each other, but they are both fully owned by company Z. Company X is beneficiary in the grant
and company Y implements some of the action tasks described in Annex 1(testing and analysis
of the resistance of a new component under high temperatures).
Contributions against payment vs in-kind contributions (for free)
13EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In some projects, third parties make available some of their resources to a beneficiary
without this being part of their normal economic activity (i.e. seconding personnel,
contributing equipment, infrastructure or other assets, or other goods and services).
This can be done against payment or for free. If against payment, the costs paid can be
charged by the beneficiaries to the action (e.g. A.3 Seconded persons, C.2 Equipment and
C.3 Other goods, works and services); if for free, there are no costs that arise for the
beneficiaries, so nothing can be charged to the action (exception for HE: in-kind contributions
for free can under certain conditions be declared as eligible costs, see Article 6.1).
Example (in-kind contributions (for free)): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university. His salary is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but by the government (the
ministry). According to the secondment agreement, the government does not ask any
reimbursement in exchange (non-cash donation). Since the beneficiary does not incur any
costs, nothing can be charged to the grant. (exception for HE: the beneficiary can declare the
salary costs in its financial statements, even if they are paid by the ministry/government).
Example (contributions against payment): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university. His salary is paid by the government (the ministry) which employs him. According
to the secondment agreement, the beneficiary (the university) has to reimburse the
government an amount corresponding to the paid salary. The reimbursed amount is a cost for
the beneficiary and is recorded as such in its accounts. The beneficiary will declare the amount
reimbursed to the government in its financial statements.
Associated partners vs affiliated entities and third parties giving in-kind contributions
A new type of participant has been introduced (new for 2021-2027), the so-called associated
partners. They may implement action tasks, but in contrast to affiliated entities they do not
need to have a capital or legal link to a beneficiary and cost incurred by associated partners
can NOT be declared as eligible cost. In contrast to third parties giving in-kind contributions,
the associated partners are fully named in the Grant Agreement and may implement
important action tasks by themselves.
Entities that do not request funding or are not eligible for funding may participate in EU
actions as associated partners, for example out of interest in contributing to the objectives of
the action, gaining visibility, or participating due to ongoing (R&D) cooperation with a
beneficiary.
As with any other participant that does not sign the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries need
to ensure (e.g. through the consortium agreement) that associated partners implement their
action tasks in accordance with the Grant Agreement.
Where possible, associated partners should be linked to a specific beneficiary.
Combination of roles
In principle, each person or entity should only participate in a single role in an action. This is
to avoid any potential conflicts of interest and ensure clear allocation of rights and obligations
as well as certainty on cost eligibility.
A combination of roles within the same action is only possible in the following very limited
cases provided it is not used in a way to circumvent rules of the Grant Agreement:
- Associated partner + third party giving in-kind contribution: If necessary for
the implementation of the action, associated partners implementing their own tasks
may also support beneficiaries and affiliated entities in the implementation of their
tasks by providing in-kind contributions.
- Associated partner/third party giving in-kind contribution/ + subcontractor:
It is in principle possible for an associated partner or a third party giving in-kind
contributions in support of certain parts of the action to also compete for subcontracts
for other parts of the same action. If, in accordance with the criteria for awarding
14EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
subcontracts (best value for money or lowest price, no conflict of interest), an
associated partner or a third party already giving in-kind contributions gives the best
offer, it may also participate as a subcontractor.
- Recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) + any other role:
Recipients of financial support to third parties must normally be third parties to the
agreement. Beneficiaries are not allowed to provide financial support under the Grant
Agreement to themselves or their affiliated entities. However, certain exceptions may
be made if explicitly allowed in the call conditions/Grant Agreement and justified in
the DoA Annex 1 (e.g. for HE Co-funded Partnerships, see Annex 5 > HE Co-funded
Partnerships). By contrast, in the case of third parties providing in-kind contributions
or subcontractors, assuming that the financial support is not directly related to their
tasks, they are considered third parties to the agreement and may therefore in
principle receive financial support to third parties under the conditions set out in the
Grant Agreement.

1. Consortium: Coordinator — Beneficiaries — Affiliated entities — Other
participants
In EU grants, the consortium is normally composed of the key project participants, i.e.
typically the coordinator and the other beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated
partners. Sometimes also subcontractors and third parties that contribute to the action are
included.
The coordinator is the beneficiary which is the central contact point for the granting
authority and represents the consortium (towards the granting authority). For mono-
beneficiary grants, the mono-beneficiary also has the coordinator role.
The signature arrangements are the following:
− the coordinator directly signs the Grant Agreement
− the other beneficiaries sign the Grant Agreement by signing the Accession Form (see
Article 40). Only beneficiaries sign the Accession Form. Affiliated entities, associated
partners etc. do NOT sign the Accession Form.
Amendments to the GA, if any, will be signed by the coordinator on behalf of the other
beneficiaries.
The division of roles and responsibilities within the consortium are explained in Article 7.
Generally speaking:
− the coordinator must coordinate and manage the grant, including distribution of
payments received from the granting authority, and is the central contact point for the
granting authority
− the beneficiaries must collectively together contribute to a smooth and successful
implementation of the project (i.e. implement their part of the action properly, comply
with their own obligations under the Grant Agreement and support the coordinator in
his obligations).
The beneficiaries are bound by the grant terms and conditions. This means that they must:
18EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− carry out the action as described in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of the
Grant Agreement) and
− comply with all the other provisions of the Grant Agreement and all the applicable
provisions of EU, international and national law (including general principles, such as
fundamental rights, values, and ethical principles).
The involvement of other participants which do not sign the Grant Agreement (affiliated
entities, associated partners, subcontractors, etc) varies depending on the role. Since there is
no formal contractual link with them, their obligations will always be enforced through the
responsible beneficiaries.
The consortium set-up must follow the roles in the Grant Agreement.
Participants should be attributed their roles according to their real contribution to the project.
The main actors should be the beneficiaries or affiliated entities. All other roles should be
complementary.
This means for instance:
− affiliated entities — are allowed to fully participate in the action; they are treated like
beneficiaries for most issues (including cost eligibility); they do not however have
access to the Portal My Area section (see Article 36); annotations in this AGA which
refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to affiliated entities (just like the provisions of
the MGA themselves; see also MGA Preamble)
− subcontracting — beneficiaries/affiliated entities may NOT subcontract tasks to other
beneficiaries/affiliated entities
− coordinator tasks — the coordinator tasks listed in the Grant Agreement may NOT be
subcontracted (they can only be delegated, under certain circumstances, to an entity
with ‘authorisation to administer’ or in the case of ‘sole beneficiaries’ within the
meaning of Article 190(2) of the Financial Regulation 2024/25094; see Article 7).
For an overview on the different types of third parties and their roles, rights and obligations
under the Grant Agreement, see the table in Article 7.
If you are an assocation with members who will implement some of the action activities (or an
European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) or joint venture), you should make sure that the
members participate as affiliated entities, so that they will be able to charge their costs to the
project. Otherwise these costs will NOT be eligible.
2. Name and address — Legal entity data
The legal entity data (legal name, address, legal representatives, etc) of the beneficiaries
comes from the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register (former ‘Beneficiary Register’).
This data will be automatically used for all communications concerning the grant (see Article
36) and will also be used in case you are applying for other EU grants, prizes or tenders (if
managed through the Portal).
The beneficiaries (via their legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)) must keep their data in
the Participant Register up-to-date at all times including after the end of the grant (see Article
19).

1 If the RAO decides to set specific rules, they must be set out in the call and take into account the value of the contracts and the relative size
of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk (proportionality). Specific rules may only be set for the award of
contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000.
2 This is a standard obligation for all EU grants. It may be unselected only for actions where subcontracting is a key/large part of the action
(e.g infrastructure projects; technical assistance, statistical programmes, etc).

1. Data Sheet
The Data Sheet shows ALL options in the Grant Agreement (i.e. all provisions in the terms
and conditions that are flagged as options — marked by red or green brackets).
The Data Sheet uses the IT labels that are used by the Portal Grant Management System for
the automatic generation of the contracts.
These labels do NOT necessarily reflect the precise legal provisions and must therefore ALWAYS
be cross-checked with the full text of the corresponding provision in the terms and conditions
Examples:
1. The options ‘Actual costs/Unit or actual cost’ for travel and subsistence in the Data Sheet are linked to the
corresponding Options in Article 6.2.C.1. Thus, ‘Unit or actual costs’ does NOT mean that the beneficiaries
can freely choose which cost form to use. The cost form to be used is prescribed by the conditions in Article
6.2.C.1.
2. The options ‘Yes/No’ for VAT in the Data Sheet are linked to the Options in Article 6.3(viii). Thus, ‘Yes’
means eligible under the conditions set out in that provision (Article 6.3(viii)); ‘No’ means always ineligible.
Red options are options which have been selected at programme- or type of action-level.
Green options are options that are selected either at call- or project-level.

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL
General > Article 1 — Subject
ARTICLE 1 — SUBJECT OF THE AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 1 — SUBJECT OF THE AGREEMENT
This Agreement sets out the rights and obligations and terms and conditions applicable to the grant awarded
[OPTION for SGAs: under Framework Partnership Agreement No [insert number] — [insert acronym]] for
the implementation of the action set out in Chapter 2.
1. Subject of the Grant Agreement
The Grant Agreement sets out the rights and obligations of each party and the terms and
conditions of the grant that beneficiaries must comply with when implementing the action
(i.e. the project).
Grants are public funding in form of donation (i.e. a free, non-reimbursable contribution). The
EU donates to actions because it is a way to incentivise activities that are in the public policy
interest. It is a positive way to support and involve citizens and encourage broad cooperation
across borders without taking ownership in the action.
The granting authority is NOT procuring your work, goods or services, nor is your project
‘done for the European Commission’ or any other EU granting authority.

CHAPTER 2 ACTION
General > Article 3 — Action
ARTICLE 3 — ACTION
ARTICLE 3 — ACTION
The grant is awarded for the action [insert project number] — [insert acronym] (‘action’), as described in
Annex 1.
[OPTION for programmes with linked actions: [OPTION if selected for the grant16: This action is linked to
the action(s) set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 1) (‘linked actions’).]]
16 Linked actions cover all types of joint/combined/coordinated actions, where the action implementation should be linked to another action
(e.g. Horizon complementary grants, Horizon joint actions; Horizon MSCA SNLS grants, EDIDP COFUND, JU implementing grants,
etc.).
1. Actions
The grant is awarded to allow the consortium to implement the action as described in the
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement (i.e. the project).
Depending on the EU programme under which the grant is awarded, your action may belong
to a specific type of action that is mentioned in the call conditions (e.g. Project Grants, Lump
Sum Grants, Infrastructure Grants, Grants for Procurement, Coordination and Support
Actions, etc).
2. Linked actions
Linked actions are used when the granting authority wishes to establish a formal link between
your action and other activities, that may for example complement, precede or succeed your
project.
The linked action is identified in the Grant Agreement (see Data Sheet, Point 1) and may
refer to any formally set-up activity, such as other EU grants, but also grants from EU
Member States or international organisations, blended finance, or activities carried out under
procurement contracts, etc.
The beneficiaries of both actions must have arrangements, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly. If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet,
Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written collaboration agreement (or, if the
consortia are identical, as part of their consortium agreement; see Article 7).
Specific cases (linked actions):
EU Synergy actions — When projects are part of EU ‘Synergy calls’ (i.e. jointly coordinated
calls that pursue common policy objectives and allow for the combination of funding), they
will always be flagged as ‘Synergy actions’ and benefit from the special cost eligibility rules in
Article 6.3. Other actions (not part of a ‘Synergy call’) can be flagged by the granting
authority as ‘Synergy action’ on request. This is typically needed if an action should benefit
from different combined EU grants. In this case, the beneficiaries must inform both granting
authorities so that they can take measures to prevent double funding. For details, see Article
6.3.

General > Article 4 — Duration and starting date
ARTICLE 4 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE
ARTICLE 4 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE
The duration and the starting date of the action are set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 1).
1. Action starting date
The action starting date is fixed in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement.
It is usually the first day of the month following the grant signature. But the parties can also
agree to a fixed starting date (if justified during grant preparation, e.g. conference that must
take place on a specific date).
The fixed starting date should normally be in the future (after grant signature) but it is
possible to propose an earlier starting date (retroactive).
Be however aware that by starting the action before signing the GA, you risk that the starting
date will not be accepted by the granting authority (which will assess the compliance with
applicable rules) or that the grant will not be signed, and no costs will be eligible (e.g. for
activities implemented before signature of the grant). Conversely, starting dates far in the
future affect normally also the timing of your (first) pre-financing payment.
The action starting date can normally NOT be before the submission of the proposal —
unless the Programme Regulation (basic act) allows this or in cases of emergency, e.g. for
humanitarian aid and civil protection, for urgencies in the veterinary or phytosanitary domain, etc.
The starting date will also affect the eligibility of costs (see Article 6.1(a)(ii)).
2. Action duration
The action duration is fixed in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement.
It usually comes from your proposal (based on the call conditions) and is expressed as a
number of months, running from the action starting date.
The action end date shown in the system is the date that is automatically calculated from the
starting date (starting date + months of duration).
The action duration relates only to the period during which the action tasks (set out in Annex 1)
are implemented. This is NOT the same as project closure (i.e. final payment) or the end of the
Grant Agreement. After the action end date, the beneficiaries still have to submit their final report
and the granting authority will have to make the payment of the balance. Moreover, certain
obligations under the Grant Agreement continue even afterwards (e.g. keeping supporting
documents in case of audits, continue to use certain equipment for the same objective, maintain
the website of the project if required, etc).

CHAPTER 3 GRANT
General > Article 5 — Grant
ARTICLE 5 — GRANT
ARTICLE 5 — GRANT
5.1 Form of grant
The grant is an action grant17 which takes the form of a [budget-based][activity-based] mixed actual cost
grant (i.e. a grant based on actual costs incurred, but which may also include other forms of funding, such as
unit costs or contributions, flat-rate costs or contributions, lump sum costs or contributions or financing not
linked to costs).
5.2 Maximum grant amount
The maximum grant amount is set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 3) and in the estimated budget (Annex 2).
[OPTION for programmes with contingency reserve: [OPTION if selected for the call: The maximum grant
amount can be raised at the end of the action, by activating the contingency reserve set out in the Data Sheet
(see Point 3).]]
5.3 Funding rate
[OPTION 1 for programmes with single funding rate (per action): The funding rate for costs is […]% of the
action’s eligible costs. Contributions are not subject to any funding rate.]
5.4 Estimated budget, budget categories and forms of funding
The estimated budget for the action is set out in Annex 2.
It contains the estimated eligible costs and contributions for the action, broken down by participant [OPTION
for programmes with activity-based budget:, type of activity] and budget category.
Annex 2 also shows the types of costs and contributions (forms of funding)19 to be used for each budget
category.
If unit costs or contributions are used, the details on the calculation will be explained in Annex 2a.
5.5 Budget flexibility
The budget breakdown may be adjusted — without an amendment (see Article 39) — by transfers (between
participants and budget categories), as long as this does not imply any substantive or important change to the
description of the action in Annex 1.
However:
- changes to the budget category for volunteers (if used) always require an amendment
- changes to budget categories with lump sums costs or contributions (if used; including financing not
linked to costs) always require an amendment
- changes to budget categories with higher funding rates or budget ceilings (if used) always require an
amendment
- addition of amounts for subcontracts not provided for in Annex 1 either require an amendment or
simplified approval in accordance with Article 6.2
- other changes require an amendment or simplified approval, if specifically provided for in Article
6.2
- [OPTION 1 by default: flexibility caps: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes with flexibility
caps: [OPTION 1 by default: flexibility caps: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the call:
flexibility caps: [transfers between budget categories of more than [20%][[…%]] [of the total costs
and contributions][per budget category] set out in Annex 2 require an amendment][[other]]]] .
17 For the definition, see Article 183(2)(a) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: ‘action grant’ means an EU grant to finance “an action
intended to help achieve a Union policy objective”.
19 See Article 125 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
34EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Form of grant
EU grants are normally ‘budget-based mixed actual cost’ grants (meaning grants, broken
down by budget categories and participants, and based on actual costs incurred and other
simplified forms of funding (e.g. normally unit costs for SME owners/natural person
beneficiaries and volunteers, if applicable and flat rate costs for indirect costs).
However, depending on the programme and on the type of action, grants may also be:
− pure actual cost grants (e.g. some operating grants)
− pure lump sum grants
− pure unit grants
− ‘activity-based mixed actual cost’ grants, i.e. broken down by budget categories as
well as by activities
or
− any other combination of costs and/or contributions.
For guidance on other types of grants, see How to manage your lump sum grants.
Ge neral > Article 5.2 Maximum grant amount
2. Maximum grant amount
The maximum grant amount set out in this Article defines the maximum amount of funding
that the granting authority has available for the grant. It is a ceiling and not necessarily the
‘final grant amount’ and in any case not a ‘price’ due to the beneficiaries. It can NOT be
exceeded, e.g. to accommodate higher or anticipated cost.
The maximum grant amount can NOT be increased — even if the eligible costs of the action
are higher than planned.
Specific cases (maximum grant amount):
Contingency reserve (RELEX) — In some programmes, the maximum grant amount
foreseen in the award decision may go beyond the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 to
accommodate a ‘contingency reserve’. In this case, the maximum grant amount in Annex 2
can be raised during the action by activating the contingency reserve (— up to the maximum
grant amount set out in the award decision). This requires the agreement of the granting
authority and must be requested through an amendment (see Article 39).
General > Article 5.3 Funding rate
3. Funding rate
EU grants are normally subject to ‘co-financing’ or ‘co-funding’, meaning that the EU granting
authority does only provide a part of the funding of the action and the remaining parts must
be financed from the beneficiaries’ own resources, income generated by the action (e.g. by
selling results), or financial or in-kind contributions from third parties (e.g. grants from
national or private funding programmes). As such, the EU grants are normally subject to a
single funding rate for the entire action — which is expressed as a fixed percentage and
announced in the call conditions. Through the application of the funding rate (a percentage of
the eligible cost), co-financing is ensured as the remaining no eligible cost will need to be
35EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
covered from other sources. Normally the granting authority does not require any further
information on the sources of co-financing, unless specifically requested for the action.
For some programmes and types of action (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, I3, ERDF-TA, SMP,
RELEX), there are however several funding rates inside the project. These may depend on:
− the type of beneficiaries (e.g. SMEs; for-profit or non-profit legal entities, place of
establishment etc)
− the type of cost categories to be covered (e.g. FSTP)
− the type of activities to be performed (for activity-based grants).
Where funding rates are based on the type of beneficiary, beneficiaries and their affiliated
entities will be assessed separately. The funding rate of a beneficiary does NOT condition the
funding rate of its affiliated entities.
Example: The beneficiary is entitled to a 70 % funding rate, it has an affiliated entity entitled to a
funding rate of 100 %. The cost incurred by the affiliated entities will be funded at 100 % —
despite the lower funding rate of the beneficiary to which it is linked.
In order to avoid abuse, the budget flexibility is restricted. Changes that would entail a higher
funding rate (e.g. change between budget category or activity, relocation of budget (and
tasks) to a beneficiary with higher rate) are always subject to an amendment. Changes
between beneficiaries with different funding rates will be monitored closely, to ensure that
no disproportionate amount of tasks and budget is transferred from the beneficiary to its
affiliated entity or vice versa in order to unduly profit from funding rate differences (budget
transfers that result in substantive or important changes, i.e. changes that would also affect
the description of the action in Annex 1, are subject to a mandatory amendment).
Conditions for the funding rate must normally be complied with throughout the action.
Thus, a change of activity, type of beneficiary, etc. affecting the conditions for the funding rate,
would also require a change of the funding rate (including specific increases or bonuses based on
pre-set conditions) in line with the original call conditions.
General > Article 5.4 Estimated budget, budget categories and forms of funding
4. Estimated budget
The estimated budget of the action is calculated on the basis of the estimated eligible costs
and — if applicable —contributions submitted by the consortium, and is annexed to the Grant
Agreement (Annex 2).
The estimated budget also determines the maximum grant amount for each
beneficiary/affiliated entity and for the action as a whole (see above).
5. Budget categories and forms of funding
The budget categories are listed in Article 6.2 and reflected, for each programme and type
of action, in the budget table in Annex 2.
The standard budget categories which usually apply are the following:
− Personnel costs
− Costs for employees (or equivalent)
− Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract
− Costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment
− Costs for SME owners/beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary (not
all programmes)
36EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− Costs for volunteers’ work (not all programmes)
− Costs for other personnel categories (only SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
− Subcontracting costs
− Purchase costs
− Travel costs, accommodation costs and subsistence costs (all programmes
except RFCS, CCEI)
− Equipment costs
− Costs of other goods, works and services
− Other cost categories
− Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (all programmes except RFCS, EUAF,
CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM)
− Internally invoiced goods and services (only HE, DEP and EDF)
− Indirect costs
Depending on the EU programme and on the the type of action, additional programme-
specific budget categories may apply, for instance:
− HE Access to research infrastructure costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_RI)
− HE PCP/PPI procurement costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_PCP/PPI)
− HE ERC additional funding (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_ERC_Additional funding)
− CEF Studies (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Studies)
− CEF Synergetic elements (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Synergetic elements)
− CEF Works in outermost regions (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Works in outermost regions)
− CEF Land purchase ( see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Land purchase)
− LIFE Land purchase (see Article 6.2.D.X LIFE_Land purchase)
− AMIF EMN ad hoc queries (see Article 6.2.D.X AMIF_EMN ad hoc queries)
These budget categories may be cost-based (actual costs, unit costs, flat-rate costs, lump
sum costs, costs according to usual cost accounting practices) or contribution-based, i.e.
fixed by the granting authority on the basis of a cost-related methodology including e.g.
indirect cost (unit contribution, lump sum contribution, flat-rate contribution) or a non-cost
related methodology (financing not linked to cost). Which of these forms of funding applies,
is shown, for each budget category, in the estimated budget (Annex 2).
If unit costs or contributions are used, the details on the calculation will be explained in
Annex 2a of the Grant Agreement.
General > Article 5.5 Budget flexibility
6. Budget transfers (budget flexibility)
The budget in Annex 2 is an estimation. The budget is therefore in principle flexible (with
certain exceptions, see below).
37EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
A transfer can NOT lead to an increase of the maximum grant amount.
Moreover, you should be aware that the budget table is considered by the granting authority
to reflect the actual situation and may therefore be the basis for certain decisions, such as the
calculation of amounts to be offset from (pre-financing) payments for beneficiaries that have
outstanding debts to the Commission (see Article 22).
As a general principle, beneficiaries may transfer budget among themselves, between
affiliated entities or between budget categories (without requesting an amendment; see
Article 39) and — at the time of reporting — declare costs that are different from the
estimated budget provided that the action remains in line with the description of the action in
Annex 1 (if this is not the case, an amendment is needed, under the conditions of Article 39).
If the incurred eligible costs during the action implementation turn out to be lower than the
estimated eligible costs, the difference can thus be allocated to another beneficiary or
another budget category. The amount reimbursed for the other beneficiary/other budget
category (to which the budget transfer is intended) may thus be higher than planned.
Example: The estimated budget includes personnel costs of EUR 60 000 for beneficiary A and EUR
75 000 for beneficiary B. However, at the end of the action, the actual personnel costs of beneficiary
A are EUR 75 000 due to an increase in salaries or to the need to employ additional personnel to
carry out the tasks mentioned in Annex 1 while the actual personnel costs of beneficiary B are EUR
60 000. This may be acceptable provided the additional costs of beneficiary A fulfil the eligibility
requirements of Article 6 and up to the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 (at the level of the
action).
The following changes always require an amendment:
− changes to the description of the action in Annex 1
− changes to the budget category for volunteers (if used)
− changes to budget categories with lump sums costs or contributions (if used; including
financing not linked to costs)
− changes to budget categories or activities with higher funding rates or budget ceilings
(if used)
− activation of the contingency reserve (where foreseen in the Grant Agreement).
The following require either an amendment or a simplified approval procedure:
− addition of amounts for subcontracts not provided for in Annex 1
− other changes in certain specific cost categories, if specifically provided for in Article
6.2.
Best practice: In case of doubt, the coordinator should consult the granting authority on
whether a change requires an amendment or — at least — a simplified approval procedure.
Specific cases (grant)
Simplified approval procedure (general)— For some cases and types of cost indicated,
the Grant Agreement provides for simplified approval procedures, meaning that beneficiaries
can ask for an ex post approval by the granting authority to accept costs which have been
incurred, but were not planned in the estimated budget. For such simplified approval, they
must declare the costs in question in the next periodic report and flag and justify them.
Simplified approval is however at the full discretion of the granting authority. This means that
the beneficiaries bear the risk that the costs might not be approved at interim or final
payment-stage later on.
Flexibility caps — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, transfers between
budget categories going beyond a certain threshold percentage require an amendment. In
38EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
this case, unauthorised changes going beyond the threshold may be rejected (cost rejection,
applied to beneficiaries concerned/equally among the consortium members).
Financial support to third parties (FSTP) — A transfer from the budget category of
financial support to third parties to any other category usually implies a significant change to
the nature of the action and often requires also changes to the description of the action.
Therefore, such a transfer normally requires an amendment of the Grant Agreement.

6.1 General eligibility conditions
ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
In order to be eligible, costs and contributions must meet the eligibility conditions set out in this Article.
6.1 General eligibility conditions
The general eligibility conditions are the following:
(a) for actual costs:
(i) they must be actually incurred by the beneficiary
(ii) they must be incurred in the period set out in Article 4 (with the exception of costs relating
to the submission of the final periodic report, which may be incurred afterwards; see
Article 21)
(iii) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(iv) they must be incurred in connection with the action as described in Annex 1 and necessary
for its implementation
(v) they must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts
in accordance with the accounting standards applicable in the country where the
beneficiary is established and with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices
(vi) they must comply with the applicable national law on taxes, labour and social security and
(vii) they must be reasonable, justified and must comply with the principle of sound financial
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency
(b) for unit costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the units must:
- be actually used or produced by the beneficiary in the period set out in Article 4
(with the exception of units relating to the submission of the final periodic report,
which may be used or produced afterwards; see Article 21)
- be necessary for the implementation of the action and
(iii) the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records
and documentation (see Article 20)
(c) for flat-rate costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the costs or contributions to which the flat-rate is applied must:
- be eligible
- relate to the period set out in Article 4 (with the exception of costs or contributions
relating to the submission of the final periodic report, which may be incurred
afterwards; see Article 21)
40EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(d) for lump sum costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the work must be properly implemented by the beneficiary in accordance with Annex 1
(iii) the deliverables/outputs must be achieved in the period set out in Article 4 (with the
exception of deliverables/outputs relating to the submission of the final periodic report,
which may be achieved afterwards; see Article 21)
(e) for unit, flat-rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to usual cost accounting practices (if
any):
(i) they must fulfil the general eligibility conditions for the type of cost concerned
(ii) the cost accounting practices must be applied in a consistent manner, based on objective
criteria, regardless of the source of funding
(f) for financing not linked to costs (if any), the results must be achieved or the conditions must be
fulfilled as described in Annex 1.
In addition, for direct cost categories (e.g. personnel, travel & subsistence, subcontracting and other direct
costs) only costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed to it
directly are eligible. They must not include any indirect costs (i.e. costs that are only indirectly linked to the
action, e.g. via cost drivers).
[OPTION for programmes with in-kind contributions eligible: In-kind contributions provided by third
parties free-of charge may be declared as eligible direct costs by the beneficiaries which use them (under the
same conditions as if they were their own, provided that they concern only direct costs and that the third
parties and their in-kind contributions are set out in Annex 1 (or approved ex post in the periodic report, if
their use does not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; ‘simplified approval procedure’).]
1. Eligible costs
The grant can only reimburse eligible costs (and, where applicable, contributions; see Article
6.2.F), i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific conditions set out in this Article.
Therefore, beneficiaries/affiliated entities must enter ONLY eligible costs into the estimated
budget (see Article 5.4), and later on into the financial statements (see Article 21). If
ineligible costs are declared, they will be rejected (see Article 27).
Article 6.1 lists the general eligibility conditions for each form of funding (actual costs, unit,
flat-rate, lump sum, costs according to usual cost accounting practices, financing not linked
to costs); Article 6.2 refers to the specific eligibility conditions for each budget category.
Cost eligibility is NOT the same as beneficiary/action eligibility. The latter are normally
checked upstream (before grant signature/amendment), in order to make sure that only eligible
beneficiaries/actions are selected for a grant. Loss of beneficiary/action eligibility during an ongoing
grant normally leads to termination or change of status (see Articles 32 and 39); costs become
automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility.
For a consolidated list of eligibility issues relating to specific situations/legal framework in
individual countries, see AGA — List of country-specific issues.
41EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. General eligibility conditions for actual costs
In order to be eligible, actual costs must be:
− actually incurred by the beneficiary/affiliated entity, i.e.:
− real and not estimated, budgeted or imputed and
− definitively and genuinely borne by the beneficiary/affiliated entity (not by any
other entity)
− incurred during the action duration, i.e. the generating event that triggers the costs
must take place during the action duration set out in the Data Sheet.
If costs are invoiced or paid later than the end date, they are eligible only if the debt
existed already during the action duration (supported by documentary evidence) and
the final cost are known at the moment of the final report.
Example: Costs of services or equipment supplied to a beneficiary may be invoiced and paid
after the end date of the action, e.g. because of warranty periods, if the services or equipment
were used by the beneficiary during the action duration. By contrast, costs of services or
equipment supplied after the end of the action (or after GA termination) are normally not
eligible.
− entered as eligible costs in the estimated budget, under the relevant budget
category in Annex 2
This requirement is in practice automatically ensured by the IT system, since the
financial statements mirror the budget categories that are available for the estimated
budget. The only thing you need to pay attention to, is whether all the special cost
categories (visible in the estimated budget and financial statements for the
programme) are really eligible under the specific call you applied for (e.g. financial
support to third parties (FSTP), etc; see call conditions). If not, you should leave those
columns empty and NOT enter any costs (they are ineligible and will be rejected).
The requirement also has no impact on budget flexibility; costs may be transferred
between beneficiaries and eligible budget categories without amending the Grant
Agreement, under the conditions set out in Article 5.5.
− connected to the action and necessary for its implementation as described in
Annex 1, i.e. to achieve the action’s objectives
The grant cannot be used to finance activities other than those approved by the
granting authority.
Examples:
1. The activities of the project cost less than foreseen so the beneficiary decides to conduct
additional activities including for example hiring additional staff, organising an additional event,
renewing office equipment. Additional activities regularly require a change of the description of
the action (Annex 1). To be eligible, such reallocation of ‘savings’ need to be pre-discussed with
the granting authority and may regularly require an amendment.
2. Activities that violate the Grant Agreement (e.g. activities that are against the call conditions,
against applicable law, against EU values, etc.) can never be necessary for the implementation
of the action and therefore any cost related to such activities do not fulfil the general eligibility
conditions.
− identifiable and verifiable, i.e. come directly from the beneficiary/affiliated entity’s
accounts, be directly reconcilable with them and supported by documentation
The records and supporting documents must show the actual costs of the work, i.e.
what was actually paid or recorded in the beneficiary’s profit and loss accounts (see
Article 20).
42EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs must be calculated according to the applicable accounting rules of the country in
which the beneficiary is established and according to the beneficiary’s usual cost
accounting practices.
Example: If a beneficiary always charges a particular cost as an indirect cost, it must do so
also for EU and Euratom grants, and should not charge it as a direct cost.
Be aware however, that the usual cost accounting practices may NOT be used as an
excuse for non-compliance with other Grant Agreement provisions. You must bring
your usual cost accounting practices in line with the Grant Agreement (e.g. conditions
for calculating personnel costs; conditions for charging depreciation costs, etc.).
− in compliance with applicable national laws on taxes, labour and social security
and
− reasonable, justified and must comply with the principles of sound financial
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency (i.e. be in line with
good housekeeping practice when spending public money and not be excessive).
‘Economy’ means minimising the costs of resources used for an activity (input), while
maximising quality; ‘efficiency’ is the relationship between outputs and the resources
used to produce them.
Examples:
1. The beneficiary may NOT increase the remuneration of its personnel, upgrade its travel policy
or its purchasing rules because of the grant support.
2. Entertainment or hospitality expenses (including gifts, special meals and dinners) are
generally not eligible.
3. Tips which are not obligatory are not eligible. By contrast, in some countries the invoice
includes a certain mandatory amount as payment for the ‘service’. In this case, the amount
may be considered eligible — if the other eligibility conditions are fulfilled.
Double funding risk — A cost item or element can NOT be declared more than once within
the same or another budget category or activity (e.g. cost for internally invoiced goods and
services cannot include cost elements already charged under equipment cost).
Specific cases (actual costs):
Costs related to preparing, submitting and negotiating the proposals — Can generally
NOT be declared as eligible for the action (they are incurred before the action starts), this
includes cost for the preparation of the consortium agreement which should be signed before
the action starts. However, costs related to updating the consortium agreement may be
eligible if incurred during the action duration and in line with the general and specific
eligibility conditions, in particular being necessary for the implementation of the action.
Travel costs for the kick-off/closing meeting — Even if the first leg of the journey takes
place before the action starting date (e.g. the day before the kick-off meeting), the costs may
be eligible, if the meeting is held during the action duration. The same applies for the last leg
of a journey after the end of the action duration for a closing meeting.
Costs for reporting at the end of the action — Costs related to drafting and submitting
the final report are eligible even if they are incurred after the action duration.
Those costs include the cost of certificates on the financial statements (CFS) required by the
Grant Agreement and the cost of participating in a project review carried out by the granting
authority before the submission of the final report. They may also include the cost of
personnel necessary for the project review or to prepare the final report. However, they can
NOT include any other action activities foreseen in the Annex 1 and undertaken after the end
date of the action. For the daily rate to use for such personnel costs, see Article 6.2.A.1.
43EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs to allow for the participation of disabled people (e.g. costs for sign language
interpreters required for dissemination events organised under the action) — Are eligible if
they fulfil the general and specific eligibility conditions listed under Articles 6.1 and 6.2. The
beneficiaries must keep records (see Article 20) to prove in case of an audit, check or review
the actual costs incurred and that they were necessary for the implementation of the action.
Examples:
1. When subcontracting the organisation of an event that is necessary for the implementation of the
action, a beneficiary may select an offer that ensures full accessibility for persons with disability
under the consideration of best value for money instead of the lowest price.
2. When purchasing goods that are necessary for the implementation of the action, a beneficiary
may purchase goods that ensure accessibility for disabled persons even if this entails a higher
expense than comparable goods that do not offer accessibility.
Cost for security measures — Where the implementation of an action requires additional
security measures, costs can be declared under the appropriate cost category (e.g. personnel
costs for security staff, equipment costs for secure rooms, etc) if in line with the general and
specific eligibility conditions, in particular these cost must be directly connected to the action
and necessary for its implementation. Conversely, costs for security not directly connected to
the action (i.e. normal security measures of the beneficiaries with or without the EU action)
are considered to be fully covered by the indirect costs.
3. General eligibility conditions for unit costs
In order to be eligible, unit costs or contributions must be:
− calculated by multiplying the number of actual units used to carry out the work (e.g.
number of hours worked on the action, number of tests performed, etc.) or produced
by the amount per unit
− the number of units must be necessary for the action
− the units must be used or produced during the action duration
and
− the beneficiaries must be able to show the link between the number of units declared
and the work on the action.
The records and supporting documents must show that the number of units declared was
actually used for the action (see Article 20). The actual costs of the work are not relevant.
Example: A beneficiary which is an SME declares for its owner who does not receive a salary 50
days worked for an action in 2022. If there is an audit, the SME beneficiary must be able to show
a record of the number of days worked by the owner for the action.
Specific cases (unit costs):
Costs declared on the basis of the usual cost accounting practices — If this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA: Average personnel
costs; HE, DEP, EDF: Internally invoiced goods and services), the beneficiaries must use unit
costs using their own usual cost accounting practices. In this case: neither the amount per
unit, nor the calculation method will be set out in Annex 2a of the Grant Agreement.
4. General eligibility conditions for flat-rate costs
In order to be eligible, flat-rate costs or contributions must be:
− calculated by applying a flat rate to certain costs (whether actual, unit or lump sum
costs).
Example (7 % flat rate for indirect costs — most programmes):
44EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
A beneficiary is working on an action and uses a daily rate of EUR 240 for personnel costs. The
beneficiary declares as eligible 40 day-equivalents of personnel costs + EUR 1 400 for other
goods, works and services + EUR 1 500 for subcontracting during the first reporting period.
Eligible direct costs: (40 x 240 = 9 600) + 1 400 + 1 500 = 12 500
Eligible indirect cost: 7 % flat-rate of 12 500= EUR 875
Total eligible costs: 12 500 + 875 = EUR 13 375.
Funding rate of 70 % = EUR 9 362,50.
Example (25 % flat rate for indirect costs — HE, EDF):
A beneficiary is working on an innovation action and uses a daily rate of EUR 240 for personnel
costs. The beneficiary declares as eligible 40 day-equivalents of personnel costs + EUR 1 400
for other goods and services + EUR 1 500 for subcontracting during the first reporting period.
Eligible direct costs: (40 x 240 = 9 600) + 1 400 + 1 500 = 12 500
Eligible indirect cost: 25 % flat-rate of 9 600 + 1 400 (not the 1 500 for subcontracting as the
flat-rate does not apply on this specific cost category) = EUR 2 750
Total eligible costs: 12 500 + 2 750 = EUR 15 250
Funding rate of 70 % = EUR 10 675.
The records and supporting documents must show that the costs to which the flat-rate is
applied are eligible (see Article 20). If a flat-rate is applied, the actual indirect costs are not
relevant for the granting authority and it is not necessary to calculate them precisely nor to
keep any supporting document related to these.
5. General eligibility conditions for lump sum costs
In order to be eligible:
− the lump sum costs or contributions must correspond to the amount of lump sum
costs set out in Annex 2
− the work must have been carried out in accordance to Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement
− the output or result triggering payment of the lump sum must have been achieved
during the action duration.
The records and supporting documents must show that the action tasks have been carried
out as described in Annex 1. The actual costs of the work are not relevant.
6. Financing not linked to costs
In order to be eligible:
− the results must be achieved or the conditions must be fulfilled as described in
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement during the action duration.
7. Direct and indirect costs
‘Direct costs’ are specific costs directly linked to the performance of the action and which can
therefore be directly booked to it.
They are:
− either costs that have been caused in full by the activities of the action
− or costs that have been caused in full by the activities of several actions (projects),
the attribution of which to a single action can, and has been, directly measured (i.e.
not attributed indirectly via an allocation key, a cost driver or a proxy).
The beneficiaries must be able to show (with records and supporting evidence) the link to the
action.
45EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Indirect costs’ are costs that cannot be identified as specific costs directly linked to the
performance of the action.
In practice, they are costs whose link to the action can NOT be (or has not been) measured
directly, but only by means of cost drivers or a proxy (i.e. parameters that apportion the total
indirect costs (overheads) among the different activities of the beneficiary).
Which kinds of cost fall under direct or indirect cost depends on the nature of the action
and may therefore vary between programmes and calls.
Where they are reimbursed as flat-rate (e.g. budget category E. Indirect costs in the EU
action grants), you do NOT need to calctulate the indirect costs incurred for the action. They are
covered by the flat-rate and automatically calculated by the IT system.
8. Conditions for eligible in-kind contributions for free (HE)
If eligible under the Grant Agreement (only for HE), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge costs for in-kind contributions made available for free.
What? These cover the costs, which a third party has for resources it contributes to the
action for free (i.e. made available for free for use by the project).
They must be declared under the budget category the beneficiary would use if they were
their own costs (e.g. ‘Personnel costs for seconded persons’, ‘Equipment costs’, ‘Costs for
other goods, works and services’, etc), as actual or unit cost, depending on the rules of the
budget category.
Example: Depreciation costs of equipment contributed free of charge must be declared under
cost category C.2 Equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2).
In addition to the general and specific eligibility conditions of the budget category used
(see Article 6.1 and 6.2), they must be limited to the direct costs incurred by the third party.
Example: A person not receiving a salary and who is the (co)owner of a SME is being seconded
by this SME (third party) to a beneficiary. The direct costs incurred by the SME can be declared
via the SME owner unit cost (daily rate) (see Article 6.2.A.4).
Moreover, the in-kind contribution and the contributing third party must be mentioned in
Annex 1 (simplified approval procedure; see below).
Specific cases (in-kind contributions eligible):
Simplified approval procedure (new in-kind contributions) — If the need for an in-kind
contribution was not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment
in order to introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk
that the granting authority might not approve the new contribution and reject the costs at
interim or final payment-stage later on.
Internal invoicing of goods and services (HE) — For Horizon Europe, the granting
authority can also accept costs that are internally invoiced in the third party providing in-kind
contributions. In this case, they should be declared under cost category D.2 Internally
invoiced goods and services (see Article 6.2.D.2). In that context, the rules on internal
invoicing apply (e.g. indirect (actual) costs of the third party can be included, depending on
the usual cost accounting practices of the third party when calculating its unit cost for
internally invoiced goods and services).

6.2 Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category
For each budget category, the specific eligibility conditions are as follows:
1. Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category.
All programmes follow in principle the basic set of common budget categories from the
General MGA (A. Personnel, B. Subcontracting, C. Purchases and D. Other). However not all
programmes use all the cost categories and some programmes may have special/additional
budget categories.
The eligibility conditions for all currently used budget categories are described in the following
sections.

This budget category covers the following subcategories:
− Costs for employees (or equivalent) (see Article 6.2.A.1)
− Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract and for personnel seconded
by a third party against payment (see Article 6.2.A.2 and A.3)
− Costs for SME owners not receiving a salary and for beneficiaries that are natural
persons not receiving a salary (see Article 6.2.A.4)

48EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 6.2.A.1 Employees
A.1 Employees (all programmes except SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
A.1 Costs for employees (or equivalent) are eligible as personnel costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility
conditions and are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an employment contract (or
equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the action.
They must be limited to salaries [additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: (including net
payments during parental leave)], social security contributions, taxes and other costs linked to the
remuneration, if they arise from national law or the employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and
be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred, in accordance with the following method:
{daily rate for the person
multiplied by
number of day-equivalents worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The daily rate must be calculated as:
{annual personnel costs for the person
divided by
215}
The number of day-equivalents declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 20).
[additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: The actual time spent on parental leave by a
person assigned to the action may be deducted from the 215 days indicated in the above formula.]
The total number of day-equivalents declared in EU grants, for a person for a year, cannot be higher than
215[additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: minus time spent on parental leave (if any)].
[OPTION A for programmes with standard rules for supplementary payments: The personnel costs may also
include supplementary payments for personnel assigned to the action (including payments on the basis of
supplementary contracts regardless of their nature), if:
- it is part of the beneficiary’s usual remuneration practices and is paid in a consistent manner
whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required
- the criteria used to calculate the supplementary payments are objective and generally applied by the
beneficiary, regardless of the source of funding used.]
[OPTION B for programmes with project-based supplementary payments:
For personnel which receives supplementary payments for work in projects (project-based remuneration), the
personnel costs must be calculated at a rate which:
- corresponds to the actual remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for the time worked by the
person in the action over the reporting period
- does not exceed the remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for work in similar projects funded
by national schemes (‘national projects reference’)
- is defined based on objective criteria allowing to determine the amount to which the person is
entitled
and
- reflects the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay consistently bonuses or supplementary payments
for work in projects funded by national schemes.
The national projects reference is the remuneration defined in national law, collective labour agreement
or written internal rules of the beneficiary applicable to work in projects funded by national schemes.
49EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If there is no such national law, collective labour agreement or written internal rules or if the project-
based remuneration is not based on objective criteria, the national project reference will be the average
remuneration of the person in the last full calendar year covered by the reporting period, excluding
remuneration paid for work in EU actions.]
[additional OPTION for programmes with average personnel costs: If the beneficiary uses average personnel
costs (unit cost according to usual cost accounting practices), the personnel costs must fulfil the general
eligibility conditions for such unit costs and the daily rate must be calculated:
- using the actual personnel costs recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts and excluding any costs
which are ineligible or already included in other budget categories; the actual personnel costs may be
adjusted on the basis of budgeted or estimated elements, if they are relevant for calculating the
personnel costs, reasonable and correspond to objective and verifiable information
and
- according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner, based on
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.]
1. Employees or equivalent (A.1): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS,
CUST/FISC or where declared ineligible in the call conditions), the beneficiaries/affiliated
entities may charge ‘Costs for employees or equivalent’.
This budget category covers the costs for employees or equivalent that worked in the action,
i.e. persons working for the beneficiary on the basis of an employment contract or equivalent
appointing act.
‘Equivalent appointing act’ means the appointing acts of civil servants (who do not sign
employment contracts, but receive official nominations for their posts).
ONLY costs for personnel assigned to the action (i.e. working for the project according to
internal written instructions, organisation chart or other documented management decision) can
be eligible.
Record-keeping — The monthly declaration of days worked in the project correctly signed
(see Article 20) OR reliable time records will normally be sufficient proof of the assignment to the
action — unless there is other contradicting evidence (e.g. the employment contract indicates that
the person was hired to work on another project).
What not? Cost of persons who work for the beneficiary, but NOT with an employment
contract or equivalent appointing act (e.g. staff provided by a temporary work agency,
seconded staff, self-employed persons with a direct contract with the beneficiary).
1.2 Costs for employees (or equivalent) must be declared as:
− actual personnel costs (standard case)
or
50EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− unit costs in accordance with the usual cost accounting practices (‘average personnel
costs’; if option applies in Grant Agreement; option in HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM,
HUMA).
1.3 The costs for employees (or equivalent) must comply with the eligibility conditions set
out in Article 6.2.A.1, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, etc.; see Article 6.1(a) and (b)) and
− be paid in accordance with national law, the collective labour agreement and the
employment contract/equivalent appointing act.
Generally, you may include, for each person concerned, the following:
− fixed salary
− fixed complements, if they are unconditional entitlements for the person (e.g. family
allowance and contributions to medical insurance schemes set out in national law,
complementary pension plan contributions set out in the collective labour agreement
or other binding documents such as staff regulations)
− variable complements, e.g. bonuses, if:
− they are paid based on objective conditions set out, at least, in the internal
rules of the beneficiary
− they are paid in a consistent manner, e.g. not just for actions supported by EU
grants, and
− where applicable, subject to the specific eligibility conditions for supplementary
payments (see specific cases below)
− social security contributions (mandatory employer and employee contributions)
− taxes linked to the remuneration (e.g. income tax withholding)
− other costs and payments linked to the remuneration if they are justified and
registered as personnel costs in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual remuneration
practices (e.g. benefits in kind like company car made available for the private use,
lunch vouchers, accrual for unconditional severance payments mandatory under
national law or other binding documents such as collective labour agreements or other
binding documents such as staff regulations).
You may NOT include:
− any part of the remuneration which has not been an actual cost for you (for example,
salaries reimbursed by a social security scheme or a private insurance in case of long
sick leave or maternity leave)
− payments of dividends to employees (profit distribution in the form of dividends)
− variable complements based on commercial targets or fund raising targets (because
neither incurred in connection with the work of the action, nor necessary for its
implementation)
− arbitrary bonuses (i.e. bonuses which are not paid based on objective conditions set
out, at least, in the internal rules of the beneficiary or bonuses that are not paid in a
consistent manner)
− bonuses that depend on budget availability on the specific project (e.g. paid only if
there are remaining funds in the budget of a project).
51EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Objective conditions’ means conditions which allow to identify who (e.g. what category of
employees) will receive how much (e.g. 5 € extra per hour, 10 % extra salary in each month
of full dedication) in what cases (e.g. time worked as lead researcher in cooperative projects;
an impartial and transparent assessment procedure on performance).
1.4 Calculation of the personnel costs. In most cases you have to calculate your personnel
costs for the action as follows:
Day- Daily rate
equivalents
{actual personnel
costs during the
Personnel Up to a declarable months within the
costs maximum of: reporting period}
{((215 / 12) divided by
multiplied by the
To be calculated
number of months {maximum
per person for
within the reporting declarable day-
each reporting
period
period) multiplied equivalents}
by the working
time factor}
You must do these calculations normally once per reporting period (RP)5 for each person
who worked in the action.
Adaptations may be needed for specific cases, such as project-based remuneration or
average personnel costs, depending on the applicable options in the Grant Agreement
(see specific cases below). Check the Data Sheet of your Grant Agreement, if specific
options apply.
Regarding the calculation of day-equivalents worked in the action:
It is the sum of the day-equivalents actually worked for the action, rounded to the nearest
half-day, and recorded in the monthly declarations or in your time-recording system (if you
have a reliable time-recording system where you record, at least, all the actual time worked
in the action).
For details on the declarations and on how to convert your working time on the action into
day-equivalents, see explanations in Article 20.
5 Alternatively, the calculation may be done separately for each calendar year within the reporting period, if this is
consistently applied. In that case, the ‘number of months within the reporting period’ referred to in the formulas
is to be understood as the number of months of the respective calendar year that are within the reporting
period.
52EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — In case of work on multiple actions per year, the total
number of day-equivalents declared across EU grants for the person can NOT be higher than 215
per calendar year (or the corresponding pro-rata by multiplying 215 with the working time factor),
to avoid double-funding of personnel cost.
Example: In the reporting period form 01/07/2022 to 31/12/2023 the horizontal ceiling per year for a 50%
part-time employee hired on 01/08/2022 would be:
− 2022: (215/12 x 5 [months employed in the RP]) x 0,5 [part-time] = 45 [rounded]
− 2023: (215/12 x 12) x 0,5 = 107,5
Regarding the maximum declarable day-equivalents:
To calculate the daily rate, you first need to determine the maximum declarable day-
equivalents. Since you may not declare more than 100% of your personnel cost, the number
of declarable day-equivalents in each reporting period is capped. The maximum declarable
day-equivalents for each reporting period are calculated as follows:
{((215 / 12) multiplied by the number of months [during which the person is employed] within the
reporting period) multiplied by the working time factor [e.g. 1 for full-time, 0.5 for 50% part time
etc.]}
You will round up or down to the nearest half day-equivalent.
Examples:
The reporting period runs from 01/01/2022 to 30/06/2022 (6 months):
Full-time case: The person is a full-time permanent employee hired in 2020. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 6 [months])
x 1 [full-time] = 107,5
Part-time case: The person is a 50% part-time permanent employee hired in 2020. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 6) x 0.5
[for 50% part-time] = 54
New hire case: The person is a 50% part-time employee hired on 1/06/2022. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 1 [only June
2022]) x 0.5 = 9
The number of months used for the calculation either equates the length of the reporting
period, or the length of employment of the person during this reporting period, if the latter is
shorter (e.g. the person is newly hired or no longer employed at any point during the
reporting period).
Example: In the reporting period from 01/01/2022 to 31/03/2023 (i.e. 15 months) you hire a new
person starting in full-time on 16/01/2023, with 2,5 months left in the reporting period. The
number of months for the calculation of the maximum declarable day-equivalents is accordingly 2,5,
not 15. The maximum number of declarable day-equivalents is ((215/12) x 2,5) x 1 = 45 [rounded
to the nearest half day-equivalent].
For the purpose of all personnel cost calculations a month is considered to have 30 days.
Example: In the reporting period form 01/05/2022 to 31/03/2023, you calculate the number of
months to be used when an employee is hired from 05/05/2022 until 20/10/2022:
- May: 26 days as of the day of being hired, i.e. 26 / 30 = 0,87 months
- June-September: 4 months
- October: 20 days until end of employment, i.e. 20 / 30 = 0,67 months
That is for the person in the reporting period: (26 / 30) + 4 + (20 / 30) = 5,54 months.
If the working time factor changes for the person during the reporting period (e.g. a change
from part-time to full-time, change of contract), you calculate the maximum declarable day-
equivalents separately for the months before and after this change of condition and add them
up afterwards to calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period.
Example:
53EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In the reporting period from 01/01/2022 to 31/03/2023, you work full-time in 2022 and 50% part-
time in 2023. You calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents separately for 2022 and 2023
(because conditions have changed).
12 months of full-time work: ((215 / 12) x 12) x 1 = 215
3 months of part-time work: ((215 / 12) x 3) x 0.5 = 26,88
Total: The maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period are therefore 215 + 26,88
= 242 (rounded to the nearest half day-equivalent).
Regarding the calculation of the daily rate:
You have to calculate a daily rate per person for the reporting period. For this, (irrespective
of the situation, i.e. full-time, part-time, partial hire, etc), you have to use the following
formula:
{actual personnel costs during the months within the reporting period}
divided by
{maximum declarable day-equivalents}
The actual personnel costs for the person are those eligible cost recorded in accordance with
your usual cost accounting practice in your (statutory) accounts until the end of the reporting
period for which you are calculating the daily rate.
Example: For a reporting period running from 01/01/2022 until 31/03/2023, to calculate the daily
rate (which you will apply to days worked by the person in the action from 01/01/2022 until
31/03/2023) you will take into account the total personnel costs of the person recorded in your
statutory accounts for the 12 months in 2022 and the 3 months in 2023 (January, February and
March).
If in line with the conditions described above, the personnel costs can include any component
that is legally obligatory by national law, the employment contract, or a similar act. Apart
from taxes and social security contributions, this may also include for example the thirteenth
salary, Christmas pay, etc. These personnel costs may also include supplementary payments
for personnel assigned to the action (including payments on the basis of supplementary
contracts regardless of their nature) if that is your usual remuneration practice for the kind of
work or expertise required and based on objective criteria used regardless of the source of
funding (i.e. not just for the individual EU grant).
Example:
In the reporting period from 01/12/2021 to 31/05/2023 (18 months), the person works 50% part-
time from 01/12/2021 to 31/05/2022 (6 months) and full-time afterwards (12 months). You
calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents and the daily rate for the reporting period as
follows:
Maximum declarable day-equivalents: Due to a change from part-time to full-time work, you need
to calculate the declarable day-equivalents separately for the period from 01/12/2021 to
31/05/2022 and afterwards. The 6 months of part-time work calculation would be ((215 / 12) x 6) x
0.5 = 53.75 for the part-time which you would have to add up with the result of the calculation for
the 12 months full-time period, which is 215 (i.e. ((215 / 12) x 12) x 1), the maximum number of
declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period would be 53.75 + 215 = 269 (rounded to
nearest half day-equivalent).
Daily rate: After taking into account all eligible elements (salary plus social contribution and taxes
etc.) you recorded in your accounts a total eligible cost of EUR 15 000 personnel costs for working 6
months part-time and EUR 60 000 for 12 months full-time for a total cost of EUR 75 000. The daily
rate for the person is calculated by dividing the personnel costs for the 18 months of work within
the reporting period with the maximum declarable day-equivalents, i.e. EUR 75 000 divided by 269
= EUR 278.81 daily rate.
For personnel costs related to drafting and submitting the final reports incurred after the
action duration (for example related to participation in a project review or to the preparation
of a final report; see Article 6.1),, the daily rate to be used is the one for the last reporting
period. The extra days should simply be added to the days declared in the final reporting
period; there is NO need to calculate a separate daily rate for them. The threshold of
54EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
maximum declarable day-equivalents (see Article 6.2.A.1) will however NOT apply to the
additional days.
Specific cases (costs for employees or equivalent (A.1)):
Teleworking — Teleworking days are accepted if:
− the beneficiary has in place clear rules allowing for teleworking, and
− the teleworked days were in line with those rules (for example: they did not exceed
the maximum days of teleworking allowed by the beneficiary’s rules).
End-of-contract indemnities during the action — If the employment of a person working
on the action ends during the action, the beneficiary may declare cost for end-of-contract
indemnities, if in line with the general and specific eligibility conditions, and in particular that
it is their usual remuneration practices (e.g. required by national law, not just applied for EU
actions, etc) and that these cost have not been included already in the calculation of the daily
rate (e.g. as accrual for unconditional severance payments mandatory under national law).
The eligible part of the indemnity can be charged in the reporting period in which the
employee’s contract ends. Since the entitlement to such indemnities is most often generated
over a period of time longer than the reporting period (or the action), only the part of the
indemnity that corresponds to the time worked by the person on the action can be charged
(i.e. a pro-rata of the indemnity amount in proportion to the time spent on the action). This
pro-rata amount should be added separately on top of the personnel costs calculated on the
basis of the daily rate.
Example:
6 month into the second reporting period (both RPs of 12 month) of an action, a full-time
employee, having worked a total of 154 day-equivalents on the action, stops being employed and
is entitled to an end-of-contract indemnity of EUR 10 750. The employee has accumulated this
indemnity over 5 years (60 months) of employment. You have determined that 3000€ of this are
attributable to the time of employment during the action (taking into account e.g. changes in
salary, indemnity conditions, working time, etc).
To determine the portion of the indemnity chargeable to the grant, you first divide EUR 3000
indemnity (corresponding to the time of employment during the action) by the maximum
declarable day-equivalents of the person during the action, i.e. {EUR 3000 divided by (215
[maximum declarable day-equivalents RP1] + 107,5 [maximum declarable day-equivalents RP2])
} = EUR 9,30 per declarable day-equivalent.
Then you multiply the indemnity amount per day-equivalent with the day-equivalents actually
worked on the action, i.e. EUR 9,30 x 154 [day-equivalents worked on the action in RP1+RP2] =
EUR 1432,20.
Parental leave (option in HE, HUMA) — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement,
days on parental leave during the reporting period may be deducted for the calculation of the
maximum declarable days and the calculation of the daily rate (i.e. by reducing the maximum
declarable day-equivalents in the formulas by the number of day-equivalents spent on
parental leave). Parental leave is any leave directly related to the birth or adoption of a child.
Other leaves or absences can NOT be deducted, including long-term sick leave, breastfeeding
leave and leave to take care of a sick child. The personnel costs used for the calculation of
the daily rate during the reporting period in which the parental leave takes place, may only
contain costs actually incurred by the beneficiary (e.g. exclude any costs already covered by
a national scheme paying the person on parental leave or reimbursing the beneficiary).
Example:
In a reporting period from 01/12/2021 to 31/01/2023 (14 months), an employee working full-time
on the action takes four months of parental leave after the birth of a child, that is 71,67 day-
equivalents (i.e. {((215/12) x 4 [months on parental leave]) x 1 [working time factor as per
contract]}).
The maximum number of declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period is calculated as
follows: {((215/12) x 14 [months]) x 1} minus 71,67 day-equivalents of parental leave = 179,16,
rounded to 179 maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period.
55EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
You will use this number (179) to calculate the daily rate, i.e. (actual personnel costs during the
reporting period) divided by 179.
Multiple parallel or consecutive contracts — If a person is employed with more than one
employment contract with the beneficiary during the reporting period (where allowed by
applicable law), the beneficiary should calculate a single daily rate. The actual personnel
costs are the sum of the costs of all these employment contracts during the months within
the reporting period. The maximum declarable day-equivalents are the sum of the maximum
declarable day-equivalents calculated individually for each of these employment contracts
during the months within the reporting period.
Contracts without fixed salary/hours — The maximum number of declarable day-
equivalents for employees that do not have a fixed amount of salary and working hours
defined in their contract but only an hourly rate (where allowed by applicable law and not
fitting under other cost categories, e.g. SME owners, subcontracting) can be calculated as
follows:
{((total salary paid to the employee in the reporting period) divided by (hourly rate fixed in the
employment contract)) divided by 8 [default day conversion factor]}
Example: A person does not have a fixed amount of working time and salary set out in the
contract but the contract specifies that the persons earns EUR 10/hour when called to perform a
certain task. Under the contract, you paid the persons EUR 7000 during the reporting period. The
maximum declarable day-equivalents are = EUR 7000 / 10 [hourly rate] / 8 = 87,5 for the
reporting period.
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — Such staff can NOT be charged under this
budget category because contracts with temporary work agencies qualify typically as
purchase of services (unless the temporary work agency carries out directly some task of the
action — in which case it would be considered as subcontracting). Although not eligible as
personnel costs, the costs can be charged under other budget categories (i.e. B.
Subcontracting or C.3 Other goods, works and services), if they comply with the eligibility
conditions (e.g. best value for money and no conflict of interest; see Articles 6.2.B and
6.2.C).
Project-based remuneration (option in HE) — If this option is activated in the Grant
Agreement, the beneficiaries may use this specific calculation method for the daily rate.
Note that for Horizon Europe, there are all in all three different ways how to calculate
the daily rate:
Case 1A: employee whose remuneration is fixed, i.e. same remuneration, regardless
whether they are involved in specific projects or not (actual costs; standard case, see 2.1.4
above)
Case 1B: employees whose remuneration increases through supplementary payments
depending on whether they work in specific projects (actual costs; specific case ‘project-
based remuneration’, this section)
Case 2: beneficiaries declaring personnel costs as unit costs in accordance with their usual
cost accounting practices (unit costs; specific case ‘average personnel costs’, see next
specific case below).
Project-based remuneration (Case 1B) should be used for employees (or equivalent) whose
level of remuneration (daily rate, hourly rate) increases when and because the employee
works in (EU, national or other) projects.
Example: An employee who gets a bonus or a new contract with a higher salary level for working
in a project.
56EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Employees whose salary does not increase when working in projects are covered by
Case 1A (not Case 1B); even when:
− the employment contract was signed explicitly to work in the action or
− the contract covering the work in the action is additional to the main contract with
the employee but has the same remuneration level as the main contract (i.e. same
hourly/daily rate) or
− part of the work in the action was done during overtime and the overtime hours are
paid at a higher rate resulting from national law, collective agreement or
employment contract, provided that such higher rate does not depend on projects.
For project-based remuneration (Case 1B), the daily rate must be calculated as follows:
Step 1 — Calculate the Case 1B action daily rate per person:
{actual personnel costs for work on the action [incl. project-based supplementary
payments, bonuses, increased salary, etc] during the months within the reporting
period}
divided by
{day-equivalents worked by the person on the action during the months within the
reporting period}
For the calculation of the action daily rate you may include the same elements in the
personnel costs as in Case 1A for the daily rate PLUS all bonuses you paid which were
triggered by the participation in the action (even if those bonuses were not based on
objective conditions). Bonuses triggered by the participation of the employee in other
projects must be excluded.
Step 2 — Compare the action daily rate with the national project daily rate, i.e. the
(theoretical) daily rate that you would pay to the person for work in national projects,
in accordance with your usual remuneration practices. The daily rate to be used for
the EU grant financial statement will be the lower of the two. In other words, if the
action daily rate is higher than the national project daily rate, then you will have to
use the national rate for that reporting period.
‘National projects’ are to be understood in the large sense, meaning all types of
projects funded under any type of national (public or private) funding scheme,
including projects co-financed by EU funds that are managed by EU Member States
(e.g. Regional Funds, Agricultural and Fisheries Funds). This must exclude EU grants
as defined in the Grant Agreement, i.e. actions funded by the EU Commission, EU
executive agencies or other funding bodies, which do not qualify as national projects.
The (theoretical) national project daily rate must be calculated the as follows:
{theoretical personnel costs for similar work in a national project over the same number
of months as the reporting period}
divided by
{maximum declarable day-equivalents}
The remuneration to which the person would be entitled to for work in national
projects must be defined:
− either in regulatory requirements (such as national law or collective labour
agreements)
− or in your written internal remuneration rules.
57EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the regulatory requirements or your written internal remuneration rules:
− provide for a bonus range (e.g. between 500 and 1000; between 10% and
50%) or a maximum ceiling (e.g. up to 50) rather than a precise amount per
day or per hour, the remuneration to which the person would be entitled to
(national project daily rate) is the average of the remuneration that the person
received for work in national projects in the complete year before the end of
the reporting period (e.g. calendar, financial or fiscal year depending on the
beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices) for which data is available (see
further below).
Example: If the beneficiary has calculated the action daily rate for a 18 month-
reporting period from 01/09/2021 to 28/02/2023, the average of the remuneration that
the person received for work in national projects could be calculated based on the data
of the complete calendar year 2022 (if available, otherwise of 2021 or the latest
available calendar, financial or fiscal year before 2021).
− provide for different levels of remuneration depending on the staff category,
the remuneration to which the person would be entitled to is the one of the
category to which the person belongs
− provide for different levels of remuneration depending on the type of
nationally-funded projects (and/or the type of work within these projects), the
remuneration to which the person would be entitled to is the one applicable to
the type of project (and/or work) that is closest to the action
− change over the reporting period, the remuneration to which the person would
be entitled to is the one that was applicable for the larger part of that reporting
period.
If there are no regulatory requirements and you do not have internal rules defining
objective conditions on which the national project daily rate can be determined, but
you can demonstrate that your usual practice is to pay bonuses for work in national
projects, the national project daily rate is the average of the remuneration that the
person received in the last complete year (calendar, financial or fiscal year, see
above) before the end of the reporting period for work in national projects calculated
as follows:
{(total personnel costs of the person in the last complete year) minus (remuneration paid
for EU actions during that complete year)}
divided by
{215 minus (days worked in EU actions during that complete year)}
‘EU actions’ are EU grants as defined in the Grant Agreement (i.e. awarded by EU
institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, including EU executive agencies, EU
regulatory agencies, EDA, joint undertakings).
‘Total personnel costs’ covers all types of contracts with the person that qualify
as personnel costs under Article 6.2.A.
If during the last reference period the person worked for the beneficiary only in EU
grants as defined in the Grant Agreement, you must calculate the national project
daily rate using the year before (or the last year in which the person worked in a
national project).
If the person is a new employee hired in the reporting period, their national project
daily rate, calculated according to the formula above, is the one applicable to the
employee whose base salary (salary without bonuses) is the most similar to that
person’s.
58EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Average personnel costs (option in HE, DEP, CEF, EDF, UCPM, HUMA,) — If this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement , beneficiaries who consistently calculate average rates for
their staff as part of their analytical cost accounting system, can use these average rates for
the daily rate.
You can use this method, provided that:
− the daily rate is calculated using the actual personnel costs recorded in your accounts,
excluding any ineligible cost or costs already included in other budget categories (no
double funding of the same costs)
Therefore, you may have to adjust your usual methodology in order to remove:
− costs that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement
Example: The daily rate in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices contains taxes not linked to the remuneration. Those taxes are ineligible and
must be removed when calculating the daily rates for the action.
− costs that are already included in other budget categories
Example: Beneficiaries whose cost accounting practices for personnel costs include
indirect costs. Indirect costs must be removed from the pool of costs used to calculate
the daily rate charged to the action because indirect costs must be declared using a flat
rate. Personnel costs cannot include any indirect costs.
If your usual methodology includes budgeted or estimated elements, we can only
accept those, if they:
− are relevant (i.e. clearly related to personnel costs)
− are used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not play a major role in the calculation)
− correspond to objective and verifiable information (i.e. their basis is clearly
defined and you can show how they were calculated)
Example: Calculating average 2021 daily rates by using 2020 payroll data and
increasing them by adding the CPI (consumer price index) on which the basic salaries
are indexed.
− you apply your cost accounting practices in a consistent manner, based on objective
criteria that must be verifiable if there is a check, review, audit or investigation. You
must do this no matter who is funding the action.
This does not mean that cost accounting practices must be the same for all your
employees, departments or cost centres. If, for example, your usual cost accounting
practices include different calculation methods for permanent personnel and
temporary personnel, this is acceptable. However, you cannot use different methods
for specific actions, projects or persons on an ad-hoc basis.
Example (acceptable): Individual (actual) personnel costs are used for researchers, average
personnel costs (unit costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices) are used for technical support staff.
Example (unacceptable): Average personnel costs are used to calculate costs in externally-
funded projects only.
If your usual cost accounting practice is to calculate hourly rates instead of daily rates, you
must convert the hourly rate into a daily rate as follows:
Daily rate = hourly rate x 8
Alternative: If you have a usual cost accounting practice determining the standard number of
annual productive hours of a full-time employee, you can alternatively multiply by the
number of hours resulting from the following formula (instead of by 8):
59EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
{The higher of: (the standard number of annual productive hours of a full-time employee
according to your practice) OR (90 % of the standard annual workable hours of a full-time
employee)}

General > Article 6.2.A.2, A3 Natural persons with direct contract and seconded persons
A.2 Natural persons with direct contract and seconded persons (all programmes except
SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
A.2 and A.3 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract other than an employment
contract and costs for seconded persons by a third party against payment are also eligible as personnel
costs, if they are assigned to the action, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and:
(a) work under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way the work is
organised, the tasks that are performed and the premises where they are performed) and
(b) the result of the work belongs to the beneficiary (unless agreed otherwise).
They must be calculated on the basis of a rate which corresponds to the costs actually incurred for the direct
contract or secondment and must not be significantly different from those for personnel performing similar
tasks under an employment contract with the beneficiary.
1. Natural persons with direct contract (A.2) and seconded persons (A.3): Types of
costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS,
CUST/FISC), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Costs for natural persons under
direct contract’ or ‘Costs for seconded persons’.
These budget categories cover the costs of two types of persons:
− self-employed natural persons (e.g. some types of in-house consultants) who work on
the action for the beneficiary under conditions similar to those of an employee, but
under a contract that is legally not an employment contract
− persons who are seconded by a third party against payment.
‘Seconded’ means the temporary transfer of an employee from a third party (the employer)
to the beneficiary. Seconded persons are still paid and employed by the third party, but work
for the beneficiary. They are at the disposal of the beneficiary and work under its control and
instructions. A secondment normally requires the seconded person to work at the
beneficiary’s premises, although in specific cases it may be agreed otherwise in the
secondment agreement.
Best practice: The secondment agreement should detail the conditions of secondment (tasks,
reimbursement from one entity to the other, duration of the secondment, location, etc).
What not? Cost of persons who are employees of the beneficiary, (co)owners of the
beneficiary (if the beneficiary is an SME) or staff provided by a temporary work agency.
1.2 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract and persons seconded against
payment must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs of natural persons with direct contract (A.2) and seconded persons (A.3) must
comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.2 and 6.2.A.3, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration by the beneficiary, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− the person must be hired under either:
− a direct contract signed between you and the natural person (not through
another legal entity; e.g. a temporary work agency) or
61EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− a contract signed between you and a legal entity fully owned by that natural
person, and which has no other staff than the natural person being hired or
− a secondment agreement with the employer of the natural person
− the person must work under conditions similar to those of an employee, in particular:
− the beneficiary must organise and supervise the work of the person in a way
similar to that of its employees
Example (acceptable): The beneficiary's project leader and the person discuss
regularly the work to be carried out for the action. The project leader decides the tasks
and timing of the work and instructs the person accordingly.
Example (not acceptable): The beneficiary's project leader and the person meet only
once a month or irregularly, for updates on the state of play of the entrusted work. If
changes are needed, they have to be agreed by the person and may lead to a change of
the amount charged to the beneficiary.
− the person is subject to similar presence requirements as the employees
Examples (acceptable):
1. The person works physically at the beneficiary's premises, following a time schedule
similar to that of the employees (e.g. the beneficiary authorises up to two days of
teleworking per week to its personnel and the person has chosen to benefit from this
regime, i.e. works 2 days in teleworking and 3 days physically at the beneficiary's
premises).
2. The beneficiary does not require any presence at its premises and allows all its
employees to telework full-time from anywhere in the world. The person choses to
telework from home, i.e. the country where the seconding organisation is established.
Examples (not acceptable):
1. The beneficiary applies a consistent policy of only authorising up to two days of
teleworking per week. However, the person works four days per week in teleworking
and only one day at the beneficiary's premises.
2. The beneficiary applies a consistent policy of requiring all staff to work at its
premises. However, the person works from a country other than the one where the
beneficiary is located.
− the remuneration must be based on working time, rather than on delivering
specific outputs/products.
Similar conditions does not mean equal conditions. The working conditions of the
person do NOT have to be exactly the same that those of an employee, but overall
similar.
− the result of the work carried out (including patents or copyright) must in principle
belong to the beneficiary; if (exceptionally) it belongs to the person, the beneficiary
must (just like for employees) obtain the necessary rights from the person (transfer,
licences or other), in order to be able to respect its obligations under the Grant
Agreement
− the cost of the person must not be significantly different from costs for employees of
the beneficiary performing similar tasks; if the beneficiary does not have employees
performing similar tasks, the comparison must be done with national salary references
of the country where the beneficiary is located, for the staff category to which the
person belongs in the sector of activity of the beneficiary and
− the cost must correspond exclusively to the remuneration of the person and related
eligible taxes.
62EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the costs do not fulfil all the conditions indicated here above, they may be eligible as
purchase of services (see Article 6.2.C.3) or subcontracting (see Article 6.2.B) but NOT as
personnel costs.
Thus, for seconded persons, if the resulting daily rate is higher than the daily rate actually
paid by the third party to the seconded person (applying the calculation rules of the Grant
Agreement) the costs can NOT be declared as personnel costs. They may be eligible instead as
purchase of services (see Article 6.2.C.3) or subcontracting (see Article 6.2.B). The reason is that
in this case the payment made by the beneficiary to the third party would be higher than the
actual remuneration of the person, and this implies that there is a commercial margin (or
other non-personnel cost) that is being charged by the third party to the beneficiary.
1.4 Costs of natural persons working under a direct contract and seconded persons against
payment must be calculated as follows:
{amount per unit [daily rate]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate must be calculated as follows:
− if the contract specifies a daily rate: this daily rate must be used; if the contract fixes
an hourly rate instead of a daily rate, you must convert the hourly rate into a daily
rate (daily rate = hourly rate x 8)
− if the contract states a fixed amount for the work and the number of days to be
worked (or hours; in that case 8 hours = 1 day-equivalent): the global amount for the
work must be divided by the number day-equivalents to be worked
− if the contract states a fixed amount for the work, but does not specify the number of
days (or hours) that must be worked: the global amount for the work must be divided
by the pro-rata of 215 annual day-equivalents which corresponds to the duration of
the contract over the reporting period
Example: The contract provides that the person will work at the beneficiary's premises for
assisting in action tasks. The contract is for 6 months starting on 01/01/2021 and ending on
30/06/2021. According to its time records, the person worked 60 day-equivalents in the action
over that period. The contract sets a monthly payment of EUR 3 000 but does not explicitly
establish the number of days/hours to be worked.
Personnel costs for the action = 60 (day-equivalents worked in the action) x daily rate
Daily rate = annual personnel costs / pro-rata of 215 = (3 000 € x 6 months) / (215 x (6
months/12 months)) = 18 000 € / (215 x 0,5) = 18 000 € / 107,5 days = 167,44 €/day
Personnel costs for the action = 60 x 167,44 = 10 046,4€.
Cost elements that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (even if they are part of the
amount stated in the contract) must be removed from the calculation of the personnel cost.
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — If a pro-rata number of 215 annual day-equivalents is used
in the calculation of the amount per unit (daily rate), you must respect the horizontal ceiling (see
Article 6.2.A.1).
Maximum declarable day-equivalents — If a number of day-equivalents (specified directly
in the contract or determined via a pro-rata of 215 day-equivalents) is used in the calculation of
the amount per unit (daily rate), you can NOT declare more day-equivalents worked on the action
than the number of day-equivalents used to calculate the daily rate.
63EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Specific cases (costs for natural persons with direct contract and seconded
personnel (A.2, A.3)):
Persons seconded against payment from a third party located in a different country
than the beneficiary — As salary levels are not homogeneous across different countries,
the remuneration of the person paid by the third party, and so the actual costs paid for the
secondment, might be higher than those paid by the beneficiary for employees performing
similar tasks. In that case, the actual costs paid for the secondment can still be considered
eligible, if the beneficiary can demonstrate that its usual practice is to pay for secondments at
the level of the actual remuneration of the seconded person.
Secondment of staff between beneficiaries/affiliated entities — Is allowed, but it is
the beneficiary/affiliated entity who employs the person who has to declare its costs (NOT the
beneficiary/affiliated to whom the person has been seconded).
Fellowships, scholarships, stipends, internship or similar agreements (not
employees) — Costs for persons (e.g. students, PhDs and other researchers) under
fellowships, scholarships, stipends, internship or similar agreements, through which they
work for the beneficiary on the action (without having an employment contract) can be
accepted, if the agreement is work-oriented (as opposed to training-oriented: i.e. not aimed
at helping the student to acquire professional skills).
Such cost can be charged to the action as personnel costs, if they fulfil the conditions set out
in Article 6.1 and 6.2.A.2, and in particular:
− the assignment of tasks and the remuneration complies with the applicable national
law (e.g. on taxes, labour and social security)
− the recipients of fellowships, scholarships and stipends have the necessary
qualifications to carry out the tasks allocated to them under the action.
PhD agreements are considered work-oriented. However, time for training, if any, may NOT
be charged to the action.
Fellowships, scholarships and stipends, etc. that are not work-oriented are cannot be charged
as personnel costs, but may be eligible as financial support to third parties (FSTP; cost
category D.1), if explicitly allowed by the call conditions and in line with Annex 1 (see Article
6.2.D.1).
Cost for exemptions from academic fees (HE) — The fees (or the fee exemption) are
eligible as personnel cost, if the student contract includes the amount of waived fees as part
of their remuneration. The other conditions set out in Article 6 have to be fulfilled as well
(e.g. the full remuneration, included the value of the waived fees, must be recorded in the
university’s accounts).

General > Article 6.2.A.4 SME owners and natural person beneficiaries
A.4 SME owners and natural person beneficiaries (all programmes except SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI)
[additional OPTION for programmes with SME owner unit cost: A.4 The work of SME owners for the
action (i.e. owners of beneficiaries that are small and medium-sized enterprises20 not receiving a salary) or
natural person beneficiaries (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary) may be
declared as personnel costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.]
20 For the definition, see Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC: micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) are enterprises
- engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of their legal form (including, in particular, self- employed persons and family
businesses engaged in craft or other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity) and
- employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Recommendation) and
which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43
million.
1. SME owners and natural person beneficiaries (A.4): Types of costs — Forms —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS, EUAF,
CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘SME owner/natural
person beneficiary costs’.
This budget category covers the costs of two types of persons:
− Persons who are directly owners or co-owners (regardless of their percentage of
ownership) of the beneficiary, if the beneficiary is an SME and the person is not an
employee of the beneficiary. It applies also to SME owners whose work in the action
for the beneficiary is remunerated via any type of non-employment contract (e.g. a
service contract), via profit distribution or by any remuneration method other than a
salary resulting from an employment contract.
− Beneficiaries who are natural persons; i.e. who signed the Grant Agreement on
her/his own name as individuals, not on behalf of another legal person (e.g. a
company).
‘Directly’ means not owners (or co-owners) through another company owned by them.
What not? SME owners who receive a salary (registered as such in the accounts of the SME)
cannot declare personnel costs under this budget category, unless they can show that this
salary corresponds exclusively to the management of the SME (and is therefore not linked to
the action).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit cost, using the unit cost (daily rate) fixed by the
authorising decision C(2020)71156 and set out in Annex 2a.
6 Commission Decision of 20 October 2020 authorising the use of unit costs for the personnel costs of the owners
of small and medium-sized enterprises and beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary for the
work carried out by themselves under an action or work programme (C(2020)7715).
65EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The amount per unit (daily rate) is prefixed in the authorising decision, adjusted depending
on the country where the beneficiary/affiliated entity is established:
Amount per unit [daily rate] = {EUR 5 080 /18 days [i.e. 282,22]}
multiplied by
{country-specific correction coefficient of the country where the
beneficiary is established}
The country-specific correction coefficient is the one for HE MSCA actions (see Horizon Europe
Work Programme > Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions in force at the time of the call).
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.4, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be declared for an SME owner/natural person beneficiary, who works on the action but
does not receive a salary.
The granting authority may verify that the beneficiary fulfils the conditions for using this unit
cost.
1.4 The costs must be calculated, for the SME owner/natural person, in accordance with the
methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the SME owner/natural person personnel costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed in the authorising decision (see above).
The calculation itself is automated by the IT system. The beneficiary/affiliated entity must
only indicate the number of days worked on the action and the system will then correctly
calculate the personnel costs (based on the parameters described above).
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — For SME owner/natural person beneficiaries unit costs, the
horizontal ceiling (see Article 6.2.A.1) applies not only in case of work on multiple actions, but also
where the person worked in only one EU grant during a given calendar year.

A.5 Volunteers (ERDF-TA, LIFE, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV, JUST, ESF/SOCPL,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM, RELEX)
[additional OPTION for programmes with volunteers costs: A.5 The work of volunteers for the action (i.e.
persons who freely work for an organisation, on a non-compulsory basis and without being paid) may be
declared as personnel costs, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.
They:
- may not exceed the maximum amount for volunteers for the action (which corresponds to 50% of the
total (ineligible and eligible) project costs and contributions estimated in the proposal)
- may not exceed the maximum amount for volunteers for each beneficiary set out in Annex 2
- may not make the maximum EU contribution to costs higher than the total eligible costs without
volunteers.
If also indirect costs for volunteers are declared eligible in the call conditions, the amount of indirect costs
may be added to the volunteers costs category in Annex 2, at the flat-rate set out in Point E.]
1. Volunteers (A.5): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (ERDF-TA, LIFE, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV,
JUST, ESF/SOCPL, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM, RELEX), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Volunteers costs’.
This budget category allows to increase the grant amount in order to recognise the
contribution of volunteers in the project, i.e. when persons work for the beneficiary, on a
non-compulsory basis and without being paid.
What not? The unit costs for volunteers work do not cover any actual costs which might be
incurred and paid by the beneficiary, such as insurance, social security, travel or subsistence
costs. Any such costs can be declared and reimbursed separately (if provided for in the call
conditions).
1.2. The work carried out by volunteers can be declared as unit cost, using the unit cost
fixed by the authorising decision C(2019)26467 and set out in Annex 2a.
The amount per unit (daily rate) is prefixed in the authorising decision, depending on the
country where the volunteering activity takes place:

1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.5, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)).
In addition, a double cap must be applied to limit the amounts declared for volunteers' work
or the amount of the total EU contribution:
− the total EU contribution must be less than the total eligible costs excluding volunteer
work.
− the amounts declared for volunteers work must also not exceed the maximum amount
for volunteers for each beneficiary set out in Annex 2.
1.4. The costs must be calculated, for the volunteer working on the action, in accordance
with the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the volunteer personnel costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate depending on country]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed in the authorising decision (see above).
If a use per hour is necessary, you must convert the daily rate as follows: hourly rate = daily
rate / 8).
68EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If explicitly allowed by the call conditions, you can also add indirect costs to the volunteers
costs.
This calculation is however not automated in the system (i.e. the automatically calculated
indirect costs in cost category E will not include this extra amount). If you want to charge the
indirect costs, you must add them manually to the costs in cost category A.5 Volunteers
costs, on top of the direct volunteers costs (i.e. calculate the indirect volunteers costs:
{indirect cost flat rate x direct volunteers costs} and add this amount to the volunteers costs
in cost category A.5).

[additional OPTION for programmes with other personnel cost categories: A.6 [insert name of specific
personnel cost category and eligibility conditions].]]
1. Other personnel costs (A.6): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Other personnel costs’.
Such cost categories exist currently only in a limited number of EU programmes (HE, SMP
ESS, CUST/FISC):
− HE personnel unit cost (see Article 6.2.A.6 HE_Personnel unit costs)
− SMP ESS personnel costs based on time (see Article 6.2.A.6 SMP_ESS_Personnel unit
costs based on time)
− SMP ESS personnel costs based on deliverables (see Article 6.2.A.7 SMP_ESS
Personnel unit costs based on deliverables)
− Customs/Fiscalis personnel costs (see Article 6.2.A.6 CUST/FISC_Personnel unit costs)
1.2 Depending on the provisions of the specific personnel cost categories, they must be
declared as actual costs (or any other cost type, e.g. unit cost, flat rate or lump sum).
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in each specific personnel
cost category.
1.4 The calculation method will depend on the type of cost and the provisions of each
specific personnel cost category.

General > Article 6.2.A.6 > HE Personnel unit costs
A.6 HE Personnel unit cost
[additional OPTION for HE: A.6 For beneficiaries with personnel unit cost, the personnel costs under
categories A.1-A.4 must be declared as unit cost and are eligible, if they fulfil the general eligibility
conditions, are calculated as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a and comply with
the conditions set out in Points A.1-A.4 for the underlying types of costs (personnel).]
1. HE Personnel unit cost (A.6): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for all Horizon Europe types of action which are
mixed actual cost grants (e.g. RIA, CSA, PCP/PPI, COFUND, ERC, EIC, EIT).
This cost category is optional in the sense that it is granted only on request. However,
once the unit cost is approved, it must be used in all HE actions (i.e. new proposals
submitted after the approval date and not yet signed grants under preparation; and
including to calculate personnel costs for lump sum grants in the proposal’s detailed
budget table).
The approved unit cost is valid for at least two years. You may request an update to
the unit cost amount, every two years after the approval date, until 31 December 2027.
The updated unit cost will apply to all the beneficiary’s Horizon Europe and Euratom
proposals that are invited to grant preparation after the new approval date.
You may change your mind ONCE. After the approval you may, if needed, request to
revert back to actual personnel costs (i.e. charging costs under categories A1 to A4), for
all future grants signed after the unit cost is withdrawn (ongoing grants would not be
impacted). Please be aware that if you revert back to actual costs, you will not be able to
request again the use of the personnel unit cost for the rest of the MFF period 2021-2027.
For beneficiaries/affiliated entities that have selected this unit cost, they must (once
approved) charge all their personnel costs under ‘HE Personnel unit cost’.
This budget category replaces categories A1-A4 (A.1 Employees, A.2 Natural persons with
direct contract, A.3 Seconded persons against payment, or A.4 SME owners and natural
person beneficiaries) and covers the cost of all personnel that works on HE actions.
What not? Cost category A.6 can NOT be used to declare costs for personnel with other
kinds of working relationships (e.g. staff provided by a temporary work agency must still be
declared either as purchase of services or subcontracting).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs, using the unit cost (daily rate) approved by
the granting authority in accordance with the HE personnel unit cost authorising decision8 and
set out in Annex 2a.
8 Decision of 15 January 2024 authorising the use of unit costs for personnel costs for actions under the Horizon
Europe and Euratom Programmes.
71EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The precise unit cost (daily rate, i.e. EUR/day) is not prefixed by the authorising decision. It
must be calculated and approved for each beneficiary/affiliated entity organisation in the
Portal Participant Register.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (daily rate) is:
Amount per unit [daily rate] = {total staff costs of the beneficiary in the last closed full financial
year9}
divided by
{annual work units in the last closed full financial year²}
divided by
{215 days}
The result is subject to a maximum cap per country.
{EUR 9 618 multiplied by the corresponding country-specific correction coefficient
divided by
18 days}
The country-specific correction coefficient is the one for HE MSCA actions (see Horizon Europe
Work Programme > Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions in force at the time of the approval).
You can make a test calculation by using the wizard available on the Portal.
In order to formally request the use of the personnel unit cost, the request must be
submitted by the organisation’s legal entity authorised representative (LEAR) through the
Portal (by entering total staff costs in the last closed full financial year, number of annual
work units and country of establishment). It must be supported by an audit certificate
(template to be used) provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent
and complies with Directive 2006/43/EC (or for public bodies: by a competent independent
public officer. The amount approved will be accessible in the Portal Participant Register.
The granting authority may verify that the provided data in the audit certificate match those
in the statutory annual accounts and/or other official documents on which the audit certificate
was delivered (and correct it, if needed).
For more information concerning the unit cost validation procedure, see HE Personnel unit cost
validation procedure.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.6, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b))
− be calculated in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a
− be declared based on the number of day-equivalents for persons working on the action
and
9 At the moment of the request for the unit cost (or the request for its update).
72EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− comply with the specific conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.1-A.4 for the underlying
types of costs. This means that costs can be declared in category A.6 only for
personnel who have a working relationship with the beneficiary/affiliated entity falling
under the categories A.1 Employees, A.2 Natural persons with direct contract, A.3
Seconded persons against payment, or A.4 SME owners and natural person
beneficiaries. Since in HE in-kind contributions are eligible, cost category A.6 may also
be used for seconded persons free-of-charge who have such a working relationship
with a third party (e.g. an employee of a third party seconded free-of-charge to the
beneficiary).
1.4 The costs must be calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the
authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the HE personnel unit costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate approved in the Portal Participant Register]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed by the granting authority in the Participant Register, based on the rate
requested by the beneficiary/affiliated entity (see above).
The calculation itself is automated by the IT system. The beneficiary/affiliated entity must
only indicate the number of days worked on the action and the system will then correctly
calculate the personnel costs (based on the parameters described above)
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — For HE Personnel unit costs, the horizontal ceiling (see Article
6.2.A.1) applies not only in case of work on multiple actions, but also where the person worked in
only one EU grant during a given calendar year.

General > Article 6.2.A.6 and A.7 > SMP ESS Personnel costs and SMP ESS personnel costs based on deliverables
A.6 and A.7 SMP ESS Personnel costs
[OPTION 2 for European Statistics: A.6 ESS personnel costs based on time spent are eligible, if and as
declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as
unit cost in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2b and the following:
{daily rate
multiplied by
number of actual days worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The number of actual days declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 20).
The daily rate is the rate of the pay grade set out in Annex 2b (or — for personnel without an applicable pay
grade — the rate of the grade with the closest basic salary).
A.7 ESS personnel costs based on deliverables (e.g. number of conducted interviews, number of translated
pages) are eligible, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general eligibility
conditions and are calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred (i.e. limited to the amount per
deliverable, including social security contributions, taxes or other costs included in the remuneration, if they
arise from national law or the contract) and the following:
{amount per deliverable
multiplied by
number of deliverables produced for the action}.]

1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for all SMP ESS actions.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge their personnel costs under
‘ESS personnel costs based on time’.
This budget category replaces categories A.1-A.5 and covers the cost of all personnel that
works on SMP ESS actions based on time (i.e. not deliverables).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs, using the individual unit cost salary grid (daily
rates) agreed with the granting authority (see SMP ESS authorising decision10 and Annex 2a
and 2b).
The precise unit cost (daily rates, i.e. EUR/day) is not prefixed by the authorising decision. It
must be calculated for each grant and then entered into the unit cost table in Annex 2b of the
Grant Agreement.
10 Decision of 6 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for eligible personnel costs for actions implemented by
Eurostat.
74EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For more information concerning the salary grid validation, see SMP ESS Unit cost grid
validation procedure.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.6, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be declared for a person working on the action, based on time.
1.4 The costs must be calculated, for each person, in accordance with the methodology set
out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the ESS personnel costs based on time is:
{amount per unit [daily rate depending on salary grid fixed in Annex 2b]}
multiplied by
{number of days worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed by the granting authority, based on the salary grids of the
beneficiary/affiliated entity in Annex 2b (see above).
2. SMP ESS personnel costs based on deliverables (A7): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
2.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for all SMP ESS actions.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge their personnel costs under
‘ESS personnel costs based on deliverables’.
This budget category replaces categories A.1-A.5 and covers the cost of personnel that works
on SMP ESS actions based on deliverables (e.g. persons paid per survey).
2.2 The costs must be declared as actual costs.
2.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.7, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
and
− be declared for a person working on the action, based on deliverables.
2.4 The costs must correspond to the costs actually incurred, calculated, for each person,
as follows:
{amount per deliverable}
multiplied by
{number of deliverables produced for the action}

A.6 Customs/Fiscalis personnel costs
A.6 Customs/Fiscalis personnel costs are eligible, if (and in as far as) declared eligible in the call conditions
and if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit cost in accordance with the
method set out in Annex 2a and the following:
{daily rate
multiplied by
number of actual days worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The number of actual days declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 20).
The daily rate is the rate of the pay grade set out in Annex 2a (or — for personnel without an applicable pay
grade — the rate of the grade with the closest basic salary).

B. Subcontracting costs
B. Subcontracting costs
[OPTION 1 for programmes without subcontracting (ineligible):
Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with subcontracting (standard):
Subcontracting costs for the action (including related duties, taxes and charges[OPTION for programmes
with VAT eligible:, such as non-deductible or non-refundable value added tax (VAT))]) are eligible, if they
are calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are
awarded using the beneficiary’s usual purchasing practices — provided these ensure subcontracts with best
value for money (or if appropriate the lowest price) and that there is no conflict of interests (see Article 12).
Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU Directives on public
procurement must also comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.
[additional OPTION for programmes with additional subcontracting rules: [OPTION if selected for the
call21: In addition, if the value of the subcontracts to be awarded exceeds EUR […], the beneficiaries must
comply with the following rules: […].]]
[additional OPTION for programmes with country restrictions for subcontracting costs: [OPTION if
selected for the call: The beneficiaries must ensure that the subcontracted work is performed in the eligible
countries or target countries set out in the call conditions — unless otherwise approved by the granting
authority.]]
[[OPTION if selected for the grant22: Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the action.]]
The tasks to be subcontracted and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1 and the
total estimated costs of subcontracting per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2 (or may be approved ex
post in the periodic report, if the use of subcontracting does not entail changes to the Agreement which would
call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants;
‘simplified approval procedure’).]
21 If the RAO decides to set specific rules, they must be set out in the call and take into account the value of the contracts and the relative
size of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk (proportionality). Specific rules may only be set for the
award of contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000.
22 This is a standard obligation for all EU grants. It may be unselected only for actions where subcontracting is a key/large part of the action
(e.g infrastructure projects; PCP/PPI; technical assistance, statistical programmes, etc).
1. Subcontracting costs (B.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes), beneficiaries/affiliated
entities may charge ‘Subcontracting costs’.
This budget category covers subcontracted action tasks, i.e. contracts for parts of the project
described in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1) that are not implemented by the
beneficiary itself, but by a subcontractor.
78EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Subcontracts are normally wide in scope (implementation of a part of the project, i.e.
action tasks). If a contract covers only individual equipment or consumables that do not
constitute an action task by itself, this will be considered as a purchase (see Article 6.2.C.2
and C.3).
Only limited parts of the action may be subcontracted — unless explicitly allowed in
the call conditions/Grant Agreement. Limited parts means that subcontracting remains
proportionate both in terms of share and type of subcontracted action tasks, as well as in
terms of share in the eligible cost. The acceptable limit is assessed by the granting
authority based on the nature of the action, which may vary between programmes and
calls. For some programmes with large infrastructure projects (e.g. CEF), it is
systematically disactivated.
1.2 Subcontracting costs must be declared as actual costs.
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.B, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− be based either on the best value for money (considering the quality of the service,
good or work proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest price
− not be subject to conflict of interest and
− for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ within the
meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24, 2014/25 and
2009/81)12: comply with the applicable national law on public procurement; these
rules normally provide for special procurement procedures for the types of contracts
they cover.
The beneficiaries can in principle freely choose between best value for money and lowest
price.
Best value for money applies the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial
management) to the subcontracting context.
A competitive selection of subcontractors should be the default approach since it is the safest
way to ensure no conflict of interest, best value for money or lowest price through direct
comparisons between offers. However, subcontracting does not necessarily require
competitive selection procedures to be eligible, provided that, in case of a check, review,
audit or investigation, the beneficiary can prove compliance with best value for money or
lowest price AND no conflict of interest, for instance by showing:
− data from a previous competitive tender on a similar subject that confirms the market
value
− a conducted market consultation, e.g. price quotations, supplier brochures, or
consultation with help of independent experts

79EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− that no suitable offers have been submitted in response to a prior competitive
selection procedure
− that a subcontractor is in a monopoly situation due to technical reasons; or exclusive
(intellectual property) rights; or acquisition of a unique work of art or artistic
performance; or that the task can only be performed by an international organisation
which cannot participate in competitive procedures according to its statutes
− that the subcontractor is the winner of a prior competitive design contest under the
action or a linked action
− a need for special security measures in order to protect the essential interests of the
EU or Member States in accordance with the call conditions.
The beneficiary must be able to demonstrate that the criteria defining quality were clear and
coherent with the purpose.
Best practice: It is recommended to entrust the decision of awarding a contract to an
evaluation committee rather than to a sole person. Members of the evaluation committee
should be aware that they need to disclose the existence of a conflict of interest. The
beneficiary should have clear rules and guidance on situations of conflict of interest. These
rules should provide information on who to contact for advice or disclose the conflict to and,
where necessary, the appropriate action. It is good practice that staff involved in the
procurement process formally signs a declaration of no conflict of interests before performing
their duties.
Subcontracts (tasks to be subcontracted and estimated costs; not necessarily the
subcontractor, especially if not yet known) must be justified in Annex 1 (simplified approval
procedure allowed; see below).
1.4 Regarding the calculation, the amount charged as eligible cost must correspond to the
amount invoiced by the subcontractor.
Specific cases (subcontracting costs (B.)):
Simplified approval procedure (new subcontracts) — If the need for a subcontract was
not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to
introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report (simplified approval
procedure). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting
authority might not approve the new subcontract and reject the costs at interim or final
payment-stage later on.
Subcontracting in actions affecting security or public order (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF) —
If provided for in the call conditions, the simplified approval procedure is NOT allowed and
specific participation conditions and cost eligibility criteria may apply to subcontracting in
actions that concern essential interest of the EU and its Member States.
Subcontracting of action tasks involving classified information — Action tasks
involving EU classified information may ONLY be subcontracted (cumulative conditions):
− to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission) and
− if the granting authority has explicitly approved such requests in writing (see Article
13.2 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).

other tasks listed in Article 7) — Can NOT be subcontracted (they can only be delegated,
under certain circumstances, to an entity with ‘authorisation to administer’ or in the case of
‘sole beneficiaries’ within the meaning of Article 190(2) of the Financial Regulation
2024/250913; see Article 7).
Subcontracting to beneficiaries — Is NOT allowed in the same grant. All beneficiaries
contribute to and are interested in the action; if one beneficiary needs the services of another
in order to perform its part of the work it is the second beneficiary who should declare its
own costs for that work.
Subcontracting to affiliates — Is normally NOT allowed in the same grant. As for
subcontracting between beneficiaries (see above), affiliated entities participating in the action
should declare instead their own cost for that work. Subcontracting to affiliated entities not
participating in the action is possible only exceptionally e.g. in case of monopoly or where
they have a framework contract (affiliate is their usual provider). The subcontracting still
needs to comply with the general and specific cost eligibility conditions, in particular ensure
best value for money or lowest price and avoid any conflict of interest. As best practice, these
affiliates should rather be added to the action, be identified as affiliated entities under Article
8 and declare their own costs for that work.
Subcontracting to associated partners or third parties giving in-kind contributions
— Exceptionally possible, e.g. in case of monopoly or where they have a framework contract
(the associated partner or third party giving in-kind contributions is their usual provider) and
provided that the Annex 1 DoA explains clearly what tasks the participant will perform as
associated partner, or contribute to as third party giving in-kind contributions and what tasks
will be performed as subcontractor (the latter remaining the responsibility of the
subcontracting beneficiary). The subcontracting needs to comply with the general and specific
eligibility conditions, in particular ensure best value for money or lowest price and avoid any
conflict of interest.
Framework contracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if this is
the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of service). In order to be eligible, the
framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money or
lowest price and absence of conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily
have to be concluded before the start of the action.

[OPTION 2 for programmes with purchase costs (standard):
Purchase costs for the action (including related duties, taxes and charges[OPTION for programmes with
VAT eligible:, such as non-deductible or non-refundable value added tax (VAT)]) are eligible if they fulfil
the general eligibility conditions and are bought using the beneficiary’s usual purchasing practices —
provided these ensure purchases with best value for money (or if appropriate the lowest price) and that there
is no conflict of interests (see Article 12).
Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU Directives on public
procurement must also comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.

1. Purchase costs (C.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Purchase costs’.
This budget category covers, depending on the options that apply, the following sub-
categories:
− Travel, accommodation and subsistence (see Article 6.2.C.1)
− Equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2)
− Other goods, works or services, if necessary to implement the action (see Article
6.2.C.3).
Purchase contracts are normally limited in scope. If a contract covers the
implementation of action tasks, this will be considered as a case of subcontracting (see
Article 6.2.B).
1.2 Depending on the provisions in the Grant Agreement, purchase costs must be declared
as actual costs or unit cost (unit cost is provided for travel and subsistence costs for instance
in EMFAF, IMCAP, SMP, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV, JUST, ESF/SOCPL, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, TSI, UCPM).
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred/units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a) and (b))
82EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− be based either on the best value for money (considering the quality of the service,
good or work proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest price
− not be subject to conflict of interest and
− for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ within the
meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24, 2014/25 and
2009/81)14: comply with the applicable national law on public procurement; these
rules normally provide for special procurement procedures for the types of contracts
they cover.
The beneficiaries can in principle freely choose between best value for money and lowest
price.
Best value for money applies the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial
management) to the purchasing context. It does NOT necessarily require competitive
selection procedures. However, if a beneficiary did not request several offers, it must — in
case of a check, review, audit or investigation — be able to show that the price was market-
value and that the criteria defining quality were clear and coherent with the purposes of the
purchase (for detailed guidance, see cost category 6.2.B above).
Selecting the lowest price may be appropriate for automatic award procedures where the
contract is awarded to the company that meets the conditions and quotes the lowest price
(e.g. electronic tendering for consumables).
1.4 The calculation method depends on the type of cost (depreciation, actual or unit cost;
see below).
Specific cases (purchase costs (C.)):
Purchases between participants — Are in principle not accepted. If a beneficiary needs
supplies from another beneficiary, it is the latter beneficiary that should charge them to the
action as cost. (Otherwise there is the risk that the grant is used to charge commercial profit
margins.) Purchases between participants will only be accepted in exceptional and properly
justified cases. For detailed explanations, see the specific cases in Article 6.2.B on
subcontracting between different types of participants.
Framework contracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if this is
the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of goods). In order to be eligible, the
framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money or
lowest price and absence of conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily
have to be concluded before the start of the action.
Providers of research infrastructures services for transnational and virtual access of
users (HE) — The reimbursement of their costs by the beneficiaries will be considered as a
specific purchase of services which will be specified in Annex 1. If (e.g. due to the applicable
national law) an entity providing research infrastructure services cannot issue an invoice to a
beneficiary, but is paid or reimbursed via any other form of transaction, this can be
assimilated to an invoice and accepted as eligible purchase costs.

83EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best value for money can be assured if the providers do not make a profit and their access
costs are calculated according to a well-defined methodology. To this extent, sufficient details
must be provided, such as name of the service providers, purchase costs and object, as well
as the explanation why these service providers are needed and why the purchase costs of the
services are appropriate.
Example: Beneficiaries can explain why these providers of scientific services are necessary for the
action, confirm that they will not include any profit margin when being reimbursed by the
beneficiaries; that they will bear part of the access costs to the research infrastructure (because
some of their costs will not be reimbursed like depreciation costs of their equipments).
Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the granting authority, if they intend to amend the
grant to change a specific purchase of service assessed during proposal evaluation or to
introduce a new specific purchase of service during the action implementation.

General > Article 6.2.C.1 Travel and subsistence
C.1 Travel and subsistence (all programmes except RFCS, CCEI)
C.1 Travel and subsistence
[OPTION 1 for programmes without travel and subsistence costs (ineligible):
Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with travel and subsistence costs:
Purchases for travel, accommodation and subsistence must be calculated as follows:
- travel: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line with the
beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]
- accommodation: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line
with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]
- subsistence: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line with
the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]. ]
1. Travel and subsistence costs (actual costs) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the actual cost option (HE, DEP, EDF,
CEF, LIFE, AGRIP, HUMA, RELEX), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Travel and
subsistence costs’ as actual costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘actual costs’ (NOT ‘unit or actual costs’;
see Data Sheet, Point 3).
This budget category covers travels and related accommodation and subsistence allowances
needed for the action. For some programmes, it is specifically broken down in the following
sub-categories:
− Travel
− Accommodation
− Subsistence.
1.2 If the actual costs option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the costs must be
declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.1, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a)) and
− be in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel.
85EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The travels for which costs are claimed must be necessary for the action (e.g. to present a
paper explaining the results at a conference). Travel costs related to an event at which the
beneficiary carried out work that was not specifically related to the action are NOT eligible.
All travel costs must be limited to the needs of the action; costs related to extensions (for
other professional or private reasons) are NOT eligible.
Moreover, they must be adequately recorded.
Costs for breakfast for an overnight stay (if not included in the cost of the hotel room) can be
charged (as subsistence costs) to the action if it is the beneficiary’s normal practice to
reimburse them.
Costs of a combined travel (i.e. where the end point of travel is different from the start) can
be charged to the action ONLY up to the cost that would have been incurred if the travel
would have been made exclusively for the action (i.e. up to the theoretical cost of travelling
directly back to the start point) AND if:
− it is the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay for such travels (e.g. travels combining
professional and personal reasons)
− it has been an actual cost for the beneficiary.
Record-keeping — In the case of combined travel, the beneficiary must keep records of
not only the actual cost of the subsequent travel leg(s), but also of the theoretical direct
return travel after the end of the work for the action in order to prove the cost that would
have been incurred.
If the beneficiary reimburses travel and/or subsistence allowances as a per diem payment, it
is the per diem amount that is considered an eligible cost, NOT the actual prices paid by the
person receiving the per diem. (For the purposes of the grant, these per diem costs remain
actual costs, NOT simplified forms such as unit costs). They must be recorded in the
beneficiary’s accounts and will be checked if there is an audit.
1.4 There is no specific calculation method; the costs must correspond to the eligible costs
actually incurred (amounts paid for the travel, accommodation and subsistence).
Best practice: Beneficiaries that have special/atypical/particularly expensive travel plans
should contact the granting authority for advice.
Record-keeping — In terms of record-keeping, the beneficiary must keep evidence of the
actual costs incurred as well as evidence that the instance of travel fulfils the general eligibility
conditions for actual costs (for example that the travel was linked to the action).
2. Travel and subsistence costs (unit costs) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
2.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the unit cost option (most
programmes, e.g. I3, ERDF-TA, IMREG, EMFAF, IMCAP, SMP, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV, JUST,
ESF/SOCPL, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, EUAF, CUST/FISC, PERI (partial), TSI, UCPM), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Travel and subsistence costs’ as unit costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘unit or actual costs’ (NOT ‘actual
costs’; see Data Sheet, Point 3).
86EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This budget category covers travels needed for the action, broken down in the following sub-
categories:
− Travel
− Accommodation
− Subsistence.
2.2 If the unit cost option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the costs must be declared
using the unit cost fixed by the authorising decision C(2021)3515 and set out in Annex 2a.
Which unit cost? Check the opening date of your call — the unit costs that you must use
for your grant will always depend on the date on which the call for proposals was opened.
Land travel’ means:
- for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: trips between 50 and 399 km by any
form of land-based travel (bus, rail or car) and trips above 400km by rail
- for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: trips between 50 and 399 km by any
form of land-based travel, and trips between 400 and 600 km by rail.
Travel below 50km will not be reimbursed using the travel unit costs. Such costs can be
reimbursed using actual costs, if it is the usual practice of the beneficiary to reimburse such
short-distance travel.
If a particular instance of travel, accommodation or subsistence in the action is not covered
by one of the unit costs mentioned in the authorising decision C(2021)35, actual costs may
be used (in same way as ‘Travel and subsistence as actual costs’ above).
In practice, this is usually the case for:
− travel between 50 and 399km in a non-EU country
− travel between 50 and 399km between a Member State and a non-EU country (except
for land-based travel between Member States and bordering countries for calls with
opening date as from 31 July 2024)
− land travel between 50 and 399km in LU, CY or MT
− ferry or boat travel from island to island or island to mainland
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: land travel above 400 km or above
600 km where specific unit costs for distances between 400 and 600 km are provided
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: journeys less than 400 km which
necessitate air travel because land travel is not possible or appropriate (see specific
case below).
The amounts per unit are prefixed by the authorising decision.
2.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.1, in
particular:
15 Commission Decision of 12 January 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for travel, accommodation and
subsistence costs under an action or work programme under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework
(C(2021)35) as amended by Commission Decision C(2023)4928 of 26.07.2023.
87EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be purchased for the action and in accordance with Article 6.2.C.
2.4 The costs must be calculated, for each travel and person travelling, in accordance with
the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
Regarding travel:
The formulas for calculating the travel are:
- for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024:
− by air above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x number of journeys}
− by rail above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x number of journeys}
− combined air and rail above 400 km: {amount depending on distance band x number of
journeys}
− land travel (50 – 399km) in 1 Member State: {amount for intra-Member State x number of
journeys}
− land travel (50-399km) between 2 Member States: {amount for inter-Member State travel
x number of journeys}
− travel between EU and one of EU’s outermost regions and overseas countries and territories
(OCTs)5: {specific unit cost for that OCT x number of journeys}
− journey of less than 400 km not covered by land transport (e.g. Helsinki/Tallinn): {unit
cost for air travel (400-600 km) x number of journeys}
− travel to/from places more than 400 km from a primary airport (e.g. certain regions in
Finland): {relevant unit cost for air travel x 150% number of journeys}
- for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024:
– by air or combined air and rail above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x
number of journeys}
– land travel in 1 Member State (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600k where relevant): {amount for
intra-Member State x number of journeys}
– land travel between 2 Member States (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600k where relevant):
{amount for inter-Member State travel x number of journeys}
– land travel between a Member State and a bordering country (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600
km where relevant): {amount for Member State and specific connection x number of
journeys}
All unit costs are an amount to cover a return trip. However, the calculation of the distance
should be done on the basis of the 1-way distance between the points.
For calculating the ‘distance’ between two points for land or air travel, beneficiaries must
use the distance calculators available on the Europa website.
88EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Enter start and end points of your travel. Do NOT enter intermediate stops, transfer
locations etc.
The distance calculators are mandatory. The distance produced by the calculators is the
only distance that can be used for the calculation of the unit costs — even if this does not
correspond to the actual distance of the travel.
Example: For example, the land travel calculator defines the distance between towns A and B as 380
km. However, because the train line deviates slightly to also serve town C, the actual distance travelled
is 410 km. For the purposes of the unit cost, only the distance of 380 km between towns A and B is
relevant (as calculated by the distance calculator).
The start and end-points entered will normally be the place of employment of the person and
the location of the meeting.
If, following the event, the person will travel to a place other than the start point, the amount
to be declared will be the theoretical cost of returning to the same starting point, unless the
different destination is necessary for the implementation of the action. In that case, the unit
cost can be calculated using the longer of the distances (e.g. if travel from Dublin – Brussels
– Athens is justified for the action, the unit cost to be applied can be calculated on basis of
the longer flight from Brussels – Athens).
Where the trip involves 3 journeys and is necessary for the implementation of the action (e.g.
Madrid – Brussels – Berlin – Madrid), the unit costs can be calculated on the basis of 2
separate return flights: Madrid – Brussels and Berlin – Madrid.
For checking the distance of travel to/from places more than 400km from a primary airport,
the following are the ‘primary airports’ to be used (— only relevant for calls with opening
date before 31 July 2024; for calls as from 31 July 2024, primary airports are no longer
relevant and instead the amount is determined solely by calculating the distance in the
normal way using the distance calculator):

Regarding accommodation:
The formula for calculating the accommodation is:
{amount per unit [depending on country]}
multiplied by
{nights spent on travel}
For the EU’s outermost regions or OCTs, the rate for the relevant Member State can be used
as a proxy amount (— only relevant for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024; for calls
with opening date as from 31 July 2024, specific unit costs for each OCT apply).
90EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, bear in mind that a new and extended list of
countries has been published in Annex 2a, and that this list contains a number of countries that
were not included in the list for previous calls.
Moreover, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is a specific unit cost for
’other countries’ that are not specifically mentioned in the list. Therefore, in practice there is now
a relevant unit cost to reimburse accommodation costs for any country in the world.
Regarding subsistence:
The formula for calculating the subsistence is:
{amount per unit [depending on country]}
multiplied by
{days spent on travel}
Subsistence unit costs are for a 24-hour period. The amount of unit costs to be declared
should be calculated by rounding up or down to the nearest full number of days, except for
the first day where any amount of hours will be rounded up to 1 full day.
For the EU’s outermost regions or OCTs, the rate for the relevant Member State can be used
as a proxy amount (— only relevant for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024; for calls
with opening date as from 31 July 2024, specific unit costs for each OCT apply).
The subsistence unit costs is intended to cover meals and other incidental expenses.
However, it is not necessary to verify whether the person already received a meal free of cost
(for example, a meal provided by the meeting/conference organiser or breakfast included in
the associated hotel amount; this does not impact the amount paid for the subsistence unit
cost).
For calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, bear in mind that a new and extended list of
countries has been published in Annex 2a, and that this list contains a number of countries that
were not included in the list for previous calls.
Moreover, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is a specific unit cost for
’other countries’ that are not specifically mentioned in the list. Therefore, in practice there is now
a relevant unit cost to reimburse subsistence costs for any country in the world.
Record-keeping — As regards record-keeping, the beneficiaries will have to be able to
prove (upon request) that an instance of travel took place and was linked to the action. The
beneficiaries do not need to keep specific records on the actual costs incurred, but must keep
adequate records and supporting documents to prove the number of units declared (see Article
20).
Example: Documents with a dated attendance list and description of the meeting can demonstrate that the
travel took place, was necessary for the action and occurred during the action duration. To be able to identify
the unit cost of each travel, the beneficiary could indicate on the attendance list the place of departure of the
persons for whom travel costs are claimed. In case of an event with no attendance list (a smaller/informal
meeting or event organised by a third party), the beneficiary must keep evidence to demonstrate that the
person travelled and that it was linked to the action: the agenda, email invitation, the minutes or report of
the event, the boarding pass, travel ticket, etc.
Specific cases (Travel and subsistence (C.1)):
Travel and subsistence for persons other than personnel (e.g. conference speakers,
visiting experts) (actual or unit cost) — Travel and subsistence costs may also be eligible
for persons that participate in the action on an ad-hoc basis (e.g. attending specific
91EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
meetings), if this complies with the general and specific eligibility conditions in Article 6.1 and
6.2.C, in particular being necessary for the implementation of the action, and:
− their participation is foreseen in Annex 1, or
− their participation is specifically justified in the periodic technical report and approved
by the granting authority (simplified approval procedure).
In line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel, the beneficiary may purchase itself or
reimburse these persons.
Carbon-offsetting (actual cost only) — Costs associated with carbon offsetting measures
can be eligible if they are in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel (not just for
the EU action) and fulfil the general and specific cost eligibility conditions (e.g. incurred
during the action duration, in connection with the action as described in Annex 1 and the
underlying travel is necessary for the action’s implementation).
Air travel below 400 km (unit cost only) — Air travel below 400km is in principle not
reimbursed (participants are expected to use land travel for such distances and can charge
such land travel costs).
However, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is some flexibility to
reimburse air travel below 400km on the basis of actual costs incurred where land travel
would be not possible or appropriate. This may, for instance, be the case:
- where land travel is not available for a particular route (for example, travel from an
island to another island or from an island to the mainland)
- where land travel would involve an unusually long length of time (for example, an
anticipated journey time of seven hours or more (‘door to door’) for a one-way trip of
less than 399 km if there is a direct route by air travel as an alternative)
- where land travel is normally available but, due to unforeseen events, not available at
the time (for example, works on a train line meaning the train connection is cancelled;
proof of such circumstances should be kept on file).
Best practice: Beneficiaries who have queries in specific cases should contact the granting
authority (ideally before the travel is undertaken, but at the very latest before the costs are
submitted at the end of a reporting period). Costs for air travel for distances below 400 km
which have not been agreed with the granting authority may be rejected or adjusted to the
equivalent costs for land travel.
Travel by car (unit cost only) — Car travel below 50 km is NEVER eligible for
reimbursement using unit costs. However, it could be reimbursed using costs actually
incurred, where this is in line with the usual practices of the beneficiary.
For distances between 50 and 399 km, travel by car can be reimbursed as a form of land
travel (i.e. using the applicable ‘land travel’ unit costs).
For travel above 400 km, the situation depends on the call opening date:
− for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: car travel can NOT be reimbursed
using unit costs, but could be reimbursed on the basis of costs actually incurred,
where this is in line with the usual practices of the beneficiary
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: reimbursement of car travel above
400km using unit costs is possible where the travel took place in one of the land travel
connections for land travel between 50 and 399 km covered by authorising decision
C(2021)35; if there is no such land travel connection, then costs can be reimbursed
using costs actually incurred, where in line with and allowed by the beneficiaries usual
practices.
92EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
No matter the actual distance travelled, the reimbursement is limited to the unit cost for
land travel between 50 and 399 km.
Example: For example, a person drives from Frankfurt in Germany to Bern in Switzerland – a distance
of 420 km. Since there are unit costs for distances of 50 – 399 km for land travel between Germany and
Switzerland, this travel can be reimbursed with a unit cost amount of EUR 66. If the connection by car is
not covered by authorising decision C(2021)35, then costs can be reimbursed using costs actually
incurred, where in line with and allowed by the beneficiaries usual practices.
Destinations with different distances in the flight- and land travel calculators (e.g.
the flight calculator shows a distance below 400 km but the land travel calculator shows a
distance of more than 400km) (unit cost only) — In the unit cost system, reimbursement of
air travel is only possible where the travel is more than 400km, as calculated by the flight
calculator. Therefore, if the flight calculator shows a distance of 390 km, the travel costs can
NOT be reimbursed using the air travel unit costs.
Instead, the amounts to be claimed for this travel should be calculated according to the rules
for land travel. Thus, if for instance the land travel calculator shows a distance of 440 km, the
travel must be reimbursed using the relevant rules for land-based travel, i.e.:
− for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: using the unit costs set out in Annex
2a for air, rail or combined air/rail (see table ’for travel of 400 km or more (air or rail
or combined air/rail)’)
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: using unit costs if there is a
corresponding unit cost for that travel (for example, land travel of 400 – 600 km
within France, or between Belgium and France, or between Germany and
Switzerland); if there is no applicable unit cost for that travel, then it can be
reimbursed on the basis of costs actually incurred.

1. Equipment costs (depreciation costs) (C.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility
conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the depreciation option (default option
for most programmes), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Equipment costs’ as
depreciation costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘depreciation only’ (NOT ‘depreciation
and full cost for listed equipment’ or ‘full cost and depreciation for listed equipment’; see
Data Sheet, Point 3). For those other options, see specific cases below.
In this case, this budget category covers the depreciation costs of equipment, infrastructure
or other assets used for the action. In addition, in some cases (e.g. infrastructure), it may
also include the costs necessary to ensure that the asset is ready for its intended use (e.g.
site preparation, delivery and handling, installation, etc).
What not? If the beneficiary’s usual practice is to consider durable equipment costs (or
some of them) as indirect costs, these can NOT be declared as direct costs, but are covered
by the flat rate for indirect costs (see Article 6.2.E). Any depreciation declared as a direct
cost under the action must be a direct cost under the beneficiary’s cost accounting practices
(see Article 6.2).
1.2 The costs must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.2, in
particular:
97EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts,
etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C and
− be written off in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual accounting practices and with
international accounting standards.
‘International accounting standards’ are an internationally recognised set of rules for
maintaining books and reporting company accounts, designed to be compared and
understood across countries.
Example: The IAS 16 (International Accounting Standards) or the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), originally created by the EU and now in common international use.
1.4 They must be calculated according to the following principles:
− the depreciable amount (purchase price) of the equipment must be allocated on a
systematic basis over its useful life (i.e. the period during which the equipment is
expected to be usable). If the equipment’s useful life is more than a year, the
beneficiary can NOT charge the total cost of the item in a single year
‘Useful life’ means the time during which the equipment is useful for the beneficiary. If
the beneficiary does not normally calculate depreciation, it may refer to its national
tax regulations to define the useful life of the equipment.
Declaring the full price in one single year would be considered either as not compliant
with the international accounting standards or as an excessive cost — and therefore in
both cases ineligible; see specific case ‘cash-based accounting’ below), except in case of
low-value assets (see below).
− depreciated equipment costs can NOT exceed the equipment’s purchase price
− if the beneficiary does not use the equipment exclusively for the action, only the
portion used on the action may be charged (the amount of use must be auditable)
Example:
A large 3D printer was bought before the action started and was not fully depreciated. For 6
months in reporting period 1 it was used for the action for 50 % of the time and for other
activities for the other 50 % of the time. Linear depreciation is applied according to the
beneficiary’s usual practices (depreciation over the expected period of use of the 3D printer):
EUR 100 000 per year (EUR 50 000 for 6 months).
Costs declared for the project: EUR 50 000 (6 months of use) multiplied by 50 % of use for the
action during those 6 months = EUR 25 000.
− the beneficiary can charge depreciation in line with applicable audit standards and its
usual accounting practices, i.e. normally at the earliest for periods as of the reception
of the equipment and its availability for use (i.e. when it is in the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management).
Example: A robot-supported equipment was bought on 15 November and received and set up
for use as of 01 December. The reporting period ends on 31 December and the financial year
also ends on 31 December. The maximum depreciation that the beneficiary may charge is 1
month (from 1 to 31 December); i.e. 1/12 of the annual depreciation. This applies even if the
beneficiary recorded in its accounts at 31 December a full year of depreciation for the item.
The depreciation costs must be calculated for each reporting period.
2. Equipment costs (full cost) (C.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
98EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the full cost option (sometimes in HE,
RFCS, DEP, EDF, SMP, EU4H, EUAF, UCPM, RELEX; always in CEF, CCEI, HUMA), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Equipment costs’ as full costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘full cost only’ (NOT ‘depreciation and
full cost for listed equipment’ or ‘full cost and depreciation for listed equipment’; see Data
Sheet, Point 3). For those other options, see specific cases below.
Equipment that does not comply with the specific conditions for full cost (e.g. equipment
purchased prior to the action but used for the action) must be declared using the normal
depreciation cost.
In this case, the equipment costs cover the full capitalised costs for the equipment,
infrastructure or other assets to the grant.
‘Capitalised’ costs means recorded as assets in the beneficiary’s balance sheet. They may
relate to:
− the full purchase costs and/or
− the full development costs
and must be recorded under a fixed asset account in the beneficiary’s accounting records in
compliance with international accounting standards and the beneficiary’s usual cost
accounting practices.
2.2 The costs must be declared as actual costs.
2.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.2, in
particular:
− for full purchase costs:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts,
etc; see Article 6.1(a)) and
− have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C
Example: A beneficiary needs to buy an off-the-shelf equipment to perform some of its action
tasks. The related purchase costs are eligible if they comply with Article 6.2.C (i.e. ‘best value
for money/or lowest price’ and ‘no conflict of interests’ principles).
− for full development costs:
− depending on the nature of the cost items included in the development cost, fulfil the
general and specific cost eligibility conditions that would apply to the individual cost
item (for example, have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C or fulfil the
specific conditions for personnel costs to be eligible Article 6.2.A).
Example:
A beneficiary is developing a prototype as part of its action tasks. For this purpose, it needs to
buy several components and rely on a service provider to assemble some specific parts of the
prototype. In that case, the related purchase costs are eligible if they comply with Article 6.2.C
(i.e. notably with the ‘best value for money/ or lowest price’ and ‘no conflict of interests’
principles).
The beneficiary has also its own employees involved in the assembling of the other parts of the
prototype. In that case, the related personnel costs are eligible if they comply with Article
6.2.A.1 (personnel costs for employees or equivalent appointing act).
2.4 They must be calculated according to the following principles:
99EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− correspond to the actual costs incurred in the purchase or for the development and
− ensure that there is no double charging of costs (in particular, no charging of
depreciation costs for the prototype or pilot plant to the grant or another EU grant).
They cover the full purchase/development costs (not only the depreciation costs for the
reporting period).
Specific cases (equipment costs (C.2)):
Depreciation and full costs for listed items (option in HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, SMP,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI, PERI, UCPM, RELEX) — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement,
the beneficiaries can use depreciation for all items, except certain items listed in the Grant
Agreement for which you can charge full cost. For details, see above.
Full costs and depreciation for listed items (option in HE, RFCS, EDF, LIFE, SMP, UCPM)
— If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries may charge all items at
full cost, except the ones listed in the Grant Agreement for which you need to use
depreciation. For details, see above.
Full price of a low-value asset in one single year (depreciation) — If the option for
depreciation is activated, full cost of a low-value asset may exceptionally be eligible in the
year when it is purchased if:
− the full cost is recorded in the accounts of the entity in accordance with its usual
accounting practices as expenditure of that year (i.e. NOT recorded as an asset
subject to depreciation)
− the cost of the asset is below the low-value ceiling as defined under national law (e.g.
national tax legislation) or other objective reference compatible with the materiality
principle
and
− the item is used exclusively for the action in the year of purchase.
If the item is not used exclusively for the action in the year of purchase, only the portion
used on the action may be charged.
Equipment bought before the action starting date (depreciation) — If the option for
depreciation is activated, depreciation costs for equipment used for the action, but bought
before the action starting date are eligible if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions of
Article 6.1(a). The remaining depreciation costs (the equipment has not been fully
depreciated before the action’s start) may be eligible for the portion corresponding to the
action duration and to the rate of actual use for the purposes of the action.
Example: According to the beneficiary’s accounting practices, a piece of equipment bought in
January 2020 has a depreciation period of 48 months. If the action starts in January 2022 (when
24 months of depreciation have already passed) and the equipment is used for this action, the
beneficiary can declare the depreciation costs incurred for the remaining 24 months, in proportion
to the equipment’s use for the action.
Cash-based accounting — There are NO exceptions for cash-based accounting. If the
option for depreciation is activated, also beneficiaries with cash-based accounting may only
charge the annual depreciation costs that correspond to the part of the equipment’s use for
the action.They can NOT charge the full price in one single year — even if their usual
accounting practice is to record the equipment’s total purchase costs as an expense in one
year.
Example:
A beneficiary that uses cash-based accounting buys a machine for EUR 100 000 in March 2021.
According to the logbook of the machine, it is used for the action 50 % of the time from 1 July 2021
100EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
until the end of the action. The action started in January 2021 and runs for three years with two
reporting periods. The machine’s useful life is six years.
In the reporting period ending in June 2022, the beneficiary must declare depreciation costs taking
into account the percentage of use, the time used for the action and the machine’s useful life:
EUR 100 000 x (12/72 months) x 50 % (used for the action) = amount declared for the machine
in the first reporting period
In the reporting period ending in December 2023, the beneficiary must declare:
EUR 100 000 x (18/72 months) x 50 % (used for the action) = amount declared for the machine
in the second reporting period
Costs of renting or leasing of equipment, infrastructure or other assets
(depreciation and full cost) — If the equipment was not purchased but rented or leased,
the beneficiaries can charge the renting or leasing costs (i.e. finance leasing, renting and
operational leasing) — both if the option for depreciation or the full cost option are activated,
The costs must comply with the general and specific eligibility conditions (see Article 6.1(a)
and Article 6.2.C). The costs must be calculated according to the following principles :
− they must correspond to the actual eligible costs incurred for the renting or leasing
− they must not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment, infrastructure or
assets
− they must not include any financing fees (e.g. finance charges included in the finance
lease payments or interests on loans taken to finance the purchase)
− there must be no double charging of costs (e.g. no charging of depreciation costs for
equipment previously funded at full cost by an EU grant)
− where the Grant Agreement provides for depreciation: if equipment is not used
exclusively for the action, only the portion used on the action may be charged (the
amount of use must be auditable)
− where the Grant Agreement provides for full cost: in principle the full rental or lease
cost can be charged, irrespective of the portion used on the action. However, the cost
still cannot exceed depreciation costs of similar equipment/infrastructure/assets that
need to be determined based on the duration of the action (i.e. if you enter into a 5-
year lease at the start of a 3-year action, you may only charge cost up to the amount
of depreciation for three years).

C.3 Other goods, works and services
[OPTION 1 for programmes without costs for other goods, works and services (ineligible):
Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with costs for other goods, works and services (standard):
Purchases of other goods, works and services must be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred.
Such goods, works and services include, for instance, consumables and supplies, promotion, dissemination,
protection of results, translations, publications, certificates and financial guarantees, if required under the
Agreement. ]
1. Costs of other goods, works and services (C.3): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge other purchases as ‘Other goods, works and
services’.
This budget category covers the costs for goods and services that were purchased for the
action, such as:
− costs for consumables and supplies (e.g. raw materials, office supplies)
− communication and dissemination costs (e.g. translation and printing costs or graphic
designer fees for printed products such as leaflets or other promotional items in
relation to communication activities; conference fees; costs for speakers and
interpreters)
− costs related to intellectual property rights (IPR) (e.g. costs related to protecting the
results such as consulting fees or fees paid to patent offices)
− costs for certificates on financial statements (CFS) and certificates on methodology
(CoMUC; where necessary)
− costs for financial guarantees (only if required by the granting authority; see Data
Sheet, Point 4.2).
Best practice: If there is any doubt about whether a cost is eligible, or whether a cost is to be
considered a purchase cost for other goods, works and services, the beneficiaries should
contact the granting authority.
What not? If it is the beneficiary’s usual accounting practice to consider some of these costs
(or all of them) as indirect costs, they cannot be declared as direct costs.
1.2 Costs of other goods, works and services must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.3, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a)) and
102EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− be purchased specifically for the action and in accordance with Article 6.2.C.
1.4. Regarding the calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible costs actually
incurred (i.e. the amount paid by the beneficiary for the supply of the goods, works or
services).
Specific cases (costs for other goods, works and services (D.3)):
Supplies in stock — Supplies and consumables which were already in the stock of the
beneficiary may be eligible as a direct cost, if they are used for the action and fit the
definition of direct costs under Article 6.2.
Self-produced consumables with an accounting value in the inventory of the
beneficiary (i.e. not internally invoiced costs for goods and services) — Consumables that
are manufactured (produced) by the beneficiary itself do not have a purchase price; the cost
of production for the beneficiary is however normally recorded in the accounts of the
beneficiary (as part of the inventory). Therefore, the eligible costs of self-produced
consumables must be determined on the basis of its accounting value under the following
conditions:
− only the direct costs within the accounting value of the consumable (cost of
production) may be charged
and
− the amount resulting from the indent above may not be significantly higher than the
market price of the consumable.
Beneficiaries can NOT charge the commercial price of their self-produced consumables,
since it is not allowed to include a profit.
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — Costs for staff provided by a temporary
work agency are eligible normally under category C.3 Other goods and services if they
comply with the eligibility conditions (and unless the temporary work agency carries out
directly some task of the action, in which case it can be considered as subcontracting and
should be declared under category B. Subcontracting).
Communication and dissemination plans — The eligibility of costs for communication and
dissemination plans (e.g. HE plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results) depends
on their timing. Costs for the drawing up of plans that must be submitted together with the
proposal are normally NOT eligible since they will have been incurred before the start of the
action, to prepare the proposal. Costs for plans that are required only later or that occur
when revising or implementing the plan may be eligible if the eligibility conditions are
fulfilled.
Protection of results — Costs related to the protection of the action’s results may be
eligible if the eligibility conditions are fulfilled. However, costs related to protection of other
intellectual property (e.g. background patents) are NOT eligible.
IPR access rights (HE) — Royalties paid for IPR access rights (and by extension any lump
sum payments) may be eligible costs provided that all the eligibility conditions are fulfilled
(e.g. necessary for the implementation of the action, incurred during the action, reasonable,
etc).
The following are however NOT eligible (or eligible only within certain limits):
− royalties for an exclusive licence: are eligible only if it can be shown that the
exclusivity (and thus the higher royalties) is absolutely necessary for the
implementation of the action
103EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− royalties for licensing agreements which were already in force before the start of the
action: only the part of the licence fee that can be linked to the action is eligible (since
the licence presumably goes beyond the action implementation)
− royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries for
implementing the action: since the default rule is that access rights are granted on a
royalty-free basis and beneficiaries may deviate only if agreed before grant signature,
royalties may be eligible only if explicitly agreed by all beneficiaries before grant
signature
Best practice: If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is
recommended that this is explained in detail in their proposal.
− royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries for exploiting
the results and by extension royalties paid to third parties for exploitation of the
results: are NOT eligible.
Costs related to research output management (HE) — Costs for research output
management (e.g. management of research data) are eligible if the eligibility conditions are
fulfilled, including open access to peer-reviewed publications (but see the additional eligibility
condition referenced immediately below), research data and other outputs.
Open access to scientific publications (HE) — In addition to fulfilling the other costs

CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM; see Article 6.2.D.1 FSTP)
− Internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF; see Article 6.2.D.2 Internally
invoiced goods and services)
− HE Access to research infrastructure costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_RI)
− HE PCP/PPI procurement costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_PCP/PPI)
− HE ERC additional funding (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_ERC_Additional funding)
− CEF Studies (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Studies)
− CEF Synergetic elements (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Synergetic elements)
− CEF Works in outermost regions (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Works in outermost regions)
− CEF Land purchase ( see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Land purchase)
− LIFE Land purchase (see Article 6.2.D.X LIFE_Land purchase)
− AMIF EMN ad hoc queries (see Article 6.2.D.X AMIF_EMN ad hoc queries)
1.2 Depending on the provisions of the specific cost categories, they must be declared as
actual costs (or any other cost type, e.g. unit cost, flat rate or lump sum).
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in each specific cost
category.
1.4 The calculation method will depend on the type of cost and the provisions of each
specific cost category.
105EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 6.2.D.1 > Financial support to third parties
D.1 Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (all programmes except RFCS,SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM)
D.1 Financial support to third parties
Costs for providing financial support to third parties (in the form of grants, prizes or similar forms of
support; if any) are eligible, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions, are calculated [on the basis of the costs actually incurred][as unit costs in accordance
with the method set out in Annex 2a] and the support is implemented in accordance with the conditions set
out in Annex 1.
These conditions must ensure objective and transparent selection procedures and include at least the
following:
(a) for grants (or similar):
(i) the maximum amount of financial support for each third party (‘recipient’); this amount
may not exceed the amount set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 3)30 or otherwise agreed
with the granting authority
(ii) the criteria for calculating the exact amount of the financial support
(iii) the different types of activity that qualify for financial support, on the basis of a closed list
(iv) the persons or categories of persons that will be supported and
(v) the criteria and procedures for giving financial support
(b) for prizes (or similar):
(i) the eligibility and award criteria
(ii) the amount of the prize and
(iii) the payment arrangements.
[This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate.]]
30 The amount must be specified in the call. It may not be more than 60 000 EUR, unless the objective of the action would otherwise be
impossible or overly difficult or in the case of humanitarian aid, emergency support operations, civil protection operations, or crisis
management aid (Article 207 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
1. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except RFCS, SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM) AND provided for in the call conditions, the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs under ‘Financial support to third parties
(FSTP)’, where giving such support is part of the action activities.
This budget category covers ‘cascading’ grants, prizes or similar (meaning where the
beneficiaries of the EU grant cascade down (part of) the financial contribution to third parties,
so-called ‘recipients’).
For some programmes, the specific cost category in Article 6 is complemented by specific
rules in Annex 5 for carrying out the action within the meaning of Article 18 (see Annex 5 >
HE Co-funded Partnerships).
106EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Financial support to third parties may be given to natural persons (e.g. allowance,
scholarship, fellowship) or legal persons (e.g. non-repayable financial assistance to local
NGOs), seed money to start-ups or microcredit, or other forms. Also prizes can be given on
the basis of a contest organised by the beneficiary.
Examples:
1. An action in the area of sustainable agriculture and forestry includes financial support for
end-users (farmers) testing the technology developed within the action.
2. One of the work packages in Annex 1 includes funding for awarding three scholarships in the field
of the action.
3. A prize announced at the beginning of the action for identifying a (new) approach to dealing with
a technical implementation problem to be tackled at the end of the action.
4. A grant is given to a beneficiary foreseeing that the beneficiary should fund local NGOs which in
turn provide food vouchers and microcredits to natural persons in third countries.
The financial support scheme itself is NOT an EU action; the beneficiaries are providing the
financial support in their own name and under their own responsibility. When promoting the
EU action (see Article 17), the financial support must therefore NOT be presented as directly
provided by the EU.
What not? Support in kind (e.g. transfer of material for free) by the beneficiary to a third
party is NOT considered financial support.
This cost category can only cover financial support. By contrast, cost for non-financial
support or support given in-kind (e.g. vouchers) must be declared under other categories (e.g. as
cost for purchases of vouchers).
The recipients are NOT party to the Grant Agreement and therefore do NOT need to be listed
nor be registered in the Participant Register.
1.2 Costs of financial support to third parties must normally be declared as actual costs (or,
very exceptionally, as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a —
currently only for SMP COSME EYE and ERDF-TA IVY).
1.3 The actual costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.1,
in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− respect the maximum amount of financial support to third parties as set out in the
description of the action (DoA; Annex 1) — normally up to EUR 60 000 per recipient,
but higher amounts are possible if necessary for the objectives of the action and
agreed with the granting authority (in the call conditions/Grant Agreement)
Systematic exceptions are foreseen for specific types of funding, such as humanitarian
aid, emergency support operations, civil protection operations, or crisis management aid
(see Article 207 FR 2024/2509).
and
− comply with the other conditions for the support that are set out in Annex 1, and in
particular:
− for cascading grants (or similar):
− the maximum amount per third party
107EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the criteria for determining the exact amount of financial support (e.g. EUR
2 000 per hectare; EUR 30 000 per student for a two-year scholarship)
Unless otherwise specified in the Grant Agreement, the financial support
provided by the beneficiaries may take any form (e.g. a lump sum or the
reimbursement of the costs incurred by the recipients when implementing the
supported activities); for the purposes of the EU grant, these remain however
actual costs.
− a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial
support for third parties (e.g. financial support for third parties allowed for
technology-testing activities)
These activities should benefit, primarily, the recipients (NOT the
beneficiaries).
− the persons or category(ies) of persons that may receive it (e.g. farmers; PhD
students, SMEs)
The procedures for selecting the recipients should be described in Annex 1.
− the criteria for giving financial support (e.g. physical characteristics of the
agricultural plots which make them suitable for the purpose of the action).
These criteria should respond to the objectives set out in the call conditions.
− for prizes:
− the amount of the prize (e.g. EUR 10 000)
− a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial
support to third parties and the award criteria for assessing the quality of
entries in light of the objectives and expected results
− the conditions for participation and the conditions for cancellation of the
contest, if any (e.g. eligibility and exclusion criteria; deadline for submission of
entries; possibility of jury interview)
The criteria must be objective.
− the payment arrangements (usually one payment).
− for other forms of financial support to third parties, at least:
− the maximum amount per recipient
− the criteria for determining the exact amount
− the types of activities to be funded
− the types of recipients eligible.
These conditions must also already be part of the proposal.
108EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The FSTP conditions (type of activities, eligible countries, etc) may have to follow similar
principles as those that apply to the beneficiaries themselves under the EU grant, if this is
provided in the call conditions (of the EU grant). These conditions must then also be specified in
the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1). Unless otherwise provided for in the call conditions,
financial support to third parties needs to be given directly from the EU grant beneficiary to the
(final) recipients, without further intermediaries.
The specific cost category in Article 6 is, for some programmes (HE, DEP, HUMA etc),
complemented by specific rules in Annex 5 for carrying out the action within the meaning of
Article 18.
1.4. Regarding the actual cost calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible costs
actually incurred (i.e. the amounts paid by the beneficiary for the cascading grants, prizes or
similar to the third parties during the duration of the action).
Specific cases (FSTP (D.1)):
(Micro)Loans and other financial instruments — If a call allows financial support to third
parties, directly or via implementing partners, in repayable form such as (micro)loans or
other financial instruments with a long-term character that exceed by their nature the
duration of the action and the EU Grant Agreement, Annex 1 must provide for specific
conditions on cost eligibility and acceptance.
For general guidance on financial support to third parties, see Guidance on good practices for
implementing FSTP in EU grants.
109EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 6.2.D.2 > Internally invoiced goods and services
D.2 Internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF)
D.2 Internally invoiced goods and services
Costs for internally invoiced goods and services directly used for the action may be declared as unit cost
according to usual cost accounting practices, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions for such unit costs and the amount per unit is calculated:
(a) using the actual costs for the good or service recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts, attributed either
by direct measurement or on the basis of cost drivers, and excluding any cost which are ineligible or
already included in other budget categories; the actual costs may be adjusted on the basis of
budgeted or estimated elements, if they are relevant for calculating the costs, reasonable and
correspond to objective and verifiable information
and
(b) according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner, based on
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
‘Internally invoiced goods and services’ means goods or services which are provided within the beneficiary’s
organisation directly for the action and which the beneficiary values on the basis of its usual cost accounting
practices.
[This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate.]
1. Internally invoiced goods and services (D.2): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (HE, DEP and EDF), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs under ‘Internally invoiced goods and
services’.
This budget category covers the costs for goods and services that the beneficiary itself
produced or provided for the action. They may include (non-exhaustive list):
− self-produced consumables (e.g. electronic wafers, chemicals)
− use of specific devices or facilities needed for the action (e.g. clean room, wind tunnel,
supercomputer facilities, electronic microscope, animal house, greenhouse, aquarium)
− standardised testing or research and development processes (e.g. genomic test, mass
spectrometry analysis)
− hosting services for visiting project team members participating in the action (e.g.
housing, canteen).
What not? Costs of goods or services purchased and costs of goods or services internally
invoiced which are not directly used for the action (e.g. supporting services like cleaning,
general accountancy, administrative support, etc).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs in accordance with usual cost accounting
practices. The usual cost accounting practices must define both the unit (e.g. hour of use of
wind tunnel, one genomic test, one electronic wafer fabricated internally, etc) and the
methodology to determine the cost of the unit.
It is NOT necessary to have a document called ‘internal invoice’ to support these costs, but
the beneficiary should have a documented methodology how to determine them (such a
110EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
methodology must be part of its usual costs accounting practices). The beneficiary must also
keep supporting evidence of the use of the good or service for the action and showing the
number of units used.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.2, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary for the action, identifiable and verifiable, etc; see Article
6.1(b))
− be in line with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices and
− the cost accounting practices must have been applied in a consistent manner, based
on objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
It must be the usual practice of the beneficiary to calculate a unit cost for that good or
service. The unit costs is the internal cost per unit that is charged between departments of
the same entity; it is not the price charged in the context of commercial sales or to grants
from other fund providers.
The beneficiary must consistently apply its usual cost accounting practices to calculate the
unit cost, based on objective criteria that must be verifiable if there is a check, audit, review
or investigation. You must do this no matter who is funding the action.
Example (ineligible): If you set up a new unit cost which applies only to EU actions, the
internally invoiced costs based on that new unit cost would be ineligible as they would not be your
usual cost accounting practice.
Example (eligible): If you make adjustments to comply with the Grant Agreement because the
usual methodology includes an ineligible cost item, the adjusted methodology will still be
considered as your usual cost accounting practice and not as a new unit cost.
1.4 The costs must be calculated using the actual costs recorded in the beneficiary’s
accounts, excluding any ineligible costs or costs already included in other budget categories:
− if necessary, the unit cost must be adjusted to remove:
− cost elements that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (even if they are
part of the beneficiary’s usual methodology for determining the unit cost for its
internal invoices)
Example: The beneficiary uses internal invoices for the use of an electronic microscope
based on a unit cost per hour of use. The methodology to calculate the unit cost
includes costs of capital (e.g. interest charged by the bank for a loan used to buy the
microscope). Those costs are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (see Article 6.3) and
must therefore be removed. The unit cost must be recalculated without them.
You can NOT simply apply an estimated percentage of deduction on the amount
of your internal invoices to remove ineligible costs. You have to ensure that the
internal invoice does not include any ineligible costs.
− costs of resources that do not belong to the beneficiary and which it uses free
of charge (e.g. personnel or equipment of a third party provided free of
charge), because those costs are not in its accounts (see Article 6.1(a)(v))
− costs that are already included in other budget categories (double funding of
the same costs, see Article 6.1(a)(i))
Example: The beneficiary uses internal invoices for water chemistry analyses, based on
a unit cost per water sample analysed. The methodology to calculate the unit cost
includes the cost of the staff carrying out the analysis. However, the costs for those
111EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
persons are already charged to the action under direct personnel costs (category A.1).
The cost of the staff must therefore be removed and the unit cost must be recalculated
without them.
− if budgeted or estimated elements were included in the calculation of the amount per
unit, those elements must:
− be relevant (i.e. clearly related to invoiced item)
− be used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not play major role in calculating the unit
cost)
− correspond to objective and verifiable information (i.e. their basis is clearly
defined and the beneficiary can show how they were calculated)
− only the share of the actual costs that are used for the production of the internally
invoiced good or service may be included in the pool of costs used to determine the
cost per unit; the share of these costs must be calculated by direct measurement
(‘direct costs’). The pool must not include any indirect costs (except for in HE, see
specific cases below), in particular not general administrative costs
Allocation keys resulting in a higher unit cost for the internally invoiced good or
service when used in EU grants compared with other projects will NOT be accepted.
Impact on horizontal 215-days ceiling — The share of the cost of a cost item
included in the internal invoice reduces the share of the cost item that can be charged as
direct costs to EU actions. For example, the share of the working time of a person that is
included in the calculation of the unit cost reduces the number of day-equivalents that the
person can charge over the year to EU grants (see Article 6.2.A).
Double funding risk — The same time of the person can NOT be charged twice to the
grant, i.e. it can NOT be once embedded in the unit cost and again as direct personnel
costs.
Example (costs for use of an animal housing facility):
Generally eligible as part of the unit cost:
– staff working for the facility (e.g. keepers, veterinarians and other persons directly
assigned to run the animal house)
– consumables used for the animal housing (e.g. animal food, bedding)
– depreciation of cages and other equipment directly used to the housing of the animals
– generic supplies like electricity or water used in the facility
– specific maintenance and cleaning of the animal house facility
– costs of shared infrastructures where the animal housing is located (e.g. central heating,
air-conditioning system) and their shared maintenance costs, allocated via usual key
driver
– shared services with allocation of the costs incurred for the animal house facility via usual
key driver (e.g. shared cleaning services of the building where the animal housing is
located)
– depreciation costs of shared buildings allocated via usual key driver (e.g. if the animal
housing is part of a main building of the beneficiary)
Generally ineligible as part of the unit cost:
– bank interests
– provisions for future expenses
– cost declared under other cost categories (e.g. personnel cost, equipment depreciation
cost) and indirect cost (e.g. facility management costs allocated on the basis of the
square meters the shelter occupies, general administrative costs such as those
stemming from the HR, legal or accounting departments)
– any other ineligible costs (see Article 6.3)
112EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example (costs for use of a wind tunnel facility):
Generally eligible as part of the unit cost:
– staff working for the facility (e.g. technicians, engineers and other persons directly
assigned to the functioning of the wind tunnel)
– depreciation of the equipment, including specific software and hardware necessary for the
functioning of the wind tunnel
– generic supplies like electricity used for the wind tunnel
– insurance of the wind tunnel (or the premises in which it is located)
– specific maintenance and cleaning of the wind tunnel equipment (e.g. air cooling system)
– calibration/metrology tests of the wind tunnel
– costs of shared infrastructures where the wind tunnel is located, allocated via usual key
driver (e.g. central heating, air-conditioning system) and their related shared
maintenance costs
– depreciation costs of shared buildings allocated via usual key driver (e.g. if the building
where the wind tunnel is located is part of a main building of the beneficiary)
Generally ineligible as part of the unit cost:
– bank interests
– provisions for future expenses
– cost declared under other cost categories (e.g. personnel cost, equipment depreciation
cost) and indirect cost (e.g. power supply costs allocated to a clean room on the basis of
the square meters it occupies, general administrative costs such as those stemming from
the HR, legal or accounting departments)
– any other ineligible costs (see Article 6.3)
Double funding risk — The same time of the person can NOT be charged twice to the grant,
i.e. it can NOT be once embedded in the unit cost and again as direct personnel costs.
Specific cases (costs of internally invoiced goods and services (D.2)):
Actual direct and indirect costs (HE) — If part of the usual cost accounting practices,
beneficiaries may calculate the share of the actual costs that are used for the production of
the internally invoiced good or service either by direct measurement (‘direct costs’; see
above) or by using the allocation keys defined in the costs accounting practices (‘indirect
costs’) (e.g. power supply costs allocated to a clean room on the basis of the square meters it
occupies, general administrative costs such as those stemming from the HR, legal or
accounting departments).
Co-owned resources— As an exception, if the resource for which the unit cost is calculated
is co-owned by the beneficiary and a third party, the costs registered in the accounts of the
third party for the co-owned resource do not need to be removed if:
− the third party is mentioned in the grant (e.g. as beneficiary, affiliated entity or, for
HE, third party providing in-kind contributions in Annex 1) and
− the costs fulfil the other eligibility conditions of this Article (e.g. directly linked to the
resource, exclude ineligible costs, etc).

1. HE Transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure unit costs (D.3 and
D.4): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 This cost category will be inserted for the Horizon Europe standard types of action (e.g.
RIA, CSA, COFUND, etc) that involve transnational and/or virtual access to research
infrastructure for scientific communities (‘provision of access activities’), in particular calls
under Part III of the HE Work Programme, ‘Research Infrastructures’.
This cost category is optional. Beneficiaries can declare their access costs either as unit
costs under this cost category OR simply as actual costs under another fitting cost category
(e.g. purchase cost), OR — where duly justified and subject to certain conditions — as a
combination of unit costs and actual costs.
The specific cost category in Article 6 is complemented by specific rules in Annex 5 for
carrying out the action within the meaning of Article 18 (see Annex 5 > HE access for
research infrastructure activities).
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘transnational or virtual
access to research infrastructure unit costs’.
The budget category covers direct and indirect access costs for providing transnational access
to research infrastructure (i.e. the installation’s operating costs and costs related to logistical,
technological and scientific support for users, including ad-hoc user training and the
preparatory and closing activities needed to use the installation).
114EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What not? Travel and subsistence costs for users to get transnational access are not
included in the access costs. These costs can be reimbursed separately, in category C.1
Travel and subsistence; see Article 6.2.C.1.
1.2 If declared under this budget category, the costs must be declared as unit costs, using
the unit cost table (rates per unit of access) agreed with the granting authority (see HE RI
authorising decision16 and Annex 2a and 2b).
The ‘unit of access’ must be identified for each installation (i.e. the unit used to measure the
quantity of access that the installation provides to its users).
The precise unit cost (amount per unit, i.e. EUR/unit of access) is not prefixed by the
authorising decision. It must be calculated for each access provider and installation (you can
use the calculators (calculator HE UN RI TA and calculator HE UN RI VA) provided on the call
page) and then summarised in the table ‘Summary of transnational/virtual access provision’
in the proposal and in the unit cost table in Annex 2b of the Grant Agreement:
Short name Short Installation Unit of Amount Estimated Total unit
access name access per unit No of units cost
provider infrastru No Short name (cost per unit
cture x estimated
no of units)
The summary table in the proposal is generic (must be filled in for all proposals giving access
to research infrastructure, even if they do not use the unit cost). Annex 2b is needed only for
actions that use the unit cost.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (unit of access rate) is:
− for transnational access:
{average annual total access costs to the installation (over past two years)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
average annual total quantity of access to the installation (over past two years)}
− for virtual access:
{total virtual access costs to the installation (over the last year)
_ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
total quantity of virtual access to the installation (over the last year)}
The averages must be based on:
− the beneficiary’s certified or auditable historical data
− costs allocated to the installation according to the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices (including where the installation has been in operation for less than two
years) and
16 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
115EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− a period excluding times when the installation was not usable (out of order, under repair
or undergoing long-term maintenance).
In exceptional and duly justified cases, the granting authority may agree with a beneficiary to
use a different reference period than the ones referred to above (two years for transnational
access and one year for virtual access).
The ‘total quantity of access’ means all the units of access annually provided by the installation,
included access financed under previous EU grants, if any.
The ‘annual total access costs to the installation’ is calculated on the basis of the following
categories of eligible costs:
− the direct costs incurred by the access provider for the ‘annual total quantity of access to
the installation’, as recorded in the certified or auditable profit-and-loss accounts of the
reference period for:
− personnel costs of administrative, technical and scientific staff directly assigned to
the functioning of the installation and to the support of the users
− costs of contracts for maintenance and repair (including specific cleaning, calibrating
and testing) specifically awarded for the functioning of the installation (if not
capitalised)
− costs of consumables specifically used for the installation and the user’s research
work
− costs of contracts for installation management, including security fees, insurance
costs, quality control and certification, upgrading to national and/or EU quality,
safety or security standards (if not capitalised) specifically incurred for the
functioning of the installation
− costs of energy power and water supplied for the installation where it can be verified
as being supplied exclusively for the installation and as being a major cost item for
the installation
− costs of general services when they are specifically included in the provided access
services (e.g. library costs, shipping costs, transport costs)
− costs of software licence, internet connection or other electronic services for data
management and computing when they are needed to provide access services
− costs of specific scientific services included in the access provided or needed for the
provision of access
− the indirect costs for providing access to the installation, equal to 25% of the eligible direct
costs
AND excluding:
− all contributions to the capital investments of the installation (including rental, lease
or depreciation costs of buildings as well as depreciation and lease of
instrumentation); those costs are not eligible unless otherwise specified in the work
programme/call conditions, in which case only the portion used to provide access
under the action can be eligible
− travel and subsistence costs for users
− ineligible costs as referred to in Article 6.3.
Example (amount per unit):
Assuming that a telescope provided 6 100 hours of access in year N-1 and 5 900 hours of
access in year N-2 and that the total access costs (for the provision of these total quantities of
access) in the two years calculated on the basis of the categories of costs indicated above (with
the exclusion of any contribution to capital investment and of travel and subsistence costs of
users) is respectively EUR 3 200 000 and EUR 2 800 000, then the unit cost is

Average hours = average (6 100, 5 900) = 6 000
Unit cost = average (3 200 000, 2 800 000) / average (6 100, 5 900) = 3 000 000 /6 000 =
500 €
116EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The detailed calculations used (one calculator sheet for each installation) must be kept by
beneficiaries as supporting documents in case of audits.
The granting authority may verify that the proposed unit costs comply with the prescribed
calculation method (and correct them, if needed).
The proposal and Annex 1 should describe the access services provided and the logistical,
technological and scientific support given to users (including ad-hoc training and preparatory
and closing activities necessary to use the installation).
As mentioned above, the use of unit costs for transnational and virtual access activities is
optional, i.e. each access provider can decide for each installation whether to be reimbursed
on the basis of unit costs, actual costs or a combination of the two. This decision must be
taken before grant signature and applied consistently throughout the action. In duly justified
cases, for example when there are significant variations in the costs for providing access, it
can be updated through an amendment with the agreement of the granting authority.
Double funding risk — Costs that are declared as a specific unit cost can NOT be declared a
second time under another budget category (for the costs that are covered, see below).
Example: A same cost item (e.g the salary of a member of the research infrastructure staff) cannot be used
for calculating the unit cost and then charged as actual cost under personnel costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.3 and
6.2.D.4, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1 (b))
− be incurred for providing transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure to
scientific communities.
1.4 They must be calculated, for each access provider and installation, , in accordance with
the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure unit
costs is:
{amount per unit [rate per unit of access set out in Annex 2b]}
multiplied by
{number of actual units of access provided}
The unit of access rate is fixed by the granting authority, based on the rates proposed by the
beneficiaries in Annex 2b (see above).

D.5 HE PCP/PPI procurement costs
[OPTION for HE PCP/PPI: D.5 PCP/PPI procurement costs
PCP/PPI procurement costs are eligible, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions, are calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred and:
- are incurred for a joint pre-commercial procurement or joint or coordinated public procurement of
innovative goods and services targeted by the action and described in Annex 1 and
- the procurement is carried out by a ‘contracting authority/entity’ as defined in the EU public
procurement Directives (in particular, Directives 2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU and 2009/81/EC).
The beneficiaries must award the procurement contracts to the tender(s) offering best value for money and
use objective and transparent procedures which — unless otherwise provided in the call conditions —
include:
- if a preliminary market consultation is carried out: the publication of a prior information notice about
the consultation in the Official Journal of the European Union
- the publication of a contract notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
- the publication of a contract award notice within 48 days after concluding the contract(s) in the
Official Journal of the European Union
in English and any additional language(s) chosen by the beneficiaries.
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security reasons, the beneficiaries must
ensure that the performance of the contract takes place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in
the call conditions — unless otherwise approved by the granting authority.
For PPI procurements, beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU
Directives on public procurement must also comply with these Directives and the applicable national law on
public procurement.
The beneficiaries which act as procurers (i.e. the buyers group and the lead procurer), the object and
estimated cost for each procurement and the estimated financial contribution per member of the buyers group
must be set out in Annex 1 and the estimated procurement costs per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2.
The costs for the cost categories other than procurement costs are eligible only up to 50% of the total
estimated eligible costs of the action set out in Annex 2.
This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate. ]

1. HE PCP/PPI procurement costs (D.5): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility
conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for Horizon Europe PCP/PPI actions (i.e. calls
with PCP/PPI ToA).
118EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This cost category is used ONLY for calls that run as PCP/PPI type of action (i.e. where
also the Annex 5 > HE PCP and PPI procurements provisions apply).
For these calls, the rules for subcontracts and subcontractors in Article 6.2.B and
Article 9.3 do NOT apply for the PCP or PPI procurement. Costs must be charged under
Article 6.2.D.5 (new for 2021-2027).
Other types of calls (RIA, IA, CSA, etc) are NOT subject to Article 6.2.D.5 (nor to
Annex 5) —even if projects should include PCP or PPI activities. For them, the PCP/PPI
activities must be handled as subcontracting in accordance with Article 6.2.B and Article
9.3.
However, for BOTH groups, the detailed provisions in General Annex H of the HE Work
Programme apply. If you plan to implement PCP or PPI activities in a Horizon Europe
action, you should therefore always first look at the General Annex.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘PCP/PPI procurement
costs’.
This budget category ‘covers only the costs of the PCP/PPI procurement (i.e. the price of the
PCP/PPI procurement paid to the PCP/PPI providers, including related duties, taxes and
charges, such as non-deductible, non-refundable value added tax (VAT)). Only costs of R&D
services (PCP) or innovative solutions (PPI) procured by the beneficiaries are eligible.
Be aware that different duties, taxes and charges (in particular also a different VAT rate)
may apply depending on the payment set-up for the procurement (centralised or
decentralised payments).
What not? It does not cover the costs for the additional activities related to the PCP/PPI
procurement.
‘Additional activities’ are the activities needed to prepare, manage and follow-up the PCP/PPI
procurement (including testing of solutions by the lead procurer, buyers group, or other end-
users) and further activities to embed the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side activities.
Some of those are a mandatory part of the EU action (e.g. the activities needed to coordinate
and implement the PCP/PPI procurement; see mandatory deliverables defined in General
Annex H of the HE Work Programme); others are optional (e.g. activities to embed the
PCP/PPI procurement into a wider set of demand side activities), unless otherwise specified in
the work programme/call conditions.
Examples (other additional activities): Activities that aim to remove barriers to introducing an
innovative solution on the market (including standardisation, certification and regulation); activities
that prepare the ground for cooperation on future PCP or PPI projects; awareness raising and
experience sharing/training.
Costs for additional activities must always be charged under the fitting standard cost
categories, even when they involve the procurement of (non PCP/PPI) goods or services.
Example (additional activities):
Personnel costs: Costs incurred by the lead procurer, buyers group and other consortium
participants for consulting the market, preparing the call for tender documents etc must be
charged under cost category A.
Subcontracting costs: For web design or publicity campaign to promote the PCP/PPI
procurement, for external experts that support the buyers group in evaluation of tenders must be
charged under cost category B.
Purchase costs: For travel tickets, consumables and equipment that needs to be bought by the
buyers group to test innovative solutions of the providers that win the PCP/PPI contracts must be
charged under cost category C.
119EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Financial support to third parties (FSTP): To award a prize to the solution provider(s) that
performed best in the PCP/PPI procurement must be charged under cost category D.
In-kind contributions (free of charge): Potential end-users of the solutions (e.g. fire brigade)
may make available personnel/equipment to the buyers group (e.g. Ministry of interior) to help test
innovative solutions. For HE PCP/PPI actions, the costs of the personnel/equipment may be
declared as eligible costs by the beneficiaries which use them under the standard cost categories A
and C.2, as if they were their own (see Article 6.1).
Indirect costs for the PCP/PPI procurement costs are also NOT reimbursed.
1.2 PCP/PPI procurement costs must be declared as actual costs (i.e. the price actually
paid).
1.3 The ‘PCP/PPI procurement costs’ must fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article
6.2.D.5, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a))
− be incurred for the PCP/PPI procurement described in Annex 1
− be based on the best value for money
− not be subject to conflict of interest
− awarded following objective and transparent procedures that comply with certain
minimum conditions and
− for PPI: for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’
within the meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24/EU,
2014/25/EU and 2009/81/EC): comply with these Directives and the applicable
national law on public procurement
For PCP/PPI procurements, the contracts may NOT be awarded based on the lowest
price as the only award criterion. In addition to the price, it is mandatory to take into
account also the quality of the proposed innovative solutions in the evaluation of the
tenders.
The minimum procedural conditions explicitly mentioned in Article 6 include obligations to
publish in the OJEU (TED portal) — at least in English (and in any additional languages
chosen by the beneficiaries) — prior information notices (PIN) to announce the open market
consultation and the upcoming PCP/PPI procurement, as well as contract notices and contract
award notices for the PCP/PPI call for tenders.
Regarding deadlines for publication of notices, we will consider as the ‘date of publication’
the date when you submitted the notice to the OJEU Publication Office.
Additional transparency requirements (including timing and exceptions) are set out in Annex
5 > PCP and PPI procurements and General Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
For general guidance on PCP/PPI types of action in HE, see How to set up and manage HE PCP
and PPI grants, HE Programme Guide > Innovation Procurement and General Annexes B and H of
the HE Work Programme.
120EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For PCP procurements, the EU Public Procurement Directives normally do not apply (because
exempted17). However, national laws on public procurement may apply if they have rules for
this type of R&D service contracts. For PPI procurements, both the EU Directives and the
national laws apply.
The beneficiaries which act as procurers (i.e. the buyers group and the lead procurer), the
object and estimated cost for each procurement and the estimated financial contribution per
member of the buyers group must be justified in Annex 1. There is NO simplified approval
procedure).
Finally, there is a cost eligibility ceiling: PCP/PPI procurement costs must amount to a
minimum of 50% of the total estimated costs of the action in the budget table, and all
additional costs can amount to maximum 50% of the costs. This is due to the fact that the
PCP/PPI procurement should be the main objective of PCP/PPI actions.
The maximum amount for additional activities is fixed at Grant Agreement signature, based
on all the estimated eligible costs of the action. The maximum amount of EU funding for
additional activities therefore does NOT change (i.e. will NOT be reduced by the granting
authority) when at the end of the action it turns out that the costs actually incurred for
PCP/PPI procurement are less than initially estimated (e.g. if the buyers group is able to
procure at a better price than it had initially budgeted).
1.4 Regarding the calculation, the amount charged as eligible cost must correspond to the
price invoiced for the PCP/PPI procurement(s).

Specific cases (ERC additional costs (D.7 and D.8)):
Simplified approval procedure (ERC additional costs) — If you need to make some
changes in relation to the additional funding granted, the coordinator must request an
amendment in order to change the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure; for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the
beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting authority might not approve the change
and reject the costs at interim or final payment-stage later on. It is highly recommended to
contact the granting authority before deciding on any change.
Examples (change that could be accepted):
1. The additional funding was awarded to purchase a particular piece of major equipment. During
the implementation of the action, the PI proposes to use the additional funding to acquire a newly
developed equipment that would allow the research team to carry out the action tasks in a more
efficient manner. This change could be accepted.
2. The additional funding was awarded to carry out a sociological experiment in three European
countries. During the implementation of the action, the PI proposes to enlarge the scope of the

incapacity to manage the land according to nature conservation requirements, the property
will be transferred to an entity primarily active in the field of nature protection
(ii) or, if there is no land register or such a condition is not possible under national law, that
such a condition is either included in the land sale contract or guaranteed by equivalent
means
(f) for purchases of partial rights: the entry into the land register duly reflects the long-term nature
conservation objectives and the requirements set out in this Article
(g) for land purchased to be exchanged at a later date for another parcel on which the action will be
undertaken: the exchange is carried out before the end of the action and the land exchanged complies
with the requirements set out in this Article
(h) for long-term leases: the lease is of at least 20 years and includes provisions and commitments that
ensure the achievement of its objectives in terms of habitat and species protection.
This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate.

Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for LIFE Project Grants.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs related to land
purchase separately in this special cost category, if it was set out in the call conditions.
129EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This cost category covers costs for land purchase from private entities (including long-term
lease of land or one-off compensations for land use rights), if incurred under the conditions
and for the purposes set out in the Grant Agreement.
In exceptional cases, also short-term lease of land and temporary compensation may be
eligible if foreseen in the call conditions.
What not? Land purchase from public bodies are not eligible.
Similarly, lease payments or one-off compensation payments to public bodies are not eligible
(— with the exception of duly justified payments to local authorities, i.e. municipalities or
similar, if explicitly allowed by the call conditions). Such payments are subject to a case-by-
case assessment by the granting authority and must be explicitly foreseen in the description
of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement) and it must be demonstrated that it is
the only cost-effective solution to reach the objectives of the action.
Indirect costs for the land purchase costs are also NOT reimbursed.
1.2 They must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 They must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.2 and any
specific call conditions, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− be clearly linked to the objectives of the action, purchased specifically for the action
and in accordance with Article 6.2.D.2, in particular:
− contribute to improving, maintaining and restoring the integrity of the Natura 2000
network
− be the only or the most cost-effective way of achieving the desired conservation
outcome
− be reserved in the long term for uses consistent with the specific objectives of the
LIFE Programme
AND
for purchases:
− the Member State concerned must ensure, by way of transfer or otherwise, the
long-term assignment of the land to nature conservation purposes and the
beneficiary/affiliated entity documents this by ensuring that:
− the entry into the land register includes a condition that the land will be
assigned definitively to nature conservation
or
− if there is no land register or such a condition is not possible under
national law, that such a condition is either included in the land sale
contract or guaranteed by equivalent means.
Where both possibilities exist (sales contract and land registry entry), the
option that offers the strongest long-term protection must be used.
130EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for land purchases by private entities: the beneficiary/affiliated entity must
ensure the long-term conservation by ensuring that:
− the entry into the land register includes a condition that, in case of their
dissolution or incapacity to manage the land according to nature
conservation requirements, the property will be transferred to an entity
primarily active in the field of nature protection
or
− if there is no land register or such a condition is not possible under
national law, that such a condition is either included in the land sale
contract or guaranteed by equivalent means.
Where both possibilities exist (sales contract and land registry entry), the
option that offers the strongest long-term protection must be used. Where
both possibilities exist (sales contract and land registry entry), the option that
offers the strongest long-term protection must be used.
The entity’s statutes must include a provision that, in case of dissolution,
the land will be transferred to another legal body primarily active in the field
of nature conservation (e.g. another conservation NGO or appropriate public
body).
− for purchases of partial rights: the entry into the land register must duly reflect
the long term nature conservation objectives and the requirements set out in
Article 6.2.D.2 of the Grant Agreement
− for land purchased to be exchanged at a later date for another parcel on which
the action will be undertaken: the exchange must be carried out before the end
of the action and the land exchanged must comply with the requirements set
out in Article 6.2.D.2 of the Grant Agreement.
For long-term leases:
− the lease must be of at least 20 years (unless provided otherwise in the call
conditions)
− the lease must include provisions and commitments that ensure the
achievement of its objectives in terms of habitat and species protection.
Land purchases must be done by one of the project participants who is either a well-
established private organisation (e.g. nature conservation NGO or other) or a public body
with nature conservation responsibility, and must remain in its ownership after the end of the
project.
The purchased land must be the subject, during the action, of specific restoration and/or
active management or restrictions of use that go beyond existing legal obligations or existing
restrictions that could be imposed without purchasing the land. The purchase of land that is
already in excellent conservation status (i.e. that requires no restoration or specific
management or restrictions of use) is eligible only very exceptionally, if indispensable for the
objectives of the project.
Evidence must be provided that the land (to be) purchased was not owned by a public
authority in the 24 months before the project application was submitted to the EU.
Compliance with all applicable conditions must be specifically demonstrated in the proposal.
In particular, proposals are expected to include:
131EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− evidence that the purchase price is consistent with the market price for the type of
land and the region concerned (e.g. letter from competent authority, registered
notary, real estate agent, etc)
− In case of land purchase, long term lease and one-off compensations, the
beneficiaries need to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness already at proposal stage.
During the project (and at the latest with the final report), we will require a copy of the sales
contract and/or entry in the land register, including the guarantee related to the long-term
conservation. For countries that do not allow to include such guarantee in land registers and
sales contract, you will be required to provide an equivalent guarantee, with the same legal
level of protection in the long term.
1.4 They must be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred (full cost; not
depreciation).

1. AMIF EMN ad hoc queries (D.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for AMIF AMN actions.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs for ‘EMN ad hoc
queries’.
This budget category covers all the eligible costs except translation costs, including but not
limited to direct personnel costs and expert costs for ad hос queries, either launched by
European Migration Network National Contact Point (EMN NCP) or the European Commission,
to which they provide a written response.
1.2 They must be declared as unit costs, using the unit cost (rate per query) agreed with
the granting authority (see AMIF authorising decision18 and Annex 2a and 2b).
The precise unit cost (amount per unit, i.e. EUR/ad hoc query answered in writing) is not
prefixed by the authorising decision. It must be calculated for each grant and then entered
into the unit cost table in Annex 2b of the Grant Agreement.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (rate per query) is:
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities using only own personnel (or personnel of
another department that is part of the same legal entity) to reply to queries:
average personnel costs for one hour spent on ad hoc query (over past two

the costs on which the flat-rate should be based, e.g. personnel costs (category A, except volunteers costs, if
any)]]. ]
1. Indirect costs (E.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes; except CEF, CCEI and
some LIFE and EUAF calls), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge the ‘Indirect
costs’.
This budget category covers all costs for the action that are not directly linked to it (i.e.
overheads).
1.2 Indirect costs are declared as a fixed flat-rate (except EDF). For most programmes the
flat-rate is fixed at 7% of the eligible direct costs in accordance with Article 184(6) EU
Financial Regulation 2024/250920; for some programmes, a higher rate is foreseen in the
Programme Regulation (basic act; see specific cases below)).
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.E, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for flat-rate costs to be eligible (i.e. costs to which the flat-
rate is applied must be eligible, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1(c))
1.4 The costs must be calculated by applying the 7% flat-rate to the eligible costs
(categories A-D, except volunteers costs and exempted specific cost categories, if any).
The calculation itself is automated: The indirect cost amount is prefilled by the IT system.
Beneficiaries can change the amount, if they would like to request less indirect costs (for
instance, because they have a parallel EU operating grant and are not able to demonstrate
cost separation; see specific cases below).
Specific cases (indirect costs (E.))
25% indirect cost flat-rate (HE, SME COSME EEN, EDF) — If this option is activated in the
Grant Agreement, the flat-rate is 25%, but the pool of eligible cost is smaller (categories A-D,
20 [old Financial Regulation: Article 181(6) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
136EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
except volunteers costs, subcontracting costs, financial support to third parties (FSTP) and
exempted specific cost categories, if any).
For Horizon Europe, all specific cost categories except D.7 ERC additional costs are exempted
(i.e. do NOT count for the flat-rate).
Example:
A public university is a beneficiary under a Grant Agreement and has incurred the following costs:
− EUR 100 000 personnel costs
− EUR 20 000 subcontracting costs
− EUR 10 000 other goods and services (consumables).
Eligible direct costs: 100 000 + 20 000 + 10 000 = EUR 130 000
Eligible indirect costs: 25 % of (100 000 + 10 000) = EUR 27 500
Total eligible costs: EUR 157 500
Other indirect cost flat-rates (RFCS, AGRIP, SMP ESS) — If other options are activated in
the Grant Agreement, the system will automatically calculate the indirect costs using those
flat-rates (e.g. RFCS 35%, AGRIP 4%, SMP ESS 30% all on category A. Personnel costs,
except volunteers costs).
Actual indirect costs (EDF) — If provided for in the call conditions, the beneficiaries may
charge actual indirect cost in accordance with the rules of the Grant Agreement (instead of a
flat-rate). Only beneficiaries whose usual cost accounting practices to calculate indirect costs
are accepted by national authorities for comparable activities in the defence domain can use
this option. This means that if your national authorities do not accept actual indirect costs for
national contracts (e.g. they accept only a simplification option like flat-rates) or you have
not carried out comparable activities in the defence domain under national contracts, you
cannot use this option. Different beneficiaries within the same action may choose different
options for their indirect costs.
Combining of EU action and operating grants — Beneficiaries that have parallel EU
action grants and operating grants may claim indirect costs in their action grants ONLY if they
are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that their operating grants do not cover any
costs which are covered by their action grants).
‘Operating grants’ are not always easy to identify. They exist under various labels (operating
grants; financial contributions/support to the functioning/operation of entities; etc). Check
your call conditions.
Example: Operating grants are grants awarded to support the running costs of certain institutions
pursuing an aim of European interest, such as: College of Europe, European standards bodies
(CEN, CENELEC, ETSI).
To demonstrate cost separation, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
− the operating grant may NOT cover 100% of the beneficiary’s annual budget (i.e. it
may not be a full operating grant)
− the beneficiary must use analytical accounting which allows for a cost accounting
management with cost allocation keys and cost accounting codes AND must apply
these keys and codes to identify and separate the costs (i.e. to allocate them to either
the action grant activities or the operating grant activities)
− the beneficiary must record:
− all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by their operating
grants (i.e. personnel, general running costs and other operating costs linked
to the operating grant work programme of activities) and
− all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by the action grant
(including the real indirect costs linked to the action)
137EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the allocation of the costs must be done in a way that leads to a fair, objective and
realistic result.
Beneficiaries that cannot fulfil these conditions must either:
− keep the operating grant, but sign the action grant without indirect costs or request
no indirect costs at reporting stage (i.e. lower the pre-filled amount in the indirect cost
column of the financial statement)
or
− renounce to the operating grant, in order to be able to claim the indirect costs in the
action grant.
Best practice: In case of overlapping EU action and operating grants, contact the granting
authority for advice.

1. Contributions (F.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (currently not in any programme), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Contributions’.
Contributions are simplified forms of output based funding. They are normally based on an
approximation of the costs, calculated ex-ante, and paid on the basis of pre-defined mile
stones/work packages. However, contrary to simplified costs (e.g. unit cost), they do not
work with funding rates (because the contribution already incorporates the funding rate in
the ex-ante calculation of the amount). This means that there is no need to apply any
funding rate to the amount claimed by the recipient in a request for payment.
139EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Currently no EU programme uses simplified contributions inside their actual cost grants (i.e.
all budget categories are calculated with a funding rate).
By contrast, full lump sum or unit grants (e.g. in HE, DEP, CEF, INNOVFUND, JTM, etc) are
usually contribution-based (meaning no funding rate needed in the budget table in Annex 2).

This may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
31 For the definition, see Article 183(2)(b) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: ‘operating grant’ means an EU grant to finance “the
functioning of a body which has an objective forming part of and supporting an EU policy”.
32 Condition must be specified in the call.
1.Types of ineligible costs and contributions
What? Costs and contributions are ineligible, if one of the following applies:
− they do not meet the general and specific eligibility conditions set out in Articles 6.1
and 6.2
Examples: Bonuses paid by participants that do not fulfil the conditions set out in Article 6.2;
subcontracting costs that do not comply with Article 6.2.
− they are listed in Article 6.3, in particular:
− costs related to return on capital or dividends paid by a beneficiary
Example: Dividends paid as remuneration for investing in the action; remuneration paid
as a share in the company’s equity.
− debt and debt service charges
‘Debt service’ is the amount paid on a loan in principal and interest, over a
period of time.
Example: A beneficiary takes a loan used to acquire equipment or consumables for the
project of EUR 100 000 at 9 percent interest for 10 years, the debt service for the first
year (principal and interest) is EUR 15 582 and cannot be declared as eligible cost.
− provisions for future losses or debts
‘Provision’ means an amount set aside in an organisation’s accounts, to cover for
a known liability of uncertain timing or amount. This includes allowances for
doubtful or bad debts.
− interest owed (e.g. negative interest charged to the beneficiary’s bank account )
− currency exchange losses (i.e. for beneficiaries using currencies other than euros
or being invoiced in a currency other than the currency they use: any loss due to
exchange rate fluctuations, e.g. between the date of invoicing and the date of
payment)
− bank costs charged by the beneficiary’s bank for transfers from the granting
authority
Conversely, bank charges for the distribution of the EU funding from the
coordinator to the beneficiaries may constitute an eligible cost for the
coordinator (if the eligibility conditions of Article 6.1 and Article 6.2.C.3 are
met).
− excessive or reckless expenditure
142EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Excessive’ means paying significantly more for products, services or personnel
than the prevailing market rates or the usual practices of the beneficiary (and
thus resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action).
‘Reckless’ means failing to exercise care in the selection of products, services or
personnel (and thus resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action).
− ineligible VAT (deductible or refundable VAT, including VAT paid by public bodies
acting as public authority)
The detailed provisions regarding the eligibility of VAT under the Financial
Regulation 2024/2509 are as follows:
VAT is eligible where it is not recoverable under the applicable national VAT
legislation AND is paid by a beneficiary other than a non-taxable person within
the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 13(1) of Directive 2006/11221
(see Article 189(4)(c) FR22).
VAT is considered ‘not recoverable’ within the meaning of Article 189(4) FR if it
is not deductible or refundable under the applicable national VAT legislation.
This is, in particular, the case if according to national law it is attributable to any
of the following activities:
− (i) exempt activities without right of deduction
− (ii) activities which fall outside the scope of VAT
− (iii) activities, as referred to in point (i) or (ii), in respect of which
VAT is not deductible but refunded by means of specific refund
schemes or compensation funds not referred to in Directive
2006/112, even if that scheme or fund is established by national VAT
legislation.
‘Non-taxable persons’ are inter alia public bodies (i.e. states, regional and local
government authorities and other bodies governed by public law) in respect of
activities or transactions in which they engage as public authorities (see Article
13(1) Directive 2006/112). However, Article 189(4) FR clarifies that, for the
purposes of eligibility of costs for EU funding, VAT relating to the activities listed
in Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112 must be regarded as paid by a ‘beneficiary
other than a non-taxable person’, regardless of whether those activities are
regarded by the Member State concerned as activities engaged in by bodies
governed by public law acting as public authorities. Thus, ‘VAT paid by public
bodies acting as public authority’ (meaning any VAT, whether
deductible/refundable or not) is ineligible for public bodies acting as public
authority. However, this does not include VAT relating to the activities listed in
Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112 which can be eligible provided they are not
deductible or refundable.
The general idea is therefore that in principle only VAT that is a genuine and
definitive cost should normally be charged to the EU actions (— however subject
to the boundaries and exceptions set out above).

143EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best practice: Ideally, VAT amounts (both if eligible and not) should be clearly
identifiable in the accounting records.
Thus, the cost and revenue accounts should exclude deductible and refundable
VAT; such VAT should be recorded in separate payable or receivable accounts,
without effect on revenue or cost line items.
VAT paid is a claim against the tax authority. It should be recorded in the
‘assets’ part of the balance sheet. It should not be recorded as expenditure in
the profit and loss accounts (only the purchase price of goods and services
excluding VAT should be recorded). Similarly, for the value of purchased
equipment or assets, only the net purchase cost should be recorded in the
balance sheet’s fixed asset line, and the depreciation cost should be calculated
based on this value, excluding VAT.
VAT collected is a debt towards the tax authority and should therefore be
recorded in the ‘liabilities’ part of the balance sheet.
If applicable (most programmes; except CEF, EUAF, CCEI, UCPM), VAT that
does NOT fall under the above kinds of ineligible VAT can be eligible and
charged under the category of cost to which it relates.
− costs incurred during the suspension of the implementation of the action
Example: Action is suspended and one of the beneficiaries continues working on it after
the date of the suspension
− in-kind contributions for free (these are not a cost for the beneficiary; except in
HE where they can be charged as eligible costs; see Article 6.1)
− costs declared under another EU grant (i.e. double funding), except for
‘Synergies actions’ or operating grants
This includes:
− costs funded directly by other EU programmes managed by the European
Commission or EU executive agencies
− costs managed/funded/awarded by Member States but co-funded from
the EU budget (e.g. Structural Funds, RRF, etc)
− costs for grants awarded/funded/managed by other EU, international or
national bodies and co-funded with EU funds (e.g. joint undertakings,
Article 185 TFEU bodies)
− costs or contributions for staff of a national (or regional/local) administration, for
activities that are part of the administration’s normal activities (i.e. not
undertaken only because of the grant) cannot be charged to the project.
However, if additional otherwise normal activities are implemented directly and
specifically for the project, such cost can be declared, even if they are the same
kind of activities as the administration’s normal tasks. These must be activities
that are implemented due to the action and either additional in quality (different
in nature or conditions) or quantity (more than usual), to the normal operations
of the national (or regional/local) administration.
Example: Giving a fine for speed excess may be considered as a normal activity of
the police, but if this is done in a specific place for a specific time due to the
implementation of a LIFE project testing new speed limits to improve air quality, they
are different in quality and/or quantity to what the police would have done otherwise
and therefore directly and specifically implemented for the action.
144EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− costs or contributions (especially travel and subsistence) for staff or
representatives of EU institutions, bodies or agencies
− for restricted calls due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security
reasons (HE, DEP, EDF and CEF-DIG): costs or contributions for activities that do
not take place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions — unless approved by the granting authority
− cost declared specifically ineligible in the call conditions.
2. Declaration of ineligible costs or contributions
If a participant declares ineligible costs or contributions in a financial statement, they will be
rejected by the granting authority (see Article 27).
Specific cases (ineligible costs):
Partially deductible VAT — Some entities have a mixed VAT regime, meaning that they
carry out VAT exempt or out-of-the-scope activities AND VAT taxed activities. When VAT paid
on goods or services by these entities cannot be directly allocated to one or the other
category of activities, it will be partially deductible. Therefore it will also be partially eligible.
The eligible part corresponds to the pro-rata of the VAT which is not deductible for that
entity.
In these cases, the beneficiary uses a provisional (estimated) deduction ratio during the year.
The final ratio is only determined at the end of the financial year. The beneficiary must
regularise VAT when closing its accounts. Therefore, the beneficiary must also regularize the
VAT costs declared for the grant (by declaring, in the next reporting period, an adjustment
for the difference between the provisional deduction ratio and the final ratio).
VAT incurred in non-EU countries — VAT which cannot be refunded in third countries may
be considered eligible under certain conditions. The beneficiaries must be able to show that
their request for exemption has been rejected by the competent authorities or the applicable
legislation which stipulate that VAT cannot be refunded.
If a beneficiary receives a VAT refund after the receipt of the final payment, it needs to
inform the granting authority which may recover amounts unduly paid.
Non-identifiable VAT in foreign invoices — In exceptional cases where the beneficiary
cannot identify the VAT charged by the supplier (e.g. small non-EU invoices), the full
purchase price can be recorded in the accounts if it is not possible to deduct/refund the VAT.
That VAT would therefore be eligible.
Duties — The eligibility of duties depends on the eligibility of the cost item to which they are
linked (i.e. in whose price they are included). If the item is eligible, the duty is also eligible.
Combining EU Synergy actions — Different EU grants can be combined if the combined
actual funding rate over all eligible costs of the project does not go above 100% AND the
grant is flagged as ‘Synergy action’ (see Data Sheet, Point 1). If the synergy is not already
coordinated by the granting authorities from the outset (as a ‘Synergy call’, i.e. coordinated
call by both granting authorities with combined fixed funding rates that do not go above
100%; see also Article 3), the beneficiaries need to inform the granting authorities if they
apply for and receive more than one source of EU funding for the action. To prevent double
funding and subsequent cost rejections and recoveries, the granting authorities will assess
adaptations of the action(s) on a case-by-case basis (this may include partitioning of the
action, rejection/reduction of eligible cost, etc).
Best practice: If you notice that your grant is not flagged as ‘Synergy action’ although it
should be, contact the granting authority to see if it is possible to make an amendment.
145EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Combining EU actions with the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) actions —
Except in very exceptional circumstances (see below) EU grants can NOT be combined with
RRF actions because the funding model of the RRF (which finances milestones and targets
without direct connection to individual project costs) makes it normally not possible to
combine RRF funding with other EU funding for the same set of activities (and costs). If the
same project should nonetheless receive funding from an EU programme and the RRF, the
project must be designed as separate actions, clearly delineated and separated for each part
(without overlaps of activities (and costs)).
In exceptional cases where it is established that an ex-ante cost delineation is not feasible or
excessively burdensome, the granting authority may agree to allow combining support from
the RRF and other directly managed programmes on a pro-rata basis (i.e. combined support
for the same project) as a last resort under certain strict conditions.23 One of these conditions
is that the combined support (i.e. grant from the directly managed programme + RRF Grant)
does not exceed the eligible costs under the directly managed programme.
This implies that the EU granting authority will need to check and verify at the level of the
beneficiary how much RRF funding the project received and lower the amount of the EU grant
(by either lowering the requested grant amount or rejecting costs) where the combined RRF
support and directly managed EU grant exceed 100% of the eligible costs under the EU
managed grant. Where the support from the directly managed programme takes the form of
a lump sum, the eligible costs will be assumed to be those that were accepted during grant
preparation and which were used as the basis for defining the lump sum amount in the EU
grant agreement.
Combining of EU action and operating grants — EU action grants can be combined with
EU operating grants if the beneficiaries are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that the
operating grant does not cover any costs which are already covered by the action grants, in
particular indirect costs already covered by the action grant). If cost separation cannot be
demonstrated, beneficiaries can still keep both grants, but must renounce to the flat-rate on
indirect cost in the action grant (since the indirect cost are already considered to be covered
by the operating grant). For detailed conditions, see Article 6.2.E.
Example: Operating grants are grants awarded to support the running costs of certain institutions
pursuing an aim of European interest, such as: College of Europe, European standards bodies
(CEN, CENELEC, ETSI).

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES
AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS
General > Article 7 — Beneficiaries
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting authority for
implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance with all the
obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action under their own
responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated entities or other participants (see
Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the beneficiaries fails to
implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure that this part is implemented by
someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the maximum grant amount and subject to an
amendment; see Article 39). The financial responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed
by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding the grant for the
entire duration of the action. Costs and contributions will be eligible only as long as the beneficiary and the
action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any events or
circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the implementation of the action (see
Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the pre-financing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if
required; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article 21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority under the
Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their affiliated
entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and the granting
authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies otherwise, and in
particular:
147EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- submit the pre-financing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify their quality
and completeness before passing them on to the granting authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other beneficiaries
(report on the distribution of payments; if required, see Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other beneficiaries
without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary or third
party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii) last indent and
(iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have created or which are controlled by or
affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance
with the obligations under the Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’33 (or similar, such as European research infrastructure
consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to one of their members. The
coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-ordination, to ensure that
the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written
consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of recoveries (if
any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article 16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION for programmes with linked actions: [OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked actions, the
beneficiaries must have arrangements with the participants of the other action, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written
collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the consortium is the same, as part of
their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
33 For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy the criteria for being awarded a
grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the
purpose of implementing the action financed by the grant.”
148EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of outputs,
common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy activities, common
communication and dissemination activities, sharing of information, access to background and
results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in both actions.
The arrangements with the participants of the other action must not contain any provision contrary to this
Agreement.] ]
1. Division of roles and responsibilities — Responsibilities towards the granting
authority — Technical and financial responsibility for the action
The beneficiaries are formal parties to the Grant Agreement (they sign the Grant Agreement
or Accession Forms). They have direct contractual obligations under the Grant Agreement
and are fully responsible for implementing the action properly (see Article 11).
This means that:
− each beneficiary must ensure that it complies with its obligations under the Grant
Agreement
− each beneficiary must ensure swift and proper implementation of the action (i.e. that
there are no delays and that the work is done properly)
− each beneficiary is responsible (towards the granting authority) for the tasks
performed by its subcontractors, affiliated entities and associated partners
− the granting authority is NOT responsible for the implementation of the action and has
NO responsibility for the way in which the action is conducted (or any adverse
consequences).
The beneficiaries are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. This
means that they (and any new beneficiaries added later on during the project through an
amendment) accept that they are together responsible for fully implementing the whole
project.
If one of the beneficiaries leaves the action (irrespective of the reason), the remaining
partners must carry out the action as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1)
— including the part of the defaulting beneficiary. They will have to do this without any
additional funding. The Grant Agreement will have to be amended, in order to redistribute the
tasks, terminate the beneficiary’s participation, and/or add a new beneficiary (see Article 39).
Example: Beneficiaries A, B and C have signed a Grant Agreement with a duration of three years
with the Commission in order to carry out an action. One year later, beneficiary C goes bankrupt.
Beneficiaries A and B remain fully responsible to implement the whole action, including the tasks
of C. A and B must agree that one (or both) take over the part of beneficiary C (or ensure
replacement by adding a new beneficiary), to make sure that the entire action is implemented as
described in Annex 1.
From a financial point of view, each participant is in principle responsible for the proper and
sound financial management of their part of the grant. In case of recoveries, there may
however, depending on the programme and Grant Agreement, be certain situations where
beneficiaries may be held responsible for their partners (financial liability):
149EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): the financial liability is as
follows:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation, but not intervene to recover this money (no debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole
amount that needs to be recovered (i.e. paid back to the granting authority)—
even if it has not been the final recipient of the concerned amount (debit note);
if the coordinator does not pay (irrespective of the reason), the granting
authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, drawing on the pre-
financing guarantee, joint and several liability of other beneficiaries or affiliated
entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see Article 22.4)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): each beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle
limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by their affiliated
entities. It is only for the contribution to the MIM that financial responsibility is
shared:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation and, if the beneficiary doesn’t pay, the granting authority may call
on the MIM to intervene and then start a recovery procedure against the
beneficiary for the account of the MIM (debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the contribution to the MIM will be used to
cover recoveries (if any); if the contribution is not sufficient, the coordinator
will be asked to pay back the amount owed (as representative of the
consortium); if the debt is not paid but the report on the distribution of
payments was provided, the granting authority will calculate the share of the
debt per beneficiary and confirm the amount to be recovered from each of
them separately (debit note); if they do not pay (irrespective of the reason),
the granting authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, joint and
several liability of affiliated entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see
Article 22.4); if the report on the distribution of payments was NOT provided,
the granting authority will enforce recovery against the coordinator (debit
note); if needed, the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and
will then continue recovery for the account of the MIM (second debit note
replacing the first)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note); no MIM intervention (new for 2021-
2027).
Beneficiaries are always liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities (see Article
22.2).
2. Division of roles and responsibilities — Roles and responsibilities within the
consortium
The general division of roles and responsibilities within the consortium is as follows:
− the coordinator must coordinate and manage the grant and is the central contact point
for the granting authority
150EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the beneficiaries and other participants must all together contribute to a smooth and
successful implementation of the grant (i.e. contribute to the proper implementation
of the action, comply with their own obligations under the Grant Agreement and
support the coordinator in his obligations).
All communication with the granting authority should in principle go through the coordinator.
Documents/information should be submitted via the coordinator — unless, for specific cases,
the granting authority requests individual partners to provide such information directly (e.g.
in case of an audit, the beneficiaries must submit the documents requested directly to the
auditors, see Article 25).
Other participants (i.e. affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors, etc) may be
part of the consortium, if this is considered useful by the beneficiaries. It is generally
recommended to involve all entities that are important for the successful implementation of
the project, independently of their formal role in the grant.
3. The coordinator’s roles and responsibilities
The coordinator is the central contact point for the granting authority and represents the
consortium (towards the granting authority).
For this purpose, the Grant Agreement imposes a number of specific coordination tasks.
Coordination tasks:
▪ Monitor that the action is implemented properly
▪ Act as the intermediary for all communications — unless the Grant Agreement
specifies otherwise
▪ Request and review documents or information required by the granting authority
and verify their completeness and correctness
▪ Submit the deliverables and reports in the system
▪ Submit the pre-financing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
▪ Distribute payments to the other beneficiaries, without unjustified delay
▪ Inform the granting authority of the amounts paid to each beneficiary, if requested
to do so (see Articles 22 and 32)
The coordination tasks include quality-checking of documents/information submitted by the
beneficiaries, in particular:
− reviewing the individual financial statements from each beneficiary to verify
consistency with the action tasks, as well as completeness and correctness
− verifying that all the requested documents/information have been provided by the
beneficiary (e.g. the use of resources, etc)
− verifying that the beneficiary submits the documents/information in the requested
format
− verifying that the technical information submitted by a beneficiary concerns its action
tasks as described in Annex 1 (and not something unrelated to the action).
The coordinator is not, however, obliged to verify the eligibility of the costs declared, nor to
request justifications. Each beneficiary/affiliated entity remains responsible for the cost it
declares (both as regards eligibility and as regards sufficient records and supporting
documents to substantiate them).
151EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The coordination tasks listed above can NOT be subcontracted or outsourced to another
entity including other beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, or associated partners.
They can only be delegated, under certain circumstances, to entities with ‘authorisation to
administer’ or in the case of ‘sole beneficiaries’ within the meaning of Article 190(2) of the
Financial Regulation 2024/250924 (see below).
By contrast, the coordinator remains free — like any other beneficiary — to use affiliated
entities or subcontractors for other tasks; see Articles 8 and 9.3).
Specific cases (coordinator responsibilities):
‘Entities with authorisation to administer’ — Coordinators that are public bodies may
exceptionally delegate coordination tasks (e.g. the administration of the payments) to
another entity, if this is their usual practice (e.g. a foundation).
For the handling of such coordinator tasks, this other entity must fulfil the following
conditions:
− it must participate as an affiliated entity of the coordinator
and
− it must have been granted an ‘authorisation to administer’ in order to handle the
coordinator’s administrative affairs (and those must include receiving and
administering EU funds).
In this case, the bank account number to be provided by the coordinator during grant
preparation must be that of the entity with the authorisation to administer. The payments will
then be transferred directly to it and it will have to distribute them for the coordinator.
Since they participate as affiliated entity, the entity must be registered in the Participant
Register (have a PIC) and be validated by the Central Validation Service.
The coordinator will remain fully responsible for the entity under the Grant Agreement. For
detailed guidance, see the specific cases in Article 8.
‘Sole beneficiaries’ (or similar, e.g. ERICs25) — Entities which form one joint entity for the
purpose of implementing the action and all comply with the eligibility criteria can participate
as ‘sole beneficiaries’ in EU actions (see Article 190(2) FR 2024/250926). Coordinators which
are sole beneficiaries (or similar, e.g. European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERICs))
and do not have their own resources may exceptionally delegate the coordination tasks to
one of their members. Coordinators using one of their members remain fully responsible for
them under the Grant Agreement.
Technical/scientific coordination (or similar) — The coordinator within the meaning of
the Grant Agreement is the beneficiary in charge of the (administrative) coordination tasks
set out in this Article. Other kinds of coordination activities, i.e. tasks not listed in this Article
(e.g. of technical or scientific nature) can be carried out by any other participant.
These participants may internally (i.e. within the consortium) be called, for example,
‘technical’ or ‘scientific coordinator’, but they will NOT be considered coordinator in the
meaning of the Grant Agreement and are not subject to the rules in Article 7.
24 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(2) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
25 Council Regulation (EC) No 723/2009 of 25 June 2009 on the Community legal framework for a European
Research Infrastructure Consortium (OJ L 206, 08.08.2009, p.1).
26 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(2) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
152EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs for this type of technical/scientific coordination are eligible, if they comply with the
eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.
4. Internal arrangements between beneficiaries — Consortium agreement
The participants should (mandatory for multi-beneficiary grants, if required in the Data
Sheet) conclude a consortium agreement to ensure a smooth and successful action
implementation.
The ‘consortium agreement’ is an agreement between members of the consortium, to set out
their internal arrangements for implementing the project and the administration of the EU
grant. It is purely internal; it should NOT be submitted to the granting authority for
information or review; the granting authority is NOT party and has NO responsibility for it
(nor for any adverse consequences).
Best practice: In view of their importance for avoiding disputes and ensuring a smooth
implementation of the grant, we strongly recommend that every consortium sets up a
consortium agreement, even if not mandatory in the Data Sheet. In any case, the
beneficiaries need to put in place all necessary arrangements regarding their operation and
co-ordination to ensure the proper implementation of the action.
The consortium agreement should complement the Grant Agreement and must NOT contain
any provision contrary to it (or the applicable EU, international or national law).
It should in principle be negotiated and concluded before grant signature (i.e. each
beneficiary should sign the consortium agreement before signing the Accession Form to
accede to the Grant Agreement). Otherwise, there is usually a serious risk that prolonged
disagreement jeopardises the action. Of course, the consortium agreement does not have to
remain the same during the lifetime of the action, it can be modified by the consortium at
any moment.
The duration should at least cover the time until the final payment, however, a longer or
open-ended duration, where relevant, should be considered in order to fully cover any issues
that may emerge after the final payment, such as exploitation of the results (e.g. licensing),
issues arising from audits, etc.
The agreement must be in writing. It may be a simple written agreement or take some other
form (e.g. a notarial deed or part of the statutes of a separate legal entity, such as a
European Economic Interest Grouping, association or joint venture).
For guidance on consortium agreements, see How to draw up your consortium agreement. This
document has been developed for H2020 actions (MFF 2014-2020), but it can also serve for
inspiration in other EU programmes and for the new MFF 2021-2027. In case of questions, please
contact the granting authority.
5. Relationship with beneficiaries of linked actions — Collaboration agreement
The participants of linked actions must make arrangements to determine and coordinate
implementation in the areas where close collaboration is needed and should conclude a
collaboration agreement (mandatory if required in the Data Sheet), to ensure that linked
actions are implemented and coordinated properly.
‘Collaboration agreement’ are agreements between the participants of linked actions to
coordinate their work. The granting authority is not party and has NO responsibility for them
(nor for any adverse consequences). If the consortium in the linked actions is the same, the
collaboration agreement may be included as part of the consortium agreement.
The collaboration agreement should complement the Grant Agreement and must NOT contain
any provision contrary to it (or the applicable EU, international or national law).
153EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
It should set out the details on the collaboration and synchronisation of the activities as well
as on the internal organisation and decision processes of the linked actions. If considered
useful, it can also foresee common boards and advisory structures. These will complement
the governance of each of the linked actions; they can NOT replace the consortium and other
project governance mechanisms that are required for the EU action (if applicable).
For guidance on collaboration agreements, see How to draw up your collaboration agreement.
This document has been developed for H2020 actions (MFF 2014-2020), but it can also serve for
inspiration in other EU programmes and for the new MFF 2021-2027. In case of questions, please
contact the granting authority.

General > Article 8 — Affiliated entities
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
[OPTION 1 for programmes without affiliated entities: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with affiliated entities (standard): [OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The
following entities which are linked to a beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘affiliated entities’:
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short name)]
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short name)]
[same for more AE]
Affiliated entities can charge costs and contributions to the action under the same conditions as the
beneficiaries and must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in accordance with Article
11.
Their costs and contributions will be included in Annex 2 and will be taken into account for the calculation of
the grant.
The beneficiaries must ensure that all their obligations under this Agreement also apply to their affiliated
entities.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the affiliated entities.
Breaches by affiliated entities will be handled in the same manner as breaches by beneficiaries. Recovery of
undue amounts will be handled through the beneficiaries.
If the granting authority requires joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4),
they must sign the declaration set out in Annex 3a and may be held liable in case of enforced recoveries
against their beneficiaries (see Article 22.2 and 22.4).]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable] ]
1. Affiliated entities
Affiliated entities (in some programmes formerly called ‘linked third parties’; new for 2021-
2027) are entities with a (usually legal or capital) link to a beneficiary and which implement
parts of the action and are allowed to charge costs directly to the grant.
They do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA) but can be part of
the consortium and often play an important role in implementing the action. Therefore, the
Grant Agreement mentions them by name and defines their role (rights and obligations).
In practice, they are treated in many ways like beneficiaries (have their own financial
statement, must provide their own CFS, must contribute to the technical report, must submit
deliverables, etc).
Annotations in this AGA which refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to
affiliated entities (just like the provisions of the MGA themselves; see also MGA
Preamble).
For technical and security reasons, affiliated entities do NOT however have direct
access to the Portal My Area section (see Article 36). They therefore always need to go
through their beneficiaries (to sign the declaration of honour, submit financial statements,
contribute to the technical report, etc).
155EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Characteristics of implementation by affiliated entities:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1 (including the
handling of subcontracting, financial support to third parties (FSTP), etc).
▪ They do not charge a ‘price’, but declare their own costs.
▪ The work is and is usually carried out on their premises, under their full and direct
control, instructions and management, with their own employees.
▪ The beneficiary remains responsible towards the granting authority for the work
carried out by its affiliated entities and for the recovery of undue payments from
its affiliated entities (if any).
‘Link to the beneficiaries’ means in particular a legal or capital link, which is neither limited to
the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation (see Article 190(1)(b)
FR 2024/250927). This covers:
− permanent legal structures (e.g. the relationship between an association and its
members)
− contractual cooperation not limited to the action (e.g. an existing collaboration
agreement for activities in a field relevant to the action;)
− capital link, i.e.
− direct or indirect control of the beneficiary
− under the same direct or indirect control as the beneficiary
or
− directly or indirectly controlling the beneficiary.
Moreover, it covers not only the case of parent companies or holdings and their daughter
companies or subsidiaries and vice-versa, but also the case of affiliates between themselves
(e.g. entities controlled by the same entity).
Examples:
1. Company A established in France holding 20% of the shares in Company B established in Italy.
However, with 20% of the shares, it has 60% of the voting rights in company B. Therefore,
company A controls company B and both companies may be affiliated entities.
2. Company X and company Y do not control each other, but they are both owned by company Z.
They are both considered affiliated entities.
3. The Ministry A is in accordance with national law the supervisory authority of a national agency.
They can be considered as affiliated entities. Conversely, if the national agency is by statute set up
as independent from the central government, the agency and the Ministry should instead
participate as separate beneficiaries (or other fitting roles).
4. Associations, foundations or other legal entities composed of members — That entity is generally
the beneficiary and the members are the affiliated entities.
5. Joint Research Units (JRU) (i.e. research laboratories/infrastructures created and owned by two
or more different legal entities in order to carry out research) — They do not have a separate legal
personality, but form a single research unit where staff and resources from the different members
are put together to the benefit of all. Though lacking legal personality, they exist physically, with
27 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(1)(b) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
156EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
premises, equipment, and resources that belong to them. A member of the JRU can be the
beneficiary and other members can participate as affiliated entities. The JRU has to meet all the
following conditions:
− scientific and economic unity
− last a certain length of time
− recognised by a public authority.
It is necessary that the JRU itself is recognised by a public authority, i.e. an entity identified as
such under the applicable national law. The beneficiary must provide to the granting authority, a
copy of the resolution, law, decree, decision, attesting the relationship between the beneficiary and
the affiliated entity(ies), or a copy of the document establishing the joint research unit, or any
other document that proves that research facilities are put in a common structure and correspond
to the concept of scientific and economic unit.
Just like beneficiaries, affiliated entities must normally fulfil the conditions for participation
and funding.
Example: Company A established in Germany is a beneficiary in a grant. A owns B, a French
company and also owns C, a company established in a non-EU country not associated to the
programme. B and C may be considered affiliates to A, however only B may participate as
affiliated entity to A, because company C is established in a non-associated third country and is
therefore not eligible. C can instead participate as an associated partner.
Affiliated entities must be listed in Article 8, their tasks must be mentioned in Annex 1 and
their budget in Annex 2.There is NO simplified approval procedure.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the action tasks done by
affiliated entities (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that the affiliated entities comply with the same obligations as
they themselves (mutatis mutandis).
Obligations that must be extended to affiliated entities:
▪ all obligations (mutatis mutandis)
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
affiliated entities.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the affiliated
entities, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the affiliated
entities, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (affiliated entities):
Joint and several liability of affiliated entities — The granting authority may (during
grant preparation) require joint and several liability of an affiliated entity, if:
− the financial capacity of a beneficiary is ‘weak’ and
− the beneficiary mainly coordinates the work of its affiliated entity.
Examples:
1. The financially weak beneficiary is an association and most of the work is carried out by several
of its members as affiliated entities.
2. The financially weak beneficiary is a small company with a substantial part of its work
implemented by a bigger affiliated entity.
3. The proposal submitted by four independent entities established in four Member States is
positively evaluated. The four successful applicants decide to form a legal entity to simplify the
management of the project. The newly established entity will be the beneficiary, i.e. a new legal
entity. The successful applicants will carry out the work as affiliated entities of the new legal entity.
157EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If requested, the affiliated entity must accept joint and several liability with their beneficiary.
In this case, it must sign a declaration (on paper and in blue-ink, using the Annex 3a
generated by the system) to be submitted by the beneficiary at the moment of its accession
to the grant (or amendment adding the affiliated entity). The affiliated entity must send the
original to the beneficiary (by registered post with proof of delivery), who must upload it (as
a scanned PDF copy) in the system.
The liability is for any amount owned by the beneficiary under the Grant Agreement, and up
to the affiliated entity’s maximum EU contribution in Annex 2.
More details on the financial capacity check are available in the Online Manual > Participant
Register > Financial capacity assessment on the Portal.
Entities created in order to manage administrative/financial tasks (including
‘entities with authorisation to administer’) — These are typically legal entities
(foundations, spin-off companies, etc), created or controlled by a beneficiary (usually a public
body like a university/ministry) to handle the financial and administrative aspects of the
beneficiaries’ involvement e.g. in EU actions.
If they handle coordinator tasks (see Article 7) or implement action tasks themselves, they
have to participate as affiliated entity of the beneficiary/coordinator and have to declare their
own costs.
Resources they put at the disposal of their beneficiary for the action implementation should in
principle also be charged by them as affiliated entity.
However, for HE, in case different funding rates are applied for the beneficiary versus the
affiliated entity, the costs can also be declared by the beneficiary:
− if the resources are provided against payment: in accordance with rules of the
appropriate cost category (e.g. Article 6.2.A.3 for personnel put at the disposal of the
beneficiary; Article 6.2.C.2 for equipment or Article 6.2.C.3 for other goods, works and
services)
− if the resources are provided for free: in accordance with the rules on eligibility of in-
kind contributions (see Article 6.1).
Best practice: It is recommended to describe in the DoA Annex 1 the relation between the
beneficiary and the foundation/spin-off and its impact on the Grant Agreement.

ARTICLE 9 — OTHER PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN THE ACTION
9.1 Associated partners
[OPTION 1 for programmes without associated partners: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with associated partners (standard): [OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The
following entities which cooperate with a beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘associated partners’:
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number] [associated partner of [BEN legal name (short
name)]]
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number] [associated partner of [BEN legal name (short
name)]]
[same for more AP]
Associated partners must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in accordance with Article
11. They may not charge costs or contributions to the action and the costs for their tasks are not eligible.
The tasks must be set out in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their contractual obligations under Articles 11 (proper implementation),
12 (conflict of interests), 13 (confidentiality and security), 14 (ethics), 17.2 (visibility), 18 (specific rules for
carrying out action), 19 (information) and 20 (record-keeping) also apply to the associated partners.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the associated partners.]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable] ]
1. Associated partners
Associated partners are entities that implement action tasks, but without receiving EU
funding.
They do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign an accession form), but they
implement parts of the action and are thus often involved actively in the consortium.
Therefore, the Grant Agreement mentions them by name and defines their role (rights and
obligations).
Characteristics of implementation by associated partners:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ They participate at own costs (do not receive EU funding).
▪ The consortium (or, in case the associated partner cooperates with a specific
beneficiary as named in Article 9.1, that beneficiary) remains responsible towards
the granting authority for the work performed by the associated partners.
Associated partners do NOT need to have a (capital or legal) link to any beneficiary (but they
may have one).
159EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Since they do not receive EU funding, associated partners do NOT have to comply with the
eligibility conditions (but they may)).
Associated partners must be listed in Article 9.1, their tasks must be mentioned in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the tasks implemented by
associated partners (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations:
Obligations that must be extended to associated partners:
▪ Proper implementation (see Article 11), including compliance with call conditions
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific9 rules for the action implementation (see Article 18), including
compliance with specific rules set out in Annex 5
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
associated partners (e.g. via contractual arrangements, consortium agreement, etc).
The beneficiaries must also ensure that the associated partners respect the call conditions
and Annex 5.
Example: In Horizon Europe, the Grant Agreement provides for additional obligations in Annex 5
regarding results, e.g. open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications which applies to all such
publications under the Grant Agreement, including publications where associated partners are
involved.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
associated partners, particular concerning the action implementation.

9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions
[OPTION 1 for programmes with in-kind contributions allowed but not eligible (standard):
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods,
works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge), if necessary for the implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not charge costs or
contributions to the action and the costs for the in-kind contributions are not eligible.
The third parties and their in-kind contributions should be set out in Annex 1.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with in-kind contributions eligible:
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods,
works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge) if necessary for the implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not charge costs or
contributions to the action, but the costs for the in-kind contributions are eligible and may be charged by the
beneficiaries which use them, under the conditions set out in Article 6. The costs will be included in Annex 2
as part of the beneficiaries’ costs.
The third parties and their in-kind contributions should be set out in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the third parties giving in-kind contributions. ]
[OPTION 3 for programmes with in-kind contributions not allowed:
In-kind contributions (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods and services, etc. given by third parties free-of-
charge) are not allowed for the implementation of the action.]
1. Third parties providing in-kind contributions: In-kind contributions allowed but
not eligible
This is the standard rule for most EU programmes. Beneficiaries may use in-kind
contributions provided by third parties, if necessary to implement the action, but they are not
counted towards the project budget (not eligible costs).
Examples (in-kind contributions allowed but not eligible):
1. Civil servant working as a professor in a public university is also working on the action. His salary
is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but by the government (the ministry). It can therefore
not be charged to the EU grant.
2. A entity providing learning spaces for free to the beneficiaries, for example a municipality for an
NGO part of the project.
3. A graphic company providing for free the design of booklets.
In-kind contributions refers only to the case where a third party makes available some
of its resources to a beneficiary for free (i.e. without any payment; new for 2021-2027). In
this case, the beneficiary itself makes no payment and there is therefore NO cost incurred by
the beneficiary. There are therefore normally NO costs that can be charged to the action (—
unless specifically provided for in the Programme Regulation, e.g. for HE).
By contrast, if there is any payment by the beneficiary to the third party for the in-kind
contribution provided, the beneficiary can declare the costs in the appropriate cost category:
− personnel costs for seconded persons (see Article 6.2.A.3)
− renting costs for equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2) or
− purchase costs for other goods, works and services (see Article 6.2.C.3).
161EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Third parties providing in-kind contributions: In-kind contributions eligible
For some EU programmes (only HE), the Programme Regulation (basic act) allows in-kind
contribution costs to be charged to the action.
Examples (in-kind contributions eligible): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university is also working on the action. His salary is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but
by the government (the ministry). In Horizon Europe, the beneficiary may charge these costs to the
grant, even if they are incurred by a third party (the ministry/government).
The eligibility conditions for such costs are set out in Article 6.1. However, in kind
contributions against payment ARE NOT a budget category: Depending on the type of cost,
they must be declared in, and comply with, the fitting budget category (e.g. personnel costs,
equipment).
In-kind contributions and the third parties contributing them must be mentioned in Annex 1
(simplified approval procedure; see below).
Moreover, if in-kind contributions are charged to the action, the beneficiaries must also
ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, the European Court
of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks,
reviews, audits and investigations on the third parties, and in particular to audit their costs. If
access is denied by the third party, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (in-kind contributions eligible):
Simplified approval procedure (new in-kind contributions) — For programmes where
in-kind contributions are eligible (only HE), if the need for an in-kind contribution was not
known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to introduce
the new contribution into the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure; for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the
beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting authority might not approve the new
contribution and reject the costs at interim or final payment-stage later on.

[OPTION 1 for programmes without subcontractors (ineligible): Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with subcontractors (standard): Subcontractors may participate in the action, if
necessary for the implementation.
Subcontractors must implement their action tasks in accordance with Article 11. The costs for the
subcontracted tasks (invoiced price from the subcontractor) are eligible and may be charged by the
beneficiaries, under the conditions set out in Article 6. The costs will be included in Annex 2 as part of the
beneficiaries’ costs.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their contractual obligations under Articles 11 (proper implementation),
12 (conflict of interest), 13 (confidentiality and security), 14 (ethics), 17.2 (visibility), 18 (specific rules for
carrying out action), 19 (information) and 20 (record-keeping) also apply to the subcontractors.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the subcontractors. ]
1. Subcontractors
Subcontractors do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA), but they
often implement important parts of the action (i.e. action tasks specified in Annex 1) and
thus may need to be involved actively in the consortium. Therefore, the Grant Agreement
mentions them and defines their role (rights and obligations).
Characteristics of subcontractors:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ charges a price, which usually includes a profit (— this distinguishes it from
affiliated entities; see Article 8), to be declared as subcontracting costs by a
beneficiary.
▪ The work is carried out without the direct supervision of the beneficiary and is not
hierarchically subordinate to the beneficiary (— this distinguishes it from action
tasks implemented by in-house consultants; see Article 6.2.A.2).
▪ The motivation is pecuniary, not the work on the project itself. The subcontractor
is paid by the beneficiary in exchange for its work.
▪ The beneficiary remains fully responsible towards the granting authority for action
tasks performed by its subcontractors.
Example (subcontract): A Grant Agreement for an action on nature reserves describes in
Annex 1 two action tasks. The first task concerns a comparative study of water quality in the
reserve, which the beneficiary’s employee will compile after taking and sending water samples
to laboratories. The lab work is necessary for the implementation of the action but only a
subactivity of compiling the study (the action task), therefore it will fall under purchase costs
(see Article 6.2.C). The second task concerns an aerial survey of the water bodies for which the
beneficiary does not have the necessary know-how and assets and therefore subcontracts to a
service provider who will implement the survey (the action task) through activities like aerial
photography and analysis.
163EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The action tasks to be subcontracted and the estimated costs (not necessarily the
subcontractor, especially if not known yet) must be identified and justified in Annex 1 (Article
6.2.B; simplified approval procedure; see below).
Normally you are NOT obliged to give information about the names of the subcontractors
selected (in DoA Annex 1 or periodic report), but many programmes require this information
indirectly through the detailed budget/cost reporting table.
Best practice: If you think that there is an issue with a subcontractor that might impact the
eligibility of subcontracting costs (e.g. potential conflict of interest; subcontractor not in
compliance with the call conditions or subject to sanctions, etc), inform the granting
authority and ask for specific guidance.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the subcontracted action
tasks by the subcontractors (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations:
Obligations that must be extended to subcontractors:
▪ Proper implementation (see Article 11), including compliance with call conditions
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18), including
compliance with specific rules set out in Annex 5
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
subcontractors (e.g. via contractual arrangements, consortium agreement, etc).
The beneficiaries must also ensure that the subcontractors respect the the call conditions and
Annex 5.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
subcontractors, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
subcontractor, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (subcontractors):
Simplified approval procedure (new subcontracts) — If the need for a subcontract was
not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to
introduce the subcontracting of one or more tasks in Annex 1 (see Article 39) or, if allowed,
flag it in the periodic report (simplified approval procedure; allowed for most programmes;
for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk that the
granting authority might not approve the new subcontracting of the task(s) and reject the
costs at interim or final payment-stage later on.

Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the recipients.]
1. Recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)
Recipients of financial support to third parties (grants, prizes or other) do not become party
to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA) and are not part of the consortium. They do not
implement action tasks, but they benefit from them and receive (indirectly) a part of the EU
funding. Therefore, the Grant Agreement defines their role (rights and obligations).
Characteristics of FSTP recipients:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They do not perform action tasks, but the financial support given to them is part of
an action task specified in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ They receive financial support from the grant (e.g. sub-grant or prize money), to
be declared as financial support to third parties cost by a beneficiary.
The beneficiaries remain responsible towards the granting authority for the proper use of the
funding by the recipients.
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations, where
relevant/applicable based on the nature of the action:
Obligations that must be extended to FSTP recipients:
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding, as appropriate (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18)
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
165EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
recipients (e.g. via cascading call conditions or contractual arrangements, scholarship
agreement, rules of contest, etc).
Moreover, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office

recipients, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
recipient, the costs will be rejected.

consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. Non-EU participants
Non-EU participants are not a separate category of participants, but simply participants (e.g.
beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner, subcontractor) that are not legally
established in one of the EU Member States. They can usually participate in EU funding
programmes, if:
− their country is associated to the programme (so-called ‘associated country’) —
standard case
OR
− if the programme is open to participation and funding of entities from third countries
— rare (e.g. HE, RELEX).
Since non-EU participants are normally not subject to EU law, the Grant Agreement recalls
the most important principles and makes them contractually binding. Thus, participants
undertake to comply with all their obligations under the Grant Agreement and commit to:
− respect key principles, such as fundamental rights, EU values and ethical principles,
environmental and labour standards, security of information rules, respect for IPR
protection and privacy
− use appropriate audit standards as well as qualified and independent external auditors
− allow for checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the bodies mentioned in Article
25 (e.g. granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-
Fraud Office (OLAF))
167EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Moreover, since non-EU participants are regularly located outside the jurisdiction of the EU
courts (General Court, Court of Justice), disputes will be settled by the courts of Brussels,
Belgium (— unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU court
judgments).
Specific cases (non-EU participants):
International organisations (IOs) — International organisations do NOT fall under Article
10.1 (nor under the option for non-EU participants in the declaration of honour (DoH) to be
signed before grant signature), since they do NOT count as participants from non-EU
countries.
Formally speaking, place of establishment of international organisations is irrelevant and for
the purposes of the Grant Agreement they are considered as neither EU nor non-EU entities.
They have a special status (supra-national)and are covered specifically by the provisions of
Article 10.2.
If an international organisation is pillar-assessed, the provisions of Article 10.3 apply in
addition.

General > Article 10.2 International Organisations
10.2 Participants which are international organisations
10.2 Participants which are international organisations
[OPTION 1 for programmes without international organisations: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with international organisations (standard): Participants which are international
organisations (IOs; if any) undertake to comply with their obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical principles,
environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information, intellectual property rights,
visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use either independent public officers or
external auditors which comply with comparable standards as those set out in EU Directive
2006/43/EC35
- for the controls under Article 25: to allow for the checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the
bodies mentioned in that Article, taking into account the specific agreements concluded by them
and the EU (if any).
For such participants, nothing in the Agreement will be interpreted as a waiver of their privileges or
immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or international law.
Special rules on applicable law and dispute settlement apply (see Article 43 and Data Sheet, Point 5).]
35 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and
consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. International organisations (IOs)
International organisations are not a separate category of participants, but simply
participants (e.g. beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner, subcontractor) with a
specific legal form and status under international public law and validated as such in the
Participant Register.
Examples: International organisations are for example UN organisations and specialised
agencies (e.g. WHO, UNHCR, UNEP, UNESCO), ESA, ECMWF, OCCAR.
They can usually participate in EU funding programmes, unless the programme explicitly
provides otherwise (e.g. in HE, international European research organisations (IEROs) can
always participate with funding, while other international organisations can participate with
funding only under certain circumstances set out in the work programme/call conditions).
Since international organisations are normally not subject to EU law, the Grant Agreement
recalls the most important principles and obligations regarding audits and controls and makes
them contractually binding.
In addition, Article 10.2 acknowledges that nothing in the Grant Agreement will be
interpreted as a waiver of the privileges and immunities set out in their constituent
documents and recognized under international law.
Thus, for instance,:
− enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU or decisions on administrative sanctions
(i.e. exclusion or financial penalties; see Articles 22 and 34) will normally not be
directed at international organisations
169EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− international organisations agree with the granting authority on the applicable law that
should apply to the Grant Agreement (including no applicable law; see Article 43.1).
− dispute settlement is normally not brought before national or EU courts but referred to
the Permanent Court of Arbitration (see Article 43.2).
Additional specific rules apply moreover if the international organisation is also pillar-
assessed (see Article 10.3).

General > Article 10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
[OPTION 1 for programmes without pillar-assessed entities: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with pillar-assessed entities: Pillar-assessed participants (if any) may rely on
their own systems, rules and procedures, in so far as they have been positively assessed and do not call into
question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and procedures which
participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control system, accounting system, external
audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and exclusion, information on recipients and protection of
personal data; see Article 157 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in
particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards, rules and
procedures
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in accordance with usual
accounting practices
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, pre-financing guarantees are not needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their regular internal
or external auditors and in accordance with their internal financial regulations and
procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if those practices
are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no recovery if
the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue amounts from the third party
receiving the support (including legal proceedings) and non-recovery is not due to an error or
negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be conducted taking into
account the rules and procedures specifically agreed between them and the framework
agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the participant’s internal
rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment will be
calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for execution only after
termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into before the pre-information letter was
received and could not reasonably be terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated for damage it
sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not
implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the damage is due to an
infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures or due to a violation of third
parties’ rights by the participant or one of its employees or individual for whom the employees
are responsible.
171EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do purchases,
subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance with their internal rules and
procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal standards, rules
and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of equal treatment of
applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use), communication,
dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- specific rules for carrying out the action (Article 18)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems, rules and
procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules and procedures
that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU, may moreover —
under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach
the principle of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries) — rely on provisions set out in that framework
agreement. ]
1. Pillar-assessed entities
Pillar-assessed entities are not a separate category of participants not a separate category of
participants, but simply participants (e.g. beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner)
that are also ‘pillar-assessed’.
Article 10.3 applies only to entities with a positive pillar-assessment. Entities with
ongoing pillar-assessment procedures must apply the standard rules under the Grant
Agreement until they fulfil the requirements to benefit from the special status provided for
in Article 10.3 (i.e. having a positive pillar assessment).
The special provisions in Article 10 may apply cumulatively for entities with multiple
statuses. Thus if an international organisation participates in a consortium and is also pillar-
assessed, both Article 10.2 and 10.3 will apply.
172EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The ‘pillar assessment’ is a special ex-ante assessment of the rules, systems and procedures
used for managing funds in accordance with Article 157 of the EU Financial Regulation
2024/250928. It provides the granting authority with assurance that the entity can offer a
similar level of protection of the budget as the Commission when it manages EU funds.
Since the pillar assessment ensures that the granting authority can rely on the systems, rules
and procedures of such entities, they can rely on those systems, rules and procedures also
for the grant, provided that:
− the systems, rules and procedures used have actually been positively assessed
Example: An entity has been pillar-assessed but the auditors had material findings regarding
the internal audit capacity leading to a negative internal control pillar result. In this case, the
granting authority cannot rely on the entity’s own rules in this respect and the entity cannot use
its own internal auditors to draw up the CFS for the activities under the Grant Agreement.
− the application of own systems, rules and procedures does not call into question the
decision awarding the grant and does not lead to a breach of the principle of equal
treatment.
Thus, if pillar-assessed entities apply in a call for proposals they must comply with all the call
conditions (IPR protection, security, ethics, etc) and the provisions of the Grant Agreement
(rules on electronic management and communication, reporting and monitoring, payment
arrangements, etc), even if these might not be in line with their internal practice (pillar-
assessed or not). The rules of the pillar-assessed entity can therefore only be used, if they do
not contradict the conditions set out in the call or the Grant Agreement.
Examples:
1. Financial support to third parties (FSTP): A beneficiary has been positively assessed for the
grants pillar. Normally, it could therefore rely on its own rules and procedures when giving FSTP in
the form of grants. However, if the call conditions stipulate specific criteria for the provision of
FSTP (e.g. because these are necessary to achieve the objectives of the call) then the pillar-
assessed entity has to follow the criteria provided for in the call, irrespective of its own positively-
assessed practices. The application of other rules would call into question the award decision since
the FSTP would not comply with the conditions of the call.
2. Subcontracting: A beneficiary has been positively assessed for the procurement pillar.
Normally, it could therefore rely on its own rules and procedures for e.g. subcontracting. However,
if the call conditions stipulate specific security provisions for subcontracting to protect the EU
security interests (e.g. the exclusion of contractors not established in EU Member States) then the
pillar-assessed entity has to follow the criteria provided for in the call irrespective of its own
positively-assessed practices, its own membership etc. The application of other rules would put the
EU security interests at risk and would thus call into question the award decision.
If the pillar assessment resulted in findings that require remedial measures (i.e. ‘supervisory
measures’ in the meaning of Article 157(3) EU Financial Regulation 2024/250929) for certain
pillars, the pillar-assessed entity must apply these remedial measures, mutatis mutandis,
also for the grant (if it would like to rely on its own systems, rules and procedures).
Example: A pillar-assessed entity is a beneficiary in a Grant Agreement that requires the provision
of financial support to third parties (FSTP) in the form of grants and the subsequent publication of
recipient information. The entity has been positively assessed in the grants pillar; however, the
auditors had findings in the publication pillar. If the Commission therefore imposes supervisory
measures requiring the pillar-assessed entity to publish regularly all grant recipients that profit
from EU funds on the entity’s website, the pillar-assessed entity will have to follow this measure
also for the financial support to third parties given under the Grant Agreement, if it intends to rely
on its own systems, rules and procedures.

29 [old Financial Regulation: Article 154(3) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
173EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The application of remedial/supervisory measures for failed pillars should not lead to a
situation where the pillar-assessed entity is subject to stricter rules than other participants,
i.e. obligations that go beyond the requirements set out in the Grant Agreement. In this case
the pillar-assessed entity can choose to apply the grant rules instead of the agreed
remedial/supervisory measures.
The granting authority must be immediately informed of any change to the systems, rules
and procedures. If the pillar-assessed entity relies on systems, rules and procedures that
have not been positively assessed, the costs and contributions may be rejected and the grant
reduced.
Specific rules apply in particular with respect to cases of recovery, liability, suspension and
termination owing to the specific nature of pillar-assessed entities (usually public law bodies,
international organisations etc.) and their frame of cooperation with the granting authority.
List of specific rules for pillar-assessed entities:
▪ Recovery: If a pillar-assessed entity provides financial support to third parties
(FSTP) and eventually it turns out (e.g. following a check by the pillar-assessed
entity) that the recipients have received undue amounts, the pillar-assessed entity
should try to recover the undue amounts from the recipients and can do so,
following its own positively assessed rules and procedures. These amounts would
normally be considered as ineligible costs under the Grant Agreement. However, if
despite best efforts by the pillar-assessed entity the undue amounts cannot be
recovered from the recipients, the granting authority will also not recover the
corresponding amount from the pillar-assessed entity (unless the non-recovery is
due to error or negligence on part of the pillar-assessed entity).
▪ Liability: Normally, participants have to compensate the granting authority for
damages they caused in connection to the implementation of action (see Article
33.2). However, pillar-assessed entities will not have to compensate the granting
authority for such damages if the pillar-assessed entity was in compliance with its
own positively-assessed rules and procedures and did not violate the rights of any
third parties.
▪ Suspension: Normally, if the Grant Agreement is suspended, cost incurred during
the suspension period will not be eligible. However, for pillar assessed entities
costs may be eligible even during grant suspension to ensure the resumption of
the action after the suspension and to serve payments under legal commitments
such as purchase and subcontracts which were concluded by the pillar-assessed
entity for the implementation of the action before the pillar-assessed entity was
informed of a possible suspension, provided the payment obligations under these
commitments can themselves not be temporarily stopped (e.g. suspended for the
period of the Grant Agreement suspension).
▪ Termination: Similarly, in case of Grant Agreement termination, pillar-assessed
entities may be reimbursed for (unavoidable) cost for legal commitments such as
purchase- and subcontracts which were concluded by the pillar-assessed entity for
the implementation of the action before information on a possible termination was
received, even if execution of the contracts would only take place after the
payment of the balance. As in the case of suspension, the pillar-assessed entity
has to take all reasonable effort to reduce such cost e.g. by terminating the
contracts at the earliest opportunity.

If there is an applicable framework agreement within the meaning of Article 131 EU Financial
Regulation 2024/2509 (i.e. Financial Framework Partnership Agreement (FFPA))30 concluded
between the European Commission and the pillar-assessed entity, the grant-relevant
provisions in the financial framework partnership agreement may be applied, provided they
do not fall under the list of provisions that would breach the principle of equal treatment or
call into question the decision awarding the grant , e.g. regarding audits.
Record-keeping — If a pillar-assessed entity relies on its own positively-assessed rules for
record-keeping, it must still ensure that these record-keeping rules are in line with obligations
under the Grant Agreement, e.g. record-keeping must be done in a way that allows checks,
reviews and audits (under the rules of a financial framework partnership agreement, if applicable)
and follow the rules for recording of time worked on the action for the calculation of personnel
costs.

SECTION 2 RULES FOR CARRYING OUT THE ACTION
General > Article 11 — Proper implementation of the action
ARTICLE 11 — PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION
ARTICLE 11 — PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION
11.1 Obligation to properly implement the action
The beneficiaries must implement the action as described in Annex 1 and in compliance with the provisions
of the Agreement, the call conditions and all legal obligations under applicable EU, international and national
law.
11.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Proper implementation of the action
The action must be properly implemented, i.e. implemented in accordance with the
beneficiaries’ obligations. These obligations include the obligations stemming explicitly from
the Grant Agreement but also include any other rules applicable to the activities of the
project. The obligations to properly implement the action requires:
− that the action (i.e. the work) must be carried out as described in the description of
the action (DoA; Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement)
− compliance with the provisions of the Agreement (other than those set out in the DoA;
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement)
− compliance with the call conditions as set out in all the documents accompanying the
call for proposals
AND
− compliance with all the applicable provisions of EU, international and national law.
The requirement to properly implement the action is a general obligation to implement the
grant in good faith in compliance with any applicable rules (whether specifically listed in the Grant
Agreement or not) at any step of implementation. It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to be aware
of this and apply it to their project.
The work must be done properly (good quality) and on time. Participants must prevent
delays (or reduce them as much as possible). In addition, important delays should be
immediately signalled to the granting authority (see Article 19).
When implementing the action as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of
the Grant Agreement), all work on the project must comply with the obligations set out in
other parts of the Grant Agreement, in particular the rules for carrying out the action (e.g.
data protection, confidentiality; see also Annex 5).
Example: As part of the activities set out in your description of the action, you are
subcontracting the conduct of a survey. Even though you have to ensure the proper technical
conduct of the survey as described in the action and ensure submission of the deliverable within
the time limits of the action under the terms of the grant, you also have to comply with the rules
176EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
on subcontracting, any applicable data protection rules etc. Otherwise, the granting authority
may reject cost or reduce your grant even if you provided your deliverable in good quality and on
time.
This means in practice that full compliance with all obligations at all time is expected.
Apart from obligations explicitly specified in the Grant Agreement and its Annexes, the
beneficiaries must also comply with the call conditions (e.g. conditions on geographic
eligibility, eligible participants, financial support to third parties (FSTP), specific cost eligibility
rules, etc). These conditions must be fulfilled throughout the implementation of the project.
Example: The call conditions provide that entities subject to EU restrictive measures (also called
‘sanctions’) cannot participate in the grant in any capacity, including as associated partners or
subcontractors.
The granting authorities cannot know in advance and therefore cannot specify all possible
obligations that a beneficiary may have in connection with the activities under the Grant
Agreement. Accordingly the Grant Agreement includes the general obligations to comply with
all the applicable provisions of EU, international and national law (including general
principles, such as fundamental rights, values and ethical principles).
If activities take place in several countries, the participants must comply with the national
law of the country in which they are established AND that of the country (or countries) where
the action is implemented.
Example: Each beneficiary must comply in particular with the labour law applicable to the
personnel working on the action and must fulfil the tax and social obligations related to the
activities it carries out under the applicable national law. If a part of the activities is done in
another country, the applicable rules must be respected.
This obligation also requires compliance with other legal acts and other binding or non-
binding rules and guidance in the area concerned (see definition of ‘Applicable EU,
international and national law’ in Article 2). This includes applicable professional code of
conducts, sectoral guidance, but also covers relevant legal acts such as work programmes
adopted by the granting authority or guidance provided by the granting authority.
Example: Activities in the course of the project may require the involvement of certain
professions whose work is governed by sector- or profession-specific guidelines or codes of
conducts, e.g. in healthcare. The proper implementation of the action would normally oblige the
beneficiary to comply with all such guidelines or codes of conduct in concerned areas of work
(unless the description of the action explicitly requires otherwise, e.g. to test innovative new
methods, within the boundaries of binding rules).
It also includes compliance with relevant legal acts such as the conditions set out in work
programmes adopted by the granting authority and applicable to the action, or any guidance
provided by the granting authority.
Specific cases (proper implementation):
Conflicts between applicable rules — The beneficiaries remain fully responsible to plan
and implement their action in a way that ensures the exercise of the rights by the granting
authority/other EU bodies, including for checks, reviews, audits and investigations. If conflicts
with applicable (e.g. national/third country) rules prevent the exercise of these rights (e.g.
access to records or results) the granting authority may reject costs, reduce the grant or
terminate the participation of the beneficiary (or the Grant Agreement).
Conflicts with security rules — Be aware that national/third country security requirements
(national/third country security classification, national export restrictions, etc) may affect the
project implementation (and even put it at risk). It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to avoid
this and to keep your project free of such restrictions, either by adapting the action or by
obtaining all necessary authorisations to be able to comply with your obligations under the
Grant Agreement (see also specific case above). Any potential security issues should
immediately be notified to the granting authority.
177EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: According to national rules a personnel security clearance (PSC) may be required for
accessing information even below CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL level. If this prevents the
granting authority, ECA, OLAF or EPPO from exercising their rights, the reference to conflicting
national rules will not release the beneficiary from contractual obligations and the granting
authority will take the necessary measures (e.g. rejection of cost due to lack of supporting
documents).

General > Article 12 — Conflict of interests
ARTICLE 12 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
ARTICLE 12 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
12.1 Conflict of interests
The beneficiaries must take all measures to prevent any situation where the impartial and objective
implementation of the Agreement could be compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life,
political or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect interest (‘conflict of interests’).
They must formally notify the granting authority without delay of any situation constituting or likely to lead
to a conflict of interests and immediately take all the necessary steps to rectify this situation.
The granting authority may verify that the measures taken are appropriate and may require additional
measures to be taken by a specified deadline.
12.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28)
and the grant or the beneficiary may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Conflict of interests
The beneficiaries must ensure that the action is implemented impartially and objectively, as
described in the Grant Agreement. They must do their best to take all measures to avoid
conflicts of interest. Persons working on the action should in particular:
− refrain from taking any action which may bring them into a situation of conflict of
interests
− take appropriate measures to prevent conflicts of interest from arising in the tasks
under their responsibility
− take appropriate measures to address any situations which may objectively be
perceived as a conflict of interests
AND
− report any conflict of interests, or situations that could be perceived as a conflict of
interests.
Best Practice: It is recommended that the beneficiaries have a system in place that allows (at
least) persons working on the action to declare conflicts of interests and clear rules how to
address such situations. Awareness-raising activities should be carried out regularly.
‘Conflicts of interests’ can negatively affect the action and may lead to a rejection of cost or
grant reduction, in particular if a conflict of interests affects the action’s implementation in
terms of:
− quality, e.g. if a conflict of interest leads to persons/contractors not best qualified for
the work
OR
− cost, e.g. if a conflict of interest leads to award of (sub)contract’s or purchases not
offering best value for money or lowest price.
179EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Conflicts of interests must be avoided irrespective of whether they actually affect quality or
cost, or whether the persons involved actually gain any benefit (or not).
Conflicts may be resulting from direct or indirect interests in relation to:
− family or emotional ties, while often connected, avoidance of conflict of interests
due to ‘family’ or ‘emotional life’ are separate obligations. An emotional bond between
family members is therefore not required for a person’s impartiality to be
compromised by reasons involving family, e.g. subcontracts with business owned by
family members, even if no close emotional ties exist
Examples:
Direct interest: A person works for a beneficiary who plans to subcontract a task. A company
owned by the person’s spouse may submit an offer. In this case the person working for the
beneficiary could have a direct interest in awarding the spouse’s company (and therefore would
need to declare a conflict of interest and abstain from being involved in the preparation and
award of the subcontract).
Indirect interest: A person works for a beneficiary who plans to subcontract a task. A
company may submit an offer. The person’s spouse my work for a usual supplier of that
company, or my own facilities or land that would be used by that company in case it
implements the subcontract. In this case the person working for the beneficiary could have an
indirect interest in awarding the company (and therefore would need to declare a conflict of
interest and abstain from being involved in the preparation and award of the subcontract).
− political or national affinity, this concerns situations where beneficiaries or third
parties may be chosen, or activities carried out, based on political or national
considerations (although a mere link with beliefs, views, opinions or preferences of the
person does not automatically constitute a personal interest)
Example: The CEO of a beneficiaries selects a contractor, or a site for a demonstration, not
based on objective and verifiable criteria on the merits, but instead selects a compatriot as
contractor or a demonstration site due to the political party membership of the local mayor.
− economic interests which include, but are not limited to, direct financial benefits
Examples:
1. A beneficiary or a person working for a beneficiary subcontracts work to another legal entity
because it is a shareholder in this other legal entity.
2. A professor working for a beneficiary (a university) subcontracts work to a consultancy firm
in which the professor is a partner.
3. A beneficiary agrees to award a subcontract to a company in exchange for preferential
treatment in that company’s own future contracting.
4. A person working for a beneficiary receives an offer for a subcontract from a company for
which the person has applied for a position.
− other direct and indirect interests, which can include reception of gifts or
hospitality, non-economic interests, or result from involvement with e.g. non-
governmental organisations (even if non-remunerated), resulting in competing duties
of loyalty between one entity the person owes a duty to and another person or entity
the person owes a duty.
Examples:
1. To discuss its proposed offer, a potential subcontractor has invited staff of the beneficiary to
its premises, including hotel accommodation, dinner and gifts.
2. A person involved in subcontracting of a beneficiary is also holding an office in a local NGO.
The President of the NGO owns a company that may become the subcontractor.
If there is a (risk of) a conflict of interests, the coordinator must inform the granting
authority so that steps can be agreed to resolve the situation and avoid cost rejection or
reduction of the grant.
180EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This may result in the requirement by the granting authority to put in place certain
measures, in particular for persons with a perceivable risk of conflict of interest to withdraw
from any decision-making that could affect their direct or indirect interest.

General > Article 13 — Confidentiality and security
ARTICLE 13 — CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
ARTICLE 13 — CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
13.1 Sensitive information
The parties must keep confidential any data, documents or other material (in any form) that is identified as
sensitive in writing (‘sensitive information’) — during the implementation of the action and for at least until
the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6).
If a beneficiary requests, the granting authority may agree to keep such information confidential for a longer
period.
Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, they may use sensitive information only to implement the
Agreement.
The beneficiaries may disclose sensitive information to their personnel or other participants involved in the
action only if they:
(a) need to know it in order to implement the Agreement and
(b) are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
The granting authority may disclose sensitive information to its staff and to other EU institutions and bodies.
It may moreover disclose sensitive information to third parties, if:
(a) this is necessary to implement the Agreement or safeguard the EU financial interests and
(b) the recipients of the information are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
The confidentiality obligations no longer apply if:
(a) the disclosing party agrees to release the other party
(b) the information becomes publicly available, without breaching any confidentiality obligation
(c) the disclosure of the sensitive information is required by EU, international or national law.
Specific confidentiality rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
13.2 Classified information
The parties must handle classified information in accordance with the applicable EU, international or national
law on classified information (in particular, Decision 2015/444 and its implementing rules).
Deliverables which contain classified information must be submitted according to special procedures agreed
with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted only after explicit approval (in writing)
from the granting authority.
Classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants involved in the action
implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the granting authority.
Specific security rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
13.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.

If the project involves, uses or generates information that should not be made public (e.g.
commercially sensitive information, business or trade secrets, confidential market data,
valuable results not yet protected by intellectual property rights, security-sensitive
information, etc), it should be identified and handled as ‘sensitive’ in accordance with the
provisions in Article 13.1 (and Annex 5, if the Grant Agreement sets out specific rules for the
programme, e.g. HE).
For actions raising specific concerns, such as security or public order (e.g. involving
strategic assets), beneficiaries may have to comply with additional obligations before and
after the grant award. For example, in some programmes (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF), actions
linked to security concerns may have to undergo a security review before selection and may
be made subject to specific security recommendations in Annex 1.
Sensitive information (former ‘confidential’; new for 2021-2027) must be kept confidential —
during the action and for at least five years afterwards (see Data Sheet, Point 6) — meaning
that they may be disclosed only within the strict limits of what is allowed under Article 13, in
particular to implement the Grant Agreement or protect the EU financial interests.
The confidentiality obligation is a minimum obligation: Beneficiaries may extend the period
and agree to additional confidentiality-related obligations among themselves (for example,
for access for other participants). Moreover, they may ask the granting authority to extend
the period. This request must explain why and clearly identify the sensitive information
concerned.
Best practice: In order to avoid issues, it is recommended that beneficiaries inform each
other and the granting authority in case they know about laws that would require disclosing
sensitive information. This can allow to work together to minimise any negative effects.
2. EU-classified information
If the project uses or generates information that is (or must be) classified, additional rules
and procedures will apply in line with Article 13.2 (and Annex 5, if the Grant Agreement sets
out specific rules for the programme).
These are in particular:
− security rules for protecting EU classified information set out in Decision No
2015/44431 and its implementing rules on classified grants32 and programme security
instruction (PSI), if any (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF,) and
− national rules on the protection of classified information.
31 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p.53).
32 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2021/259 of 10 February 2021 laying down implementing rules on
industrial security with regard to classified grants (OJ L 58, 19.2.2021, p. 55).
183EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In addition, security of information agreements concluded by the EU with third countries or
international organisations may also be indirectly relevant (for instance, may be a pre-
condition for awarding (or not) the grant by the granting authority), but they do not impose
any direct obligations for on the consortium (do not directly apply to them).
Projects expected to involve EU classified information (EUCI) will have to undergo a security
review procedure before selection, to set EU classification levels and other security
recommendations (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF).
Example: Some of the information produced by a project could potentially be used to plan
terrorist attacks or avoid detection of criminal activities.
For more guidance on classification of information and security obligations, see How to handle
security-sensitive projects, Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe
projects and Guidelines on the classification of information in Digital Europe projects.
3. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional rules may be set out in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF
CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM, EDF).

General > Article 14 — Ethics and values
ARTICLE 14 — ETHICS AND VALUES
ARTICLE 14 — ETHICS AND VALUES
14.1 Ethics
The action must be carried out in line with the highest ethical standards and the applicable EU, international
and national law on ethical principles.
Specific ethics rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
14.2 Values
The beneficiaries must commit to and ensure the respect of basic EU values (such as respect for human
dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities).
Specific rules on values (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
14.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Ethics
The action must ensure ethics compliance, this obligation is twofold:
− the action is in line with the highest ethical standards and
− the action ensures compliance with applicable international, EU and national law.
Main ethical principles:
▪ Respecting human dignity and integrity
▪ Ensuring honesty and transparency and notably getting free and informed consent
(as well as assent whenever relevant)
▪ Protecting vulnerable persons
▪ Ensuring privacy and confidentiality
▪ Promoting justice and inclusiveness
▪ Minimising harm and maximising benefit
▪ Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially in developing
countries
▪ Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction and
refinement in animal research
▪ Respecting and protecting the environment and present/future generations
The key sources of EU and international law are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols (for
other texts). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (UN CRPD).
Activities exposed to ethics risks usually run an ethics review as part of their grant selection
procedures (HE, DEP and EDF). Other programmes may perform manual checks.
185EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For more guidance, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment (can be used for all
programmes and especially for HE, DEP and EDF).
2. Values
All EU policies and programmes must respect the values on which the EU is founded and
which are set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Furthermore, the EU
institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the Member States, when implementing
EU law, must respect the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights
of the European Union.
Based on Article 14.2, during the implementation of the action, the beneficiaries must commit
to and ensure the respect of EU values.
EU values:
▪ respect for human dignity
▪ freedom
▪ democracy
▪ equality, including equality between women and men, non-discrimination
▪ rule of law
▪ respect for human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities
▪ pluralism, tolerance, justice, solidarity.
Accordingly, there can be no discrimination based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin,
genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a
national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation during the
implementation of the action or work programme.
3. Breaches of ethics or EU values
Breaches of ethics or EU values under this Article may lead to grant reductions (see Article
28) or other measures described in Chapter 5, such as rejection of costs or contributions,
payment deadline suspension, payment suspension, GA suspension, beneficiary or GA
termination, damages and administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures
and/or financial penalties).
Be aware that these measures may be taken not only when the beneficiary itself
breached the EU values, also when other persons and entities, such as its affiliated entities,
associated partners, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)
(see Articles 8, 9.1, 9.3 and 9.4) OR persons having powers of representation, decision-
making or control, or persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant breach
them (see Article 32).
Examples: Termination of a beneficiary because a person having powers of representation for the
beneficiary makes a public statement which discriminates against religion or belief.
4. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional rules may be set out in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF
EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, EDF, EU4H, Euratom, RELEX).

General > Article 15 — Data protection
ARTICLE 15 — DATA PROTECTION
15.1 Data processing by the granting authority
ARTICLE 15 — DATA PROTECTION
15.1 Data processing by the granting authority
Any personal data under the Agreement will be processed under the responsibility of the data controller of
the granting authority in accordance with and for the purposes set out in the Portal Privacy Statement.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission, an EU regulatory or executive agency,
joint undertaking or other EU body, the processing will be subject to Regulation 2018/172538.
38 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data,
and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).
1. Processing of personal data (by the EU)
The granting authority will process personal data in compliance with Regulation 2018/172533
and as set out in the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy Statement.
When the granting authority collects and processes personal data under the Grant
Agreement, national data protection law is NOT applicable and will NOT be accepted as a
justification for not complying with obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Personal data will be processed only for the purpose of implementing, managing and
monitoring the grant implementation/compliance with the provisions under the Grant
Agreement or protecting EU financial interests (including controls on eligibility of costs,
proper implementation of the action and compliance with other obligations).
The level of detail of the data requested will depend on the process and situation and will be
limited to what is necessary (data minimisation).
The processing of personal data under the Grant Agreement (manual or electronic) is notified
(by the data controller) to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) of the European Commission. In
addition, for processing that implies specific risks to the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects (e.g. processing of data relating to health), the European Data Protection Supervisor
(EDPS) will be consulted.
The notifications are available via the Register of the DPO1 (and describe the processing
operations, legal basis, security safeguards, retention period, possible data transfer, etc).
33 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and
agencies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).
187EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Right to access and correct personal data
Persons whose data is being processed (data subjects) can contact the data controller or the
DPO (via the contact information in the Privacy Statement), to:
− correct errors in the data, block access or delete their data
− complain about the data collection and use, and claim compensation for any damage.
3. Complaints to the EDPS
Persons whose data is being processed (data subjects) can also lodge a complaint with the
European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) (i.e. the independent supervisory authority for
data processing by EU institutions).
Best practice: Please contact first contact the data controller (see above) to clarify concerns
or solve problems regarding your data.
188EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
15.2 Data processing by the beneficiaries
15.2 Data processing by the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must process personal data under the Agreement in compliance with the applicable EU,
international and national law on data protection (in particular, Regulation 2016/67939).
They must ensure that personal data is:
- processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subjects
- collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is
incompatible with those purposes
- adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed
- accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
- kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
purposes for which the data is processed and
- processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the data.
The beneficiaries may grant their personnel access to personal data only if it is strictly necessary for
implementing, managing and monitoring the Agreement. The beneficiaries must ensure that the personnel is
under a confidentiality obligation.
The beneficiaries must inform the persons whose data are transferred to the granting authority and provide
them with the Portal Privacy Statement.
15.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
39 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (‘GDPR’) (OJ L 119,
4.5.2016, p. 1).
1. Processing of personal data (by the Consortium)
During the implementation of the action, the beneficiaries will collect and process personal
data, e.g. of their own staff, staff of other participants, and may also share such data with
the granting authority. In all such instances, the personal data must be processed in line with
the provisions under the Grant Agreement, in particular in compliance with applicable EU and
national law on data protection (in particular, with the General Data Protection Regulation
2016/67934 (GDPR)).
34 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and
repealing Directive 95/46/EC (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).
189EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The data protection obligations (e.g. to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully,
fairly and in a transparent manner) are a contractual obligation under the Grant Agreement
and apply to all beneficiaries, irrespective of whether the GDPR is directly applicable to them
or whether applicable national law provides for such requirements (or not).
According to those rules, personal data must be processed according to certain principles and
conditions (see EDPB data protection guide for small business).
‘Personal data’ means any information, private or professional, which relates to an identified
or identifiable natural person (for the full definition, see Article 4(1) GDPR).
− name, surname, phone numbers (e.g. staff)
− identification numbers, such as an individual’s client number, an individual’s employee
number
− a booking reference
− email addresses, location data
− photos, videos and audio recordings containing images or sounds of individuals.
Processing of special categories of data is in principle prohibited, except in the specific
circumstances set out in Article 9(2) GDPR.
Data that reveals information about health, sex life or sexual orientation, racial or ethnic
origin political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, biometric and genetic data or trade
union membership (so-called ‘sensitive data’) is subject to specific rules for the processing, in
order to protect it more.
‘Processing’ means any operation (or set of operations) which is performed on personal data,
either manually or by automatic means. This includes:
− − collection
− − recording
− − organisation
− - structuring
− - storage
− - adaptation or alteration
− − retrieval and consultation
− − use
− − disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available
− − alignment or combination
− − restriction, erasure or destruction.
190EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Examples (processing of personal data): creating a mailing list or a list of participants;
managing a database; accounting records on personnel costs; time-sheets; project planning with
names
Personal data must be processed according to certain principles and conditions that aim to
ensure both data quality and confidentiality35.
The beneficiaries must give their staff access to personal data on a need to know basis, for
carrying out their tasks/functions under the Grant Agreement. This means that the
beneficiaries must put in place adequate access controls and retention policies for the various
categories of data they hold.
The beneficiaries must inform persons (including their staff whose personal data are collected
and processed) about the disclosure of their data to the granting authority by providing them
with the Privacy Statement.
Examples:
1. Before encoding staff data in the Participant Register or into a proposal, the beneficiary must
provide the staff concerned with the privacy statement.
2. If in an ex-post audit, the Granting Authority requests the names, CVs, time-sheets and salaries
of the beneficiary’s staff (to check the eligibility of personnel costs), the beneficiary must inform
the staff concerned and provide them with the privacy statement.
The beneficiaries must ensure for all their data collection and processing a valid legal basis
(see EDPB data protection guide for small business > Process personal data lawfully). Special
attention is required were personal data is transferred to third countries (see EDPB data
protection guide for small business > International data transfers).
Specific cases (data protection):
International organisations (IOs) — The application of the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) is without prejudice to the provisions of international law, such as the
ones governing the privileges and immunities of international organisations (see Articles
10.2). The international organisations are subject to their own data protection internal rules /
regulatory frameworks. At the same time, any controller or processor that falls within the
scope of the GDPR for a given processing activity, and that exchanges personal data with
international organisations, has to comply with the GDPR rules on transfers to international
organisations. Agreements can build on elements already existing in the data protection
internal rules / regulatory framework of the international organisation.
Pillar-assessed participants — Entities that are pillar-assessed may rely on their own
positively assessed systems, rules and procedures for data protection (see Articles 10.3).
Easy to understand guidance on principles and compliance with data protection is for example
provided by the European Data Protection Board in the EDPB data protection guide for small
business.

ARTICLE 16 — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) — BACKGROUND AND
RESULTS — ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE
ARTICLE 16 — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) — BACKGROUND AND
RESULTS —ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE
16.1 Background and access rights to background
The beneficiaries must give each other and the other participants access to the background identified as
needed for implementing the action, subject to any specific rules in Annex 5.
‘Background’ means any data, know-how or information — whatever its form or nature (tangible or
intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that is:
(a) held by the beneficiaries before they acceded to the Agreement and
(b) needed to implement the action or exploit the results.
If background is subject to rights of a third party, the beneficiary concerned must ensure that it is able to
comply with its obligations under the Agreement.
16.2 Ownership of results
The granting authority does not obtain ownership of the results produced under the action.
‘Results’ means any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as data, know-how or information,
whatever its form or nature, whether or not it can be protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including
intellectual property rights.
16.3 Rights of use of the granting authority on materials, documents and information received for
policy, information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes
The granting authority has the right to use non-sensitive information relating to the action and materials and
documents received from the beneficiaries (notably summaries for publication, deliverables, as well as any
other material, such as pictures or audio-visual material, in paper or electronic form) for policy information,
communication, dissemination and publicity purposes — during the action or afterwards.
The right to use the beneficiaries’ materials, documents and information is granted in the form of a royalty-
free, non-exclusive and irrevocable licence, which includes the following rights:
(a) use for its own purposes (in particular, making them available to persons working for the granting
authority or any other EU service (including institutions, bodies, offices, agencies, etc.) or EU
Member State institution or body; copying or reproducing them in whole or in part, in unlimited
numbers; and communication through press information services)
(b) distribution to the public (in particular, publication as hard copies and in electronic or digital
format, publication on the internet, as a downloadable or non-downloadable file, broadcasting by any
channel, public display or presentation, communicating through press information services, or
inclusion in widely accessible databases or indexes)
(c) editing or redrafting (including shortening, summarising, inserting other elements (e.g. meta-data,
legends, other graphic, visual, audio or text elements), extracting parts (e.g. audio or video files),
dividing into parts, use in a compilation)
(d) translation
(e) storage in paper, electronic or other form
(f) archiving, in line with applicable document-management rules
192EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(g) the right to authorise third parties to act on its behalf or sub-license to third parties the modes of use
set out in Points (b), (c), (d) and (f), if needed for the information, communication and publicity
activity of the granting authority and
(h) processing, analysing, aggregating the materials, documents and information received and
producing derivative works.
The rights of use are granted for the whole duration of the industrial or intellectual property rights concerned.
If materials or documents are subject to moral rights or third party rights (including intellectual property
rights or rights of natural persons on their image and voice), the beneficiaries must ensure that they comply
with their obligations under this Agreement (in particular, by obtaining the necessary licences and
authorisations from the rights holders concerned).
Where applicable, the granting authority will insert the following information:
“© – [year] – [name of the copyright owner]. All rights reserved. Licensed to the [name of granting authority] under conditions.”
16.4 Specific rules on IPR, results and background
Specific rules regarding intellectual property rights, results and background (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
16.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such a breach may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Background and access rights to background
In order to ensure a successful project, the participants must give each other mutual access
to background that is necessary for the project implementation (and thus get an overview of
the relevant background and identify if it is needed for the action).
Specific (or different) conditions and additional rules on access to background are
provided for some programmes in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF).
‘Background’ means any tangible or intangible input — from data to know-how, information
or rights — that exists before the grant is signed and that is needed to implement the action
or to exploit its results (e.g. database rights, patents, prototypes, cell lines, etc).
Background is not limited to input owned, but potentially extends to anything the
beneficiaries lawfully hold (e.g. through a licence with the right to sub-licence). If a
beneficiary is a legal person, it also extends to input held by other parts of the beneficiary’s
organisation.
For registered intellectual property rights (‘Intellectual property’ being understood in the
meaning defined in Article 2 of the Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property
Organisation36), it suffices that the application was filed before the grant is signed.
36 Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organisation, signed in Stockholm on 14 July 1967.
Available at http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/convention/trtdocs_wo029.html.
193EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If access to background is subject to restrictions due to the rights of third parties, the
beneficiary should inform the other beneficiaries — before signing the grant — to ensure that
the beneficiaries are still able to comply with their grant obligations.
Example: A beneficiary holding background is by a pre-existing agreement (e.g. licence
agreement) restricted in the access it can grant to such background. The beneficiaries may agree to
exclude the background. Such an exclusion may be temporary (e.g. to permit the adequate
protection of the background before providing access) or limited (e.g. to exclude only one or more
specific beneficiaries). But since background is by definition considered to be needed for the
implementation or exploitation, the impact of such an exclusion on the (especially if not temporary)
should be carefully examined by the beneficiaries.
Best practice: Although not obligatory, beneficiaries are advised to agree in writing on
background before the grant is signed, to ensure that they have access rights to what is
needed for implementing the action, including exploiting its results. The agreement may take
any form (e.g. positive list, negative list). It may be a separate agreement or may be part of
the consortium agreement. If after grant signature beneficiaries come to hold useful inputs
relevant to implement the action, they should endeavour to come to an agreement how such
inputs can be used in the action.
2. Ownership of results
Results belong to the beneficiary(ies) that generated them. The granting authority does not
obtain ownership of the results produced under the action.
‘Results’ include the action’s tangible effects (e.g. data, prototypes, microorganisms),
intangible effects (e.g. know-how, formulas), as well as any attached rights (e.g. patent
rights and database rights). Results do not include the effects generated/produced by
activities outside of the project — be it before the action starts, during its course or after it
ends.
Best practice: To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, beneficiaries should keep documents
such as laboratory notebooks to show how and when they produced the results.
3. Rights of use of the granting authority for communication, dissemination and
publicity purposes
The granting authority may use (free of charge) any non-sensitive information relating to the
action and materials and documents received from the beneficiaries for policy, information,
communication, dissemination and publicity purposes — during the action or afterwards.
Examples (materials): Summaries for publication (submitted as part of the reports), public
deliverables and any other material provided by beneficiaries, such as pictures or audio-visual
material.
Examples (communication activities): Using a picture or the publishable summary included in
the final report submitted by the action to write a story about successful actions for a Commission
publication, or for speeches, etc.
Examples (publicising activities): Providing on a granting authority website information about
the action such as its name, a project summary, the participating partners, the EU funding, etc.
The right to use the beneficiaries’ materials, documents and information is granted in the
form of a royalty-free, non-exclusive and irrevocable licence, for the whole duration of the
industrial or intellectual property rights concerned
Beneficiaries may ask the granting authority to include a copyright notice (e.g. by including
such a notice in the material).
The beneficiaries must ensure that granting authority the can use the documents or materials
by making arrangements with any third parties that could claim rights to them.
If the granting authority needs to edit or redraft the material, it will be careful not to distort
any content.

General > Article 17 — Communication and visibility
ARTICLE 17 — COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY
ARTICLE 17 — COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY
17.1 Communication — Dissemination — Promoting the action
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, the beneficiaries must promote the action and its results
by providing targeted information to multiple audiences (including the media and the public), in accordance
with Annex 1 and in a strategic, coherent and effective manner.
Before engaging in a communication or dissemination activity expected to have a major media impact, the
beneficiaries must inform the granting authority.
17.2 Visibility — European flag and funding statement
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, communication activities of the beneficiaries related to
the action (including media relations, conferences, seminars, information material, such as brochures,
leaflets, posters, presentations, etc., in electronic form, via traditional or social media, etc.), dissemination
activities and any infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, supplies or major result funded by the grant must
acknowledge the EU support and display the European flag (emblem) and funding statement (translated into
local languages, where appropriate):
The emblem must remain distinct and separate and cannot be modified by adding other visual marks, brands
or text.
Apart from the emblem, no other visual identity or logo may be used to highlight the EU support.
When displayed in association with other logos (e.g. of beneficiaries or sponsors), the emblem must be
displayed at least as prominently and visibly as the other logos.
For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the emblem without first
obtaining approval from the granting authority. This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.
Moreover, they may not appropriate the emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration or by
any other means.
196EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
17.3 Quality of information — Disclaimer
Any communication or dissemination activity related to the action must use factually accurate information.
Moreover, it must indicate the following disclaimer (translated into local languages where appropriate):
“Funded by the European Union. Views and opinions expressed are however those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily
reflect those of the European Union or [name of the granting authority]. Neither the European Union nor the granting authority can
be held responsible for them.”
17.4 Specific communication, dissemination and visibility rules
Specific communication, dissemination and visibility rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
17.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Communication, dissemination and promoting the action
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, the beneficiaries must promote the
action through communication and dissemination activities, by providing targeted information
to multiple audiences (including the media and the public), in a strategic and effective
manner and possibly engaging in a two-way exchange.
Security obligations — Respect of other obligations under the Grant Agreement may
limit in some cases the possibility to communicate about the action or disseminate (all of) its
results (e.g. security related obligations such as in case of grants involving classified
information; see Article 13).
The same may also be the case only temporarily, i.e. no communication until other
obligations under the Grant Agreement are fulfilled (e.g. until certain results are protected).
The beneficiaries are in principle free to choose the type of activities, but they should comply
with the principles below and in line with Annex 1.
Examples: A press release at the start of the action; an interview in the local radio station after
a major achievement of the action; organising workshops about the action; an event in a
shopping mall that shows how the outcomes of the action are relevant to our everyday lives;
producing a brochure to explain the action’s work to schools or university students.
The activities must be:
− effective (suited to achieving the action’s communication and dissemination goals) and
be proportionate to the scale of the action (activities carried out by a large-scale
action with beneficiaries coming from several different countries and a large budget
must be more ambitious than smaller actions)
− strategic (ad hoc efforts are NOT sufficient)
− coherent (avoid contradictory messages).
Moreover, the activities must address multiple audiences (beyond the action’s own
community), including the media and the public, in a way that can be understood by non-
specialists. They should highlight the action’s goals, results and include the public policy
perspective sought, e.g. by addressing aspects such as:
197EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− contribution to competitiveness and to solving societal challenges
− impact on everyday lives (e.g. creation of jobs, development of new technologies,
better quality products, more convenience, improved life-style, etc)
− actual or likely exploitation of the results by policy-makers, industry and other
communities
− transnational cooperation in a European consortium (i.e. how working together has
allowed to achieve more than otherwise possible).
The granting authority must be informed beforehand about any activity that is expected to
have a major media impact (media coverage in online and printed press, broadcast media,
social media, etc) that will go beyond having a local impact and which has the potential for
national and international outreach).
For more guidance and communication best practices, see Communicating about your EU-
funded project, EU communication network indicators, and the HE Social Media Guide.

statements (including downloadable pictures), see Guidelines on the use of the EU emblem in the
context of EU programmes 2021-2027.
2. Quality of information
Any communication or dissemination activity related to the action must use factually accurate
information. Should it later appear that certain information was not factually accurate (e.g.
new results obtained in a project disprove earlier information given about preliminary
results), the beneficiaries must take any appropriate and immediate steps to correct the
wrong information.
3. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional (or different) rules may be set out in Annex 5.

1. Specific rules for carrying out the action
For all EU programmes, specific rules for carrying out the action are set out in Annex 5.
These rules set out additional obligations that must be respected by the participants when
implementing the action activities. They are usually programme-specific and address
particular policy aspects and situations.
Like all other Annex 5 provisions, they are an integral part of the Grant Agreement and an
essential part of the obligations that must be complied with, in order to properly implement
the action.

ARTICLE 19 — GENERAL INFORMATION OBLIGATIONS
General > Article 19.1 Information requests
19.1 Information requests
ARTICLE 19 — GENERAL INFORMATION OBLIGATIONS
19.1 Information requests
The beneficiaries must provide — during the action or afterwards and in accordance with Article 7 — any
information requested in order to verify eligibility of the costs or contributions declared, proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the other obligations under the Agreement.
The information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
1. Requests for information
In addition to the specific information obligations set out in other parts of the Grant
Agreement (e.g. Articles 20.1, 25.1.2, 25.1.3 and 26.1), the granting authority may request
information from the beneficiaries, to verify that they:
− properly implemented the tasks described in Annex 1
− complied with their obligations under the Grant Agreement.
The granting authority may request any type of information it needs (including personal data
in order to verify that costs declared for specific people are eligible; see Article 15). The level
of detail will depend on the purpose of the request.
It may request the information for any purpose (e.g. checks for monitoring the action or
assessing reports and requests for payment; reviews; audits; investigations; evaluation of
the action’s impact).
The granting authority may request this information at any time, either during the action or
afterwards.
Examples:
1. In an ex-post audit that starts 18 months after the balance is paid, the granting authority may
request any information it needs during the audit procedure (see Article 25).
2. The granting authority may request information from the beneficiaries in order to evaluate the
action’s impact within the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement (see Article
26).
The beneficiary concerned must provide accurate, precise and complete information, in the
format and within the deadline requested.
Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep records and other supporting documents
to prove the proper implementation of the action until the time-limit set out in the Data
Sheet (normally 5 years after final payment; see Article 20.1).
200EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Unless the Grant Agreement specifies direct communication with the other beneficiaries (e.g.
see Articles 7, 21, 25, 26, 39), the granting authority will (usually) contact the coordinator to
provide the information requested. All beneficiaries have to keep their contact information
updated in the Portal also after the end of the action, see Article 19.2.
Example: For audits after the end of the action, the granting authority will normally communicate
directly with the concerned beneficiary/affiliated entity.
All information exchanges should in principle take place through the the Portal, unless the
granting authority explicitly instructs or authorises otherwise (see Article 36).

General > Article 19.2 Participant Register update
19.2 Participant Register data updates
19.2 Participant Register data updates
The beneficiaries must keep — at all times, during the action or afterwards — their information stored in the
Portal Participant Register up to date, in particular, their name, address, legal representatives, legal form and
organisation type.
1. Information in the Participant Register
What? Each beneficiary must keep their information in the Participant Register up-to-date,
including after the end of the grant.
Updated information is required in particular during the time-limit for record-keeping set out
in the Data Sheet, e.g. for the purpose information requests for checks, reviews, audits and
investigation.
The information includes:
− name
− address
− legal representatives
− legal form (e.g. private limited liability company, public law body, S.A., S.L.)
− organisation type (e.g. SME, secondary or higher education establishment, etc.).
How? The information must be updated directly in the Portal Participant Register and will
then be available in the system.However, for important changes impacting the action
implementation, the coordinator should also be informed by the beneficiary (in writing).
More details on participant registration are explained in the Online Manual > Participant
Register.

General > Article 19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
The beneficiaries must immediately inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) of any of the
following:
(a) events which are likely to affect or delay the implementation of the action or affect the EU’s
financial interests, in particular:
(i) changes in their legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation (including
changes linked to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour signed
before grant signature)
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action information: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with linked actions: [OPTION 1 by default: linked action information: not
applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the grant: changes regarding the linked action (see
Article 3)]]
(b) circumstances affecting:
(i) the decision to award the grant or
(ii) compliance with requirements under the Agreement.
19.4 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
What? Each beneficiary must immediately inform about any event that is likely to
(significantly) affect or delay the action’s implementation or affect the EU financial interests.
Such change include in particular (but are not limited to) legal, financial, technical,
organisational or ownership changes and, if required in the Grant Agreement, changes in the
linked actions (if any).
Examples: A beneficiary is under financial stress and chooses to liquidate; a beneficiary is
acquired by or merged with another legal entity; a beneficiary plans to move its facility from a
Member State to a (non-EU) third country; the consortium implementing a linked action dissolves
and no longer cooperates, affecting the implementation of the action as described in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must also inform about any such changes concerning their affiliated entities.
How? The beneficiary concerned should normally inform the coordinator (through their usual
communication channels), who will then inform:
− the granting authority, via the Portal
− the other beneficiaries, through the usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail,
registered letters with proof of delivery, etc).
Best practice: It is recommended that these type of communications are done in writing (not
only orally).
203EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Register update — In many cases, the change may also require an update of the Participant
Register. Consult your LEAR and ask them to make the update.
2. Information about circumstances affecting the decision to award the grant or
compliance with requirements under the GA
What? Beneficiaries that become aware of circumstances (or changes thereof) that could
(potentially) affect the decision to award the grant or compliance with requirements under
the Grant Agreement must disclose them.
Relevant circumstances are those that:
− affect (or could have affected) the decision to award the grant, e.g. if the
information had been known at the time of evaluation it may have led to a different
scoring in the award criteria and may thus have affected the ranking of proposals,
and/or it would have led to rejection (e.g. due to ineligibility)
Example (eligibility): The eligibility criteria of a call require a consortium of three
beneficiaries established in Member States. During the action implementation, one of the
beneficiaries decides to relocate to a third country.
Example (award criteria): A consortium has three beneficiaries. One of them has a
laboratory with specialised equipment and personnel, including a team of internationally
renowned experts in the same field as the project. The quality of the work to be carried out by
this laboratory was taken into account by the evaluators for the scoring of the award criteria,
leading to a higher ranking of the proposal. During the action’s implementation, the beneficiary
sells the laboratory to an external company without involvement in the action, losing an
important part of the relevant expertise.
− affect (or could affect) the fulfilment of obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples (obligations):
1. Due to e.g. a merger, acquisition or contractual changes, certain intellectual property (e.g.
background identified as needed for implementing the action) becomes subject to rights of a
third party which no longer allows the beneficiary to implement the action as described in Annex
1, so the beneficiary can no longer comply with its obligations under the grant.
2. Due to a change of national legislation (e.g. security or export restrictions), the beneficiary
sees itself no longer able to provide deliverables and report on its activities in accordance with
the Grant Agreement.
Even if certain circumstances do not amount to a situation that would potentially affect the
decision to award the grant or compliance with requirements under the Grant Agreement, they may
still have to be notified under point (a) as events which are likely to affect or delay the
implementation of the action or affect the EU financial interests
How? The beneficiary concerned should normally inform the coordinator who will then inform
the granting authority and the other consortium members.
Based on the information, it is then up to the granting authority to assess whether the award
decision or the fulfilment of the obligations are actually affected and whether further
measures are required (incl. measures set out in Chapter 5).
Best practice: In case of doubt, the beneficiary should inform the granting authority (or
coordinator) for clarification.
204EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 20 — Record-keeping
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
20.1 Keeping records and supporting documents
The beneficiaries must — at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6) — keep records
and other supporting documents to prove the proper implementation of the action in line with the accepted
standards in the respective field (if any).
In addition, the beneficiaries must — for the same period — keep the following to justify the amounts
declared:
(a) for actual costs: adequate records and supporting documents to prove the costs declared (such as
contracts, subcontracts, invoices and accounting records); in addition, the beneficiaries’ usual
accounting and internal control procedures must enable direct reconciliation between the amounts
declared, the amounts recorded in their accounts and the amounts stated in the supporting documents
(b) for flat-rate costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to prove the
eligibility of the costs or contributions to which the flat-rate is applied
(c) for the following simplified costs and contributions: the beneficiaries do not need to keep specific
records on the actual costs incurred, but must keep:
(i) for unit costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to
prove the number of units declared
(ii) for lump sum costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents
to prove proper implementation of the work as described in Annex 1
(iii) for financing not linked to costs (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to
prove the achievement of the results or the fulfilment of the conditions as described in
Annex 1
(d) for unit, flat-rate and lump sum costs and contributions according to usual cost accounting practices
(if any): the beneficiaries must keep any adequate records and supporting documents to prove that
their cost accounting practices have been applied in a consistent manner, based on objective criteria,
regardless of the source of funding, and that they comply with the eligibility conditions set out in
Articles 6.1 and 6.2.
Moreover, the following is needed for specific budget categories:
(e) for personnel costs: time worked for the beneficiary under the action must be supported by
declarations signed monthly by the person and their supervisor, unless another reliable time-record
system is in place; the granting authority may accept alternative evidence supporting the time
worked for the action declared, if it considers that it offers an adequate level of assurance
(f) [OPTION 1 by default: additional record-keeping rules: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes
with additional record-keeping rules: [OPTION 1 by default: additional record-keeping rules: not
applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the call: for [insert name of budget category]: [insert specific
records/requirements]].]
The records and supporting documents must be made available upon request (see Article 19) or in the context
of checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the
Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 25), the beneficiaries must keep these records
and other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.
205EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are considered
originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The granting authority may accept non-
original documents if they offer a comparable level of assurance.
20.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions insufficiently
substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 27), and the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Records and other supporting documentation
The beneficiaries (and their affiliated entities) must keep appropriate and sufficient evidence
to prove the eligibility of all the costs declared, proper implementation of the action and
compliance with all the other obligations under the Grant Agreement. If costs are not
supported by appropriate and sufficient evidence, they will be rejected.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries that do not keep sufficient and appropriate supporting
documents will bear the full risk. The granting authority may take any measures set out in
Chapter 5, including to reject cost or reduce or terminate the grant. Systemic failure to keep
supporting documents may also lead to consequences in other EU actions (extension of audit
findings).
‘Sufficiency’ relates to the quantity of evidence; ‘appropriateness’ relates to its quality.
Evidence is considered sufficient and appropriate if it is persuasive enough to support the
facts or elements that need to be established. In the case of audits, the evidence will be
assessed by the auditors according to generally accepted audit standards.37
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.
Best practice: Where the nature of the action or participants may pose risks or difficulties for
checks, reviews, audits and investigations, the consortium may consider on procedures to
facilitate access to records, e.g. by depositing also adequate records with the coordinator, in
order to minimise the risk for cost rejections by the granting authority due to lack of access
to supporting documents.
The evidence must be correctly archived for the duration indicated in the Grant Agreement
(see Data Sheet, Point 6). In general, for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (3 years
for low-value grants up to EUR 60 000) or longer if there are ongoing procedures (audits,
investigations, litigation, etc). In this case, the evidence must be kept until ongoing
procedures end.
The rules in the Grant Agreement determine obligations under the EU action and do NOT
absolve the beneficiary from compliance with obligations under national law, e.g. national laws
requiring a longer retention period for keeping documents (or other additional measures).
37 International Standard on Auditing ISA 500 ‘Audit Evidence’.
206EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Original documents
In principle, the beneficiaries must keep original documents (i.e. documents considered as
original under national law) in the format in which they were received or created. This means
that:
− documents received or created in paper form should be kept in paper form
− documents received or created electronically should be kept in their electronic format
(hard copies of original electronic documents are NOT required).
Examples:
1. We will accept authenticated copies or digitally-signed documents, if national law accepts these
as originals.
2. We will accept digitalised copies of documents (instead of hard copies), if this is acceptable under
national law.
Exceptionally, the granting authority may accept non-original documents if they offer a
comparable level of assurance but this assessment is entirely up to the granting authority
and any beneficiary not keeping an original bears the full risk of cost rejection or grant
reduction.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should apply a consistent record-keeping policy, i.e. avoid that
non-original documents are presented only for the EU action whereas original records are
kept for other activities.
3. Records for actual costs
For actual costs, the beneficiaries must:
− keep detailed records and other supporting documents to prove the eligibility of the
costs declared
− use cost accounting practices and internal control procedures that make it possible to
verify that the amounts declared, amounts recorded in the accounts and amounts
recorded in supporting documentation match up.
The information included in the financial statements for each budget category (i.e. personnel
costs, subcontracting costs, etc) must be broken down into details and must match the
amounts recorded in the accounts and in supporting documentation.
Examples:
1. For costs declared in category A.1 Employees (or equivalent): the costs must be detailed for
each person carrying out work for the action (individual daily rate multiplied by day-equivalents
worked for the action). They must match the accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions,
annual financial statements) and supporting documentation (i.e. labour contracts, collective labour
agreements, applicable national law on taxes, labour and social security contributions, payslips,
time records, bank statements showing salary payments, etc).
2. For costs declared in category C. Purchase costs: the beneficiary must keep a breakdown of
costs declared by type (i.e. equipment cost, costs of other goods, works and services, etc). It
should be able to provide details of individual transactions for each type of cost. For depreciation, it
must be able to provide details per individual equipment used for the action. Declared costs must
match accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions, annual financial statements) and
supporting documentation (i.e. purchase orders, delivery notes, invoices, contracts, bank
statements, asset usage logbook, depreciation policy, etc).
4. Records for simplified cost and contributions, and financing not linked to cost
In contrast to actual cost, for simplified cost options (units, lump sums, flat-rates) and
financing not linked to cost, keeping of financial records on the actual cost incurred during
the action is NOT required.
207EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This does NOT however release the beneficiary from record-keeping rules under
applicable national law. The simplification relates to the EU grant-specific record-keeping
and reporting obligations.
Any financial and accounting records will not be assessed unless it is necessary for the
assessment of the implementation of the units, lump sums etc. declared, or to assess the
correctness of the methodology for beneficiaries using their usual cost accounting practices
(see below), or to assess the correctness of information provided in the proposal on which
basis a simplified cost amount was established.
− flat-rate costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and
other supporting documents to prove that the costs to which the flat-rate is applied
are eligible.
Example: For the flat-rate of indirect costs, the auditors will verify (and the beneficiaries must
be able to show) that the actual direct costs to which the flat-rate is applied are eligible.
− unit costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and other
supporting documents to prove the number of units declared.
− lump sum costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the completion of the action tasks, the achievement of
results, or the fulfilment of the conditions as described in Annex 1.
− financing not linked to costs: the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the achievement of the results or the fulfilment of the
conditions as described in Annex 1.
5. Records for unit, flat-rate, lump sum costs and contributions calculated in
accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices
For unit, flat-rate, lump sum costs and contributions declared in accordance with usual cost
accounting practices, the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and other supporting
documents to:
− show that the method used is their usual cost accounting practice (i.e. not just used
for the EU grant)
− show that the method used for the initial calculation of the unit, flat-rate, or lump sum
appropriately reflects the actual costs as recorded in the statutory accounts
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): accounting records;
financial statement extracts; labour contracts; collective labour agreements; applicable tax,
labour and social security laws; pay slips; bank statements showing salary payments;
classification of employees (based on experience, qualifications, salary, department, etc).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): accounting records; financial
statement extracts; time records (or other records) for the share of personnel costs included in
the unit costs; invoices or contracts for maintenance costs, cleaning costs, other services, etc,
showing how the actual costs are directly or indirectly included in the unit cost calculation.
Manual interventions into the accounting data (if any) must be traceable and
documented.
− verify that the unit, flat-rate, lump sum are free of ineligible cost components
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): records that show that the
daily rate does not include an indirect cost component (they should be covered by the indirect
208EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
costs category); records that show that the daily rate does not include travel costs (they should
be claimed under category C.1 Travel and subsistence).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): evidence that shows that there is
no profit/margin/mark-up included in the internally invoiced goods and services (e.g. different
rates: one for billing the activity, with mark-up, and another one for internal costing, free of any
mark-up); lists of accounts/cost centres that were excluded from the calculation of internally
invoiced goods and services — because already included in the costs claimed under another
budget categories (e.g. under personnel costs)
− assess the acceptability of budgeted and estimated elements.
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): records that show the
method for calculating the annual salary increases (e.g. consumer price index which, according
to the beneficiary’s usual remuneration policy, serves as the basis for annual salary increases).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): traceable data used to determine
the budgeted/ estimated elements; records on the nature and frequency of the updates of the
budgeted and estimated elements; etc.
It is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred during the action (per
person/good or service) — unless they are needed to document the usual cost accounting
practices.
6. Records for personnel costs — Day-equivalents worked for the action
For persons who work for the action (regardless if they are full-time or part-time employees
and/or if they work exclusively or not for the action; new for 2021-2027), the beneficiaries
may either:
− by default, sign a monthly declaration on day-equivalents worked for the action
(template)
OR
− use another paper- or computer-based reliable time recording system, to record (at
least) all the time (days/hours) worked for the action.
Best practice: It is recommended to explore the simplification potential of using monthly
declarations on days worked for the action. This limits record-keeping burden and avoids the
need for conversion of hours into day-equivalents.
Reliable time records must be dated and signed at least monthly by the person working for
the action and their supervisor.
NO rounding (up or down to the nearest half day-equivalent) for the time recording in
the monthly declarations. The rounding rule applies ONLY for the cost calculation (i.e. the
number of day-equivalents to declare and the maximum declarable day-equivalents) and for
the conversion from the total hours worked on the action into day-equivalents (in case of
time-recording systems based on hours). By contrast, it is NOT allowed to round up or down
to the nearest half day-equivalent in the monthly declaration.
Example: If a person with a standard working day of 8 hours worked 2 hours on the action during a
given month, 0,25 day-equivalents should be recorded for that month in their monthly declaration.
If the time recording system is computer-based, the signatures may be electronic (i.e. linking
the electronic identity data, e.g. a password and user name, to the electronic validation
data), with a documented and secure process for managing user rights and an auditable log
of all electronic transactions.
209EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Conversion of hours into day-equivalents: If you do not use the monthly declaration of
days, and instead record the time worked in hours, you must convert the total hours worked
into day-equivalents to calculate the personnel costs for the grant (see Article 6.2.A.1).
To convert hours into day-equivalents:
{number of hours worked by the person on the action during the reporting period
divided by
(number of hours of a day-equivalent)}
The resulting figure must be rounded up or down to the nearest half-day (e.g. 17,79 = 18
day-equivalents; 17,64 = 17,5 day-equivalents).
You have three options to determine the number of hours of a day-equivalent:
− Option 1: a day-equivalent is 8 hours
− Option 2: average working hours as per contract (or another binding document, e.g.
collective labour agreement, national labour legislation). You can NOT use this option
if the contract (or other binding document) does not allow to determine the average
number of hours that the person must work per day. By contrast, fluctuating or
variable working hours during the year are not a problem (see specific cases below).
− 2a: If the number of working hours is specified per day:
{working hours per day divided by working time factor}
Examples:
Full-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person is employed
full-time and must work 7,8 hours each working day. A day-equivalent for the
person is 7,8 hours (7,8 / 1 [working time factor]).
Part-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person is employed
50 % part-time and must work 4 hours each working day. A day-equivalent for the
person is 8 hours (4 / 0.5 [working time factor]).
− 2b: If the number of working hours is specified per week or month:
{(working hours per week [or month] divided by working time factor) divided by
working days per week [or month]}
For the calculation above, the number of ‘working days’ per week (or
month) is not the actual days worked by the person, but the standard number
of working days per week (or month) as per the beneficiary’s usual practices
(and applicable rules/laws). This is usually 5 working days per week (e.g.
Monday to Friday). The number should be the same for full-time and part-time
employees irrespective of the actual distribution of the (full or part-time)
working time over the week (or month).
Examples:
Full-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person must work
37,5 hours per week over 5 working days. A day-equivalent for the person is ((37,5
/ 1 [working time factor]) / 5 [days]) = 7,5 hours.
Part-time case (hours per week): The person is employed 50 % part-time and
the contract establishes that the person must work 18,75 hours per week
(consisting of five working days as per the beneficiary’s practice). In practice, the
person works two full days and a half each week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
morning). The number of working days to be used in the formula is 5 (NOT 2,5 or 3
actual days worked). A day-equivalent for the person is ((18.75 / 0.5 [working time
factor]) / 5 [days]) = 7,5 hours.
210EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Part-time case (hours per month): The person is employed 50 % part-time and
the contract establishes that the person must work 80 hours per month over 22
working days. A day-equivalent for the person is ((80 / 0,5 [working time factor]) /
22 [days]) = 7,3 hours.
− 2c: If the number of working hours is specified per year:
{(working hours per year divided by working time factor) divided by 215}
Example: If the collective labour agreement sets out 1612 hours of work per year
for full-time employees, the hours for the calculation must be adapted to 806 (1612
x 0,5) working hours per year for a 50% part-time employee, i.e. 806 / 0,5 / 215 =
7.5h day-equivalent.
− Option 3: If you have a usual cost accounting practice determining the standard
number of annual productive hours of a full-time employee, you may determine the
value of a day-equivalent as follows:
{(the higher between the standard number of annual productive hours of a full-time
employee and 90 % of the standard annual workable hours of a full-time employee)
divided by
215}
The chosen option must be applied consistently, i.e. using the same option at least
per group of personnel employed under similar conditions (e.g. same type of contract,
same cost-centre). You cannot apply the most favourable option for each employee
individually.
A conversion normally needs to be done only once per person per reporting period
for the purpose of reporting to the granting authority. It is not required that you keep a
parallel record system that directly converts hours into day-equivalents.
If you keep parallel time record systems, e.g. weekly time-sheets of hours and
monthly declarations of days, they must be consistent. In case of significant
discrepancies discovered e.g. during checks, reviews and audits, only the set of documents
recording the lower amount of days will be accepted.
Specific cases (conversion into day-equivalents):
Change of working hours during a reporting period — Option 2 (average working hours
as per contract) can also be used in case of work pattern changes (for instance, in case of an
amendment to the internal regulations and/or national (labour) law of the beneficiary
concerning daily working hours within the reporting period). In this case, the conversion from
hours to day equivalents must be done separately; in practice, you should perform a
separate conversion calculation for each period during which a different work pattern regime
was in effect. Then, sum the results to determine the total number of hours converted into
day-equivalents
Example: The beneficiary has decided to modify the working hours schedule effective from
01/01/2025, reducing the work day from 8 hours to 7 hours. The reporting period for the action is
from 01/01/2024 to 30/06/2025. The daily rate for each individual employee should be calculated
based on the hours worked (converted into day equivalents) during 2024 and 2025. The conversion
from hours to day equivalents should be calculated as follows:
A full-time employee of the beneficiary has recorded 800 hours in the year 2024 and 280 hours in
2025 for work on this project. To calculate the day equivalents worked for the action:
(800 hours worked in 2024 divided by the 8-hour day equivalent in 2024) plus (280 hours worked
in 2025 divided by the 7-hour day equivalent in 2025) equals 100 + 40, which totals 140 day
equivalents worked for the action.
Changes of working hours during different periods of each year (annual seasonal
fluctuation in working hours) — When the number of working hours fluctuates over the
211EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
year (e.g. 8 hours per day for all months except 7 hours per day during July and August), the
following formula must be applied:
{[(working hours per day multiplied by the number of months to which it applies) plus (working
hours per day multiplied by the number of months to which it applies)] divided by 12. The result
should then be divided by working time factor}
7. Records of affiliated entities, associated partners and other participants
In principle, each participant keeps their own records (to prove costs or proper
implementation; new for 2021-2027). In case of a check, review, audit or investigation, the
granting authority may ask the coordinator or responsible beneficiary to provide the
necessary documents.

General > Article 21 — Reporting
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
General > Article 21.1 Continuous reporting
21.1 Continuous reporting
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
21.1 Continuous reporting
The beneficiaries must report on the progress of the action (e.g. deliverables, milestones,
outputs/outcomes, critical risks, indicators, etc; if any), in the Portal Continuous Reporting tool and in
accordance with the timing and conditions it sets out (as agreed with the granting authority).
Standardised deliverables (e.g. progress reports not linked to payments, reports on cumulative expenditure,
special reports, etc; if any) must be submitted using the templates published on the Portal.
1. Continuous reporting
What? The beneficiaries must provide regular updates on the status of the action
implementation. This is the continuous reporting.
The continuous reporting may cover (non-exhaustive list):
− progress in achieving milestones, which are control points in the action that help to
chart progress (kick-off meetings, steering committees, first-draft of a survey,
prototype, etc); they may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, which
allows the next phase of the work to begin or is needed at intermediary points
− deliverables, which are additional outputs that must be produced at a given moment
during the action and submitted to the granting authority
Examples: Information, special report, a technical diagram brochure, list, a software milestone
or other building block of the action.
− response to critical risks, which are a plausible event or issue that could have a high
adverse impact on the ability of the action to achieve its objectives
− programme-specific monitoring information or indicators like those related to
publications, communications activities, IPRs, Open Data, Trainings, Gender etc. (if
required for your programme and depending on the type of action).
How & When? The deliverables (including progress reports not linked to payments, if any)
must be submitted through the Portal Continuous Reporting tool, in accordance with the
schedule set out for them. Both the schedule and templates to be used (if any) are available
through the Deliverables screen.

General > Article 21.2 Periodic reporting
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
In addition, the beneficiaries must provide reports to request payments, in accordance with the schedule and
modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2):
- for additional pre-financings (if any): an additional pre-financing report
- for interim payments (if any) and the final payment: a periodic report.
The pre-financing and periodic reports include a technical and financial part.
The technical part includes an overview of the action implementation. It must be prepared using the template
available in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool.
The financial part of the additional pre-financing report includes a statement on the use of the previous pre-
financing payment.
The financial part of the periodic report includes:
− the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all beneficiaries/affiliated entities)
− the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
− the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point
4.3).
The financial statements must detail the eligible costs and contributions for each budget category and, for
the final payment, also the revenues for the action (see Articles 6 and 22).
All eligible costs and contributions incurred should be declared, even if they exceed the amounts indicated in
the estimated budget (see Annex 2). Amounts that are not declared in the individual financial statements will
not be taken into account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statements (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the beneficiaries confirm
that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the costs and contributions declared are eligible (see Article 6)
- the costs and contributions can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting documents (see
Article 20) that will be produced upon request (see Article 19) or in the context of checks, reviews,
audits and investigations (see Article 25)
- for the final periodic report: all the revenues have been declared (if required; see Article 22).
Beneficiaries will have to submit also the financial statements of their affiliated entities (if any). In case of
recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the financial statements of their
affiliated entities.
1. Periodic reporting
What? In addition to the continuous reporting and in order to receive payments (any type;
additional pre-financings, interim and final payment), the beneficiaries (and their affiliated
entities) must submit reports for payment to document the technical (and financial)
implementation of the action. This is the periodic reporting.
214EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
These reports must be distinguished from deliverables and milestones (that are part of
Annex 1; see Article 21.1).
How & When? The reports for payment must be submitted through the Portal Periodic
Reporting tool after the end of each reporting period (including the final one; for the
schedule, see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
The coordinator must submit either an additional pre-financing report (for additional pre-
financing payment) or a periodic report (for interim and final payment).
In both cases, this report is composed of two main parts, a technical and a financial part.
The technical part aims at providing an overview of the action implementation and progress
and its content is programme-specific. It usually includes an explanation of work carried out,
overview of progress, publishable summary, key performance indicators, etc (template
available for download directly in the system)
The financial part is filled in directly online and includes:
− for additional pre-financing:
− a statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment (only supporting
document; no other financial information to be filled in)
− for interim and final payments:
− the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all
beneficiaries/affiliated entities
− the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if
required)
− the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2
and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) (template available for download directly in the
system).
The explanation of the use of resources must be consistent with the costs declared
in the financial statement (for each beneficiary/affiliated entity).
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries must keep adequate records of the documents
submitted for their affiliated entities (e.g. financial statement, CFS, etc; see Article 20).
For additional pre-financings, the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing
serves to curb the paying out of additional pre-financing, if not really needed (— either
because progress of the action is slow or the consumption of the previous pre-financing is
low). The additional pre-financing payment will be reduced, if — according to this statement
— the previous pre-financing was not fully used (see Article 22.3.1). Thus:
− if 70% or more of the previous pre-financing has been used: the additional pre-
financing is paid in full
− if less than 70% of the previous pre-financing has been used: the additional pre-
financing will be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the
percentage actually used and 70%.
For interim or final payments, each beneficiary/affiliated entity must fill out their individual
financial statement (individually), and then signed and formally submitted to the coordinator
(for beneficiaries, directly in the Portal; for affiliated entities, through their beneficiary). This
includes the coordinator, who must also submit the individual financial statement for itself.
215EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The individual financial statements (Annex 4 of the Grant Agreement) must contain all costs
that:
− were incurred by the beneficiary/affiliated entities during the reporting period and
− fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.
Best practice: Beneficiaries/affiliated entities should declare ALL their eligible costs — even if
they are above the estimated budget in Annex 2 (cost overruns). The grant will be capped at
the maximum grant amount in Annex 2, but cost overruns may turn out useful, if the
granting authority should reject some of the costs (at payment or later on).
Beneficiaries/affiliated entities may declare costs incurred during a previous reporting period,
if they were not declared before.
By contrast, once costs have been declared (closed financial statement), they should
normally no longer be changed. If a beneficiary/affiliated entity notices a mistake in a
previous financial statement (e.g. incorrect accounting information; error in the calculation;
etc), they can however make an adjustment (positive or negative) at the next reporting.
Such adjustments can be made to the financial statements for any previous reporting period.
Example: An internal audit by the beneficiary on the annual accounts finds errors in the
accounting information used to calculate the daily rate. The beneficiary can adapt the costs
declared to the EU action at the next reporting.
For affiliated entities, the financial statements must be filled out and submitted by their
beneficiary (since the affiliated entities cannot sign them in the IT system). Before
submission, the beneficiary must complete the data for the affiliated entity (based on the
information it received from the affiliated entity). The affiliated entity must ensure the
accuracy of the encoded information, but the beneficiary is ultimately responsible for
submitting the statement (see Article 21.2).
Best practice: Beneficiaries and their affiliated entities may establish practical information
exchange procedures to ensure and verify the accuracy of the financial statement data to be
submitted. For example, the beneficiary can create a PDF export from the system and send
it to the affiliated entity for confirmation.

21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
The financial statements must be drafted in euro.
[OPTION 1 for programmes with double conversion (standard):
Beneficiaries with general accounts established in a currency other than the euro must convert the costs
recorded in their accounts into euro, at the average of the daily exchange rates published in the C series of the
Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website), calculated over the corresponding reporting period.
If no daily euro exchange rate is published in the Official Journal for the currency in question, they must be

website (InforEuro), calculated over the corresponding reporting period.
Beneficiaries with general accounts in euro must convert costs incurred in another currency into euro
according to their usual accounting practices.]
[OPTION 6 for programmes with double conversion (EU or Oanda) with average/monthly/daily conversion
rates:
Beneficiaries with general accounts established in a currency other than the euro must convert the costs
recorded in their accounts into euro:
- either at the end of the corresponding reporting period:
- using the average of the daily exchange rates published either by the EU in the C series of
the Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website) or by Oanda over the
corresponding reporting period or
- if no daily euro exchange rate is published for the currency in question, using the average of
the monthly accounting exchange rates published on the European Commission website
(InforEuro) over the corresponding reporting period
- or for each month separately over the corresponding reporting period:
- using the monthly accounting exchange rate published, for that month, on the European
Commission website (InforEuro)

- using the accounting exchange rate published, for that day, either by the EU in the C series
of the Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website) or by Oanda.
Beneficiaries with general accounts in euro must convert costs incurred in another currency into euro
according to their usual accounting practices.]
1. Currency for financial statements and conversion into euro
Beneficiaries/affiliated entities must report their costs in the financial statements in euros.
The rules on conversion (of costs incurred in other currencies into euros) are as follows:
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities with accounting records in euros: conversion of
costs according to their usual accounting practices
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities with accounting records in a currency other than the
euro, the rules on conversion of costs recorded in their accounts may be one of the
following:
217EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for programmes with double conversion rule (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2; currently
all programmes):
− using the average, over the corresponding reporting period, of the daily
exchange rates published (most programmes):
− in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union
To calculate this average rate based on the daily exchange rates
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union,
the beneficiaries may use the editable charts on the ECB website.
How to calculate the rate on the ECB website:
Step 1 — Go to the ECB website.
Step 2 — Click on the chart icon [ ] for the currency.
Step 3 — Select the conversion (normally other currency vs. Euro).
Step 4 — Insert the starting date of the reporting period in the field
‘from’ and the end date of the reporting period in the field ‘to’. The
average for the period will appear above the chart.
Note that the ECB has changed their methodology for the displayed
average currency exchange rates (over any given period). Therefore,
average currency conversion rates taken from the ECB website before 13
April 2023 may not correspond to the average for the same period
displayed since April 13. Financial statements based on currency
conversions done with the ECB calculator before 13 April 2023 remain
however fully valid and will be recognised in case of checks, audits,
reviews or investigations. You do not need to make any

corresponding reporting period, using the currency converter on the
Commission website (InforEur).
− using either an average, monthly or daily rate (RELEX):
− for the average rate: calculation using the average over the reporting
period, in accordance with the same rules as above (plus possibility to
use the exchange rate published by Oanda instead of the rate published
by the EU)
− for the monthly rate: calculation for each month separately over the
reporting period, using the monthly accounting exchange rate published,
for each month, on the European Commission website (InforEuro)
− for the daily rate: calculation for each day separately over the reporting
period, using the accounting exchange rate published, for each day
either by the EU on the ECB website or by Oanda.
For cost adjustments to previous periods (‘adjustment financial statements’), the exchange
rate to be used is the one for the reporting period in which the costs adjusted were incurred.
For partial reporting periods (e.g. because a beneficiary joins the grant in the middle of a
reporting period), the exchange rate should be calculated as from the start date of joining the
grant.For eligible costs related to drafting and submitting the final reports incurred after the
action duration, the exchange rate to be used is the one for the last reporting period.

The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority
(see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
21.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a report submitted does not comply with this Article, the granting authority may suspend the payment
deadline (see Article 29) and apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the grant or the
coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Language of reports
For most programmes, the reports must be drafted in the language of the Grant
Agreement (indicated at the end of the Grant Agreement, next to the signatures of the
parties), unless the granting authority agreed differently.
For RELEX, the Data Sheet option in the Grant Agreement refers to the language(s) specified
in the call document (and this special language regime is then valid also for project reviews
and audits; see Article 25).

22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) and must be
distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to distribution of the initial pre-financing payment;
see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date when they are debited
to its account.
1. Payments to be made
The granting authority will make payments in accordance with what is set out in the Data
Sheet. This may include the following:
− pre-financing payment(s) at the beginning of the action (to provide beneficiaries
with a cash float to start working on the project).
Pre-financing will NOT be paid before the Grant Agreement is signed (even if the
starting date of the action is before).
− interim payment(s) to cover eligible costs incurred in the reporting periods (as
many interim payments as number of reporting periods, minus one which is the final
payment)
− the final payment (payment of the balance) after the end of the action.
All payments are subject to a payment deadline (i.e. number of days within which the
granting authority has to pay the consortium — after having received the payment request).
The deadline is defined in the Data Sheet.
If there are issues with the payment request or with the costs declared which make it
impossible to continue with the payment, the granting authority will suspend the deadline
(see Article 29). The granting authority can also, in specific circumstances, suspend
payments (see Article 30).
220EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
All payments (pre-financings, interim payments and final payment) may be offset against
debts of any of the beneficiaries towards the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary based on its eligible cost and contributions. If the granting authority is the
Commission or an EU executive agency, the offsetting will also be done for debts towards other
Commission services or executive agencies. This offsetting will be done automatically and is not
subject to the consent of the beneficiary concerned.
Note that in case of early termination of the action, the coordinator should normally not
become responsible for paying back amounts of prefinancing that were never received because
they were offset for the debts of another partner. If this happens, the granting authority may
agree to deviate from the Grant Agreement provisions and re-instate the recovery order towards
the initial debtor. Please contact the EU project officer in charge of your grant.
The payments are made to the coordinator’s bank account as set out in the Grant
Agreement; the beneficiaries are NOT paid individually by the granting authority.
The coordinator must distribute the amounts received to the beneficiaries. However, how and
when the payments are distributed is in principle an internal matter for the consortium.
The consortium agreement (if applicable) may set out, for instance, specific periods
for the distribution of payments or that the distribution will be carried out in
instalments (and these will not be considered ‘unjustified delays’, if the arrangements
set out in the consortium agreement are complied with).
Similarly, the consortium agreement may provide for a distribution of the funding
which is different from the contribution approved by the granting authority for each
beneficiary.
If the coordinator does NOT comply with its payment distribution obligations, this is in
principle an issue to be resolved within the consortium. However, persistent failure to
comply with obligations of the coordinator (such as distribution of payments) may lead
to any of the consequences as provided under the respective measure in Chapter 5.
The granting authority will normally not be informed of the distribution of the payments by
the coordinator, unless:
− if it specifically requests this
− in the event of recovery at the payment of the balance (see Article 22.3.4)
− if the participation of one or more beneficiary is terminated (see Article 22.3.2).

Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it turns out that the
granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts undue.
[OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: The general liability regime for
recoveries (first-line liability) is as follows: At final payment, the coordinator will be fully liable for
recoveries, even if it has not been the final recipient of the undue amounts. At beneficiary termination or after
final payment, recoveries will be made directly against the beneficiaries concerned.
Beneficiaries will be fully liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4):
- the beneficiaries will be jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of another beneficiary under
the Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority (see Data
Sheet, Point 4.4)
- affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of their beneficiaries under the Agreement
(including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
[OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: Each beneficiary’s financial
responsibility in case of recovery is in principle limited to their own debt and undue amounts of their
affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4), affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of
their beneficiaries, if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
1. Recoveries of undue amounts
If it turns out that the granting authority has paid too much — for example due to cost
rejection or grant reduction (in particular, following a check, audit, extension of audit
findings, review or OLAF investigation), it will recover the amount paid in excess.
Recovery normally takes place only at payment of the balance or afterwards. Exceptionally, it
can take place before, if a beneficiary’s participation is terminated.
The detailed calculations for all cases are described in Article 22.3.
2. Financial liability for recoveries
The financial liability for recoveries depends on the programme:
− for programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): the financial liability is as
follows:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation, but not intervene to recover this money (no debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole
amount that needs to be recovered (i.e. paid back to the granting authority)—
even if it has not been the final recipient of the concerned amount (debit note);
if the coordinator does not pay (irrespective of the reason), the granting
authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, drawing on the pre-
222EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
financing guarantee, joint and several liability of other beneficiaries or affiliated
entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see Article 22.4)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): each beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle
limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by their affiliated
entities. It is only for the contribution to the MIM that financial responsibility is
shared:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation and, if the beneficiary doesn’t pay, the granting authority may call
on the MIM to intervene and then start a recovery procedure against the
beneficiary for the account of the MIM (debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the contribution to the MIM will be used to
cover recoveries (if any); if the contribution is not sufficient, the coordinator
will be asked to pay back the amount owed (as representative of the
consortium); if the debt is not paid but the report on the distribution of
payments was provided, the granting authority will calculate the share of the
debt per beneficiary and confirm the amount to be recovered from each of
them separately (debit note); if they do not pay (irrespective of the reason),
the granting authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, joint and
several liability of affiliated entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see
Article 22.4); if the report on the distribution of payments was NOT provided,
the granting authority will enforce recovery against the coordinator (debit
note); if needed, the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and
will then continue recovery for the account of the MIM (second debit note
replacing the first)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note); no MIM intervention (new for 2021-
2027).
In addition, beneficiaries are always liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities
AND there may be specific joint and several liability regimes in case of enforced recoveries
(depending on the type of programme and Grant Agreement; see Article 22.4).
2.1Programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries, the granting authority will
recover the undue amounts:
from the coordinator if the recovery is at the final payment
from the beneficiary who owes the money (including undue amounts paid for costs declared
by its affiliated entities, if any) if the recovery is at beneficiary termination or after the final
payment.
In case of enforced recovery, i.e. when the coordinator/beneficiary does not pay the amount
owed, if the corresponding option has been activated (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4), the
granting authority may hold the beneficiaries jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of
another beneficiary under the Agreement (including late-payment interest)
recover also from the affiliated entities. The affiliated entity’s financial responsibility (for the
debt towards the granting authority) is limited to its maximum grant amount in Annex 2.For
more information on enforced recoveries see Article 22.4.
2.2. Programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries he granting authority will
recover the undue amounts from the beneficiary that owes the money (including undue
amounts paid for costs declared by its affiliated entities, if any).
223EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In case of recovery, each beneficiary’s financial responsibility is normally limited to its own
debt (which includes undue amounts paid for costs declared by its affiliated entities, if any).
If the granting authority has requested joint and several liability of an affiliated entity, it may
recover also from the affiliated entity in case of enforced recovery. The affiliated entity’s
financial responsibility (for the debt towards the granting authority) is limited to its maximum
grant amount in Annex 2.
For more information on enforced recoveries see Article 22.4.
3. Procedure
The basic procedure for recovery is almost always the same: After a contradictory
procedure, the granting authority claims repayment of the amounts and, if not paid, then
enforces recovery (see Article 22.4).
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention to recover (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms the amount to be recovered, and issues a debit note.
Specific cases:
Recoveries for beneficiary in insolvency/bankruptcy — If a beneficiary is in
insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings, the granting authority may have to act quickly in order
to submit its claims in accordance with the deadlines under the national
insolvency/bankruptcy procedures. If immediate action is needed, it will make a provisional
declaration and then complete the contradictory procedure with the beneficiary (and, if
needed, adjust or cancel the provisional declaration).

22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Pre-financing payments
The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial pre-financings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2).
For additional pre-financings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment shows that
less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the
70% threshold and the amount used.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The contribution to the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism will be retained from the pre-financing payments (at the rate and in accordance with
the modalities set out in the Data Sheet, see Point 4.2) and transferred to the Mechanism.]
Pre-financing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts
owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
1. Pre-financing payments
Most programmes foresee the payment of pre-financing, in order to give beneficiaries a
sufficient float to start working on the action.
All pre-financing funds remain EU property until they are cleared against eligible
costs or contributions accepted by the granting authority (normally at final payment). The
pre-financing is therefore an advance payment. It will only become the property of the
beneficiaries when the granting authority approves the corresponding EU funding based on
eligible costs or contributions.
If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the initial pre-financing payment is
automatically paid after grant signature. The consortium does NOT need to submit a request
of payment to get it.
For additional pre-financings (if any), the consortium will be prompted to submit an
additional pre-financing report (which includes a statement on the use of the previous pre-
financing payment; see Article 21.2).
The ‘use’ of pre-financing does not necessarily correspond to incurring actual cost. Pre-
financing can be considered already used if in accordance with the usual accounting practice
of the beneficiary a corresponding amount has been committed (e.g. on subcontracts or
financial support to third parties (FSTP)) for the implementation of the action and cannot be
used for other commitments anymore.
225EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The additional pre-financing payment will be reduced if — according to the statement on use
of the previous pre-financing payment — less than 70% of the previous pre-financing was
used. In that case, the amount of the additional pre-financing set out in the Data Sheet will
be reduced by the difference between 70% of the previous pre-financing and the amount
actually used.
Example: The Data Sheet indicates that there will be an initial pre-financing of EUR 100 000
and one additional pre-financing of EUR 50 000. The consortium reports in the statement of the
use of previous pre-financing payment that only EUR 65 000 have been used so far. The
additional pre-financing payment will be:
{50 000 – ((100 000 x 0.7) – 65 000)} = 45 000
Pre-financing amount:
The amount of the initial and additional pre-financings (if any) are fixed by the granting
authority before grant signature (calculation usually based on a percentage of the maximum
grant amount in Annex 2). It will be lowered for additional pre-financings if the beneficiaries
used less than 70% of the previous pre-financing. The granting authority will inform the
coordinator about the amount paid in the pre-financing payment letter.
Specific cases (pre-financing payments):
Contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM) (HE only) — For programmes
with MIM, the contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism will be automatically deducted
from the initial pre-financing payment and transferred to the MIM (and then released at the
end of the action; see the specific cases on final payment in Article 22.3.4).
Example: For a grant with a maximum amount of EUR 1 000 000 and a 40% pre-financing rate,
EUR 50 000 (5% of the maximum grant amount) will be retained from the EUR 400 000 pre-
financing, resulting in a payment of EUR 350 000 to the coordinator.
Financial support to third parties (FSTP) — Where an action includes financial support to
third parties (e.g. in the form of grants), the commitments entered into by the beneficiaries
vis-à-vis their third parties receiving financial support can be included in the ‘additional pre-
financing report’ for the purpose of calculating the 70% usage threshold, even if no payments
have been made — provided it is the usual accounting practice of the beneficiaries to
consider the corresponding amounts as committed/used and thus no longer available for
other purposes.

General > Article 22.3.2 Beneficiary termination
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
In case of beneficiary termination, the granting authority will determine the provisional amount due for the
beneficiary concerned. Payments (if any) will be made with the next interim or final payment.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary for all reporting
periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the accepted
costs of the beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold
cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum
contributions and financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting amount is the
‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the distribution of
payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments received (if any)}.
If the balance is positive, the amount will be included in the next interim or final payment to the consortium.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be recovered and the
reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the
observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this amount to be paid to the
coordinator (confirmation letter).
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If payment is not made to the
coordinator by the date specified in the confirmation letter, the granting authority may call on the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism to intervene, if continuation of the action is guaranteed and the conditions set out in
the rules governing the Mechanism are met.
In this case, it will send a beneficiary recovery letter, together with a debit note with the terms and date for
payment.
The debit note for the beneficiary will include the amount calculated for the affiliated entities which also had
to end their participation (if any).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.]
The amounts will later on also be taken into account for the next interim or final payment.
227EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recoveries?
If a beneficiary is terminated and leaves the consortium, the granting authority must
provisionally close the accounts for that beneficiary.
The amount due at beneficiary termination will be calculated on the basis of the termination
report, the EU contribution already approved and the report on the distribution of payments
(see also Article 32). It will be equal to the accepted EU contribution minus payments
received by the beneficiary (pre-financing(s) and interim payments; if any).
If the terminated beneficiary is audited later on, but while the project is still ongoing, its
amount due will be re-calculated to determine the amount to recover. If the terminated
beneficiary is audited after the end of the project, the recovery will follow the standard rules
(revised final grant amount calculated).
2. Amount due
The amount due at beneficiary termination is the part of the grant which the beneficiary is
entitled to keep when they leave the project.
Calculation of the amount due at beneficiary termination:
Step 1 — Calculation of the accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
concerned, the granting authority will add the two following:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted costs for the beneficiary (i.e. costs declared in the interim and
termination reports and accepted by the granting authority; see Articles 6 and
27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount for
the beneficiary.
Depending on whether termination is initiated by the beneficiaries or the
granting authority, only costs incurred (see Article 6.1(a)) until end-of-work
date or date of which termination takes effect are eligible (except for costs for
the termination report). Costs relating to contracts due for execution (i.e.
delivery) after end-of-work/termination are NOT eligible (except for pillar-
assessed participants, see Article 10.3).
If the beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, the accepted EU contribution will
be this lower requested amount.
If the beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS,
see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the termination report
but fails to do so, the maximum EU contribution will be capped at the CFS
threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for
costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU contribution
to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the CFS, the maximum EU
contribution to costs will be capped at EUR 429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 60 days of the
date on which termination takes effect), costs and contribution that were not included in an
approved periodic financial report will NOT be taken into account for the calculation of the
accepted EU contribution. The granting authority will NOT send a written reminder and will
not extend the deadline.
228EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article
28), for example if the beneficiary has committed a serious breach of obligations
under the Grant Agreement, the EU contribution will be reduced (decreased)
accordingly. The final result will be the total accepted EU contribution for the
beneficiary.
Balance (amount to be paid or recovered):
The balance (amount to be paid or recovered) will be equal to the accepted EU contribution
minus payments received by the beneficiary (pre-financing(s) and interim payments; if any).
The amount of pre-financing(s) and interim payments received must be communicated to the
granting authority by the coordinator via the report on distribution of payments that must be
submitted as part of the termination (see Article 32.2.2). If the coordinator does not submit
the report on the distribution of payments, the terminated beneficiary will NOT have to repay
any amounts to the consortium.
If the amount due is positive (more accepted EU contribution than payments made), the
granting authority will include the difference in the next interim/final payment to the
consortium.
If the amount due is negative (less accepted EU contribution than payments made), the
beneficiary must pay back the difference, i.e. the money it received in excess, to the
consortium.
Example for calculating the amount due at beneficiary termination:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100 %. No contributions.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Accepted EU contribution: Beneficiary A goes bankrupt in the middle of the action and is terminated
at month 18 (of 36), just before the end of RP1.
Costs declared by beneficiary A in the termination report = EUR 62 500.
Costs rejected for beneficiary A following audit = EUR 12 500.
Accepted costs beneficiary A: EUR 62 500 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 50 000.
Application of funding rate: EUR 50 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Beneficiary balance: Payments received by beneficiary A (according to the report on the distribution
of payments): EUR 60 000.
Beneficiary A balance = EUR 50 000 (accepted EU contribution) – EUR 60 000 (payments received)
= EUR -10 000 (excess payments of EUR 10 000).
Recovery: Amount to be recovered from beneficiary A: EUR 10 000 (negative balance of EUR 10 000
must be returned to the consortium).
3. Procedure
I granting authority will inform the beneficiary concerned about the termination calculations
and give them the opportunity to provide observations (beneficiary termination calculation
letter and final letter).
If the balance is negative, a mechanism is needed to recover this amount and ensure that it
is paid back to the consortium (who will need the missing float to successfully complete the
project). The procedure depends on the type of programme (with or without MIM):
For programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE), the granting authority will
inform the beneficiary concerned about the amount that needs to be returned to the
consortium (and the obligation to do so). For the rest, this will however be treated as a
229EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
matter for the consortium to deal with, and the granting authority will therefore not intervene
any further.
For programmes with MIM (HE only), the granting authority will make sure that the
amount in question is recovered from the beneficiary concerned and injected back into the
consortium (debit note issued by the EU). If the beneficiary doesn’t honour the debit note,
the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and then recover the amount for the
MIM (if needed by enforcing the recovery, using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4).

General > Article 22.3.3 Interim payments
22.3.3 Interim payments
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible costs and contributions claimed for the implementation of the action
during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out the Data Sheet
(see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the reporting period, by
first calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the accepted costs of
each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold cappings
(if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and
financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary termination (if any).
The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
[OPTION for programmes with early pre-financing clearing (before reaching the interim payment ceiling):
If pre-financing clearing before reaching the interim payment ceiling is provided for in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2), the total accepted EU contribution will be lowered to clear the amount of pre-financing payments
previously made.]
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of pre-financing and interim payments (if
any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts owed
by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
1. Interim payments
During the project, the granting authority will make interim payments, if this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement.
The amount of the interim payments will be calculated on the basis of the costs and
contributions reported in the financial statements and the (previous pre-financing and/or
interim) payments already made.
Cost and contributions accepted in a periodic report may still be rejected later if a check,
review, audit or investigation finds out that they were not eligible.
231EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Calculation of interim payments:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution for the action for the
reporting period concerned, the granting authority will add the two following:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted costs reported in the financial statements (see Articles 6 and 27) by
the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount for the
consortium.
The following amounts will flow into the calculation of the maximum EU
contribution to costs for the interim payment to the consortium:
− If a beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, its accepted EU
contribution will be this lower requested amount.
− If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS, see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the
periodic report but fails to do so, its maximum EU contribution will be
capped at the CFS threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU
funding for costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the
requested EU contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not
submit the CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be capped at EUR
429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If during the reporting period the participation of a beneficiary was terminated and if a
grant reduction was applied to the terminated beneficiary, the amount of that grant
reduction will reduce the accepted EU contribution.
Step 2 — Capping the amount at the interim payments ceiling
If the total accepted EU contribution is more than the ceiling set out in the Data Sheet
(Point 4.2) minus the pre-financing(s) and previous interim payments, the payment
will be capped at that limit. The pre-financing clearing is automatically recorded with
costs above the interim payment threshold (normally 90%).
Examples for calculating interim payments:
Case 1:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 1 000 000 and 100% funding rate. No contributions.
Pre-financing of EUR 333 334.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 1 000 000 = EUR 900 000
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by the consortium for RP1: EUR 625 000.
After checking the reports EUR 25 000 claimed by beneficiary A and EUR 15 000 claimed by
beneficiary B are considered not eligible. The granting authority therefore rejects EUR 40 000.
Total accepted costs RP1: EUR 585 000.
Application of funding rate: 100% = EUR 585 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing = EUR 900 000 – EUR 333 334
[pre-financing payment] = EUR 566 666.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 566 666 [EUR 585 000
accepted contribution capped by the interim payment ceiling of EUR 900 000 minus pre-financing of
EUR 333 334].
232EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The difference between 566 666 and 585 000 will be cleared from the pre-financing.
Interim payment RP 2:
Total accepted costs RP2: EUR 162 500.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0 (the 90% ceiling of EUR
900 000 has already been reached after RP1: EUR 333 334 [pre-financing payment]+ EUR 566 666
[RP1 interim payment]).
The accepted cost will be used to further clear the pre-financing.
Case 2 (grant with terminated beneficiary):
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100%. No contributions.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 500 000 = EUR 450 000.
Beneficiary A was terminated before the end of RP1 and the amount due was its accepted costs :EUR 62
500 EUR (no grant reductions applied).
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by beneficiary A: EUR 62 500.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1: EUR 143 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1: EUR 112 500.
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 62 500 + EUR 143 750 + EUR 112 500 = EUR 318 750.
Some costs declared by beneficiary B are rejected for an amount of EUR 12 500. Total accepted costs
RP 1: EUR 318 750 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 306 250.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 306 250 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing = EUR 450 000 [ceiling] – EUR
200 000 [pre-financing payment] = EUR 250 000.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250 000 [EUR 306 250
accepted contribution capped by the interim payment ceiling of EUR 450 000 minus pre-financing of
EUR 333 334].
Case 3:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100%.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 500 000 = EUR 450 000.
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP1: EUR 118 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1: EUR 143 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1: EUR 112 500.
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 118 750 + EUR 143 750 + EUR 112 500 = EUR 375 000.
Some direct costs declared by beneficiary A are rejected for an amount of EUR 12 500.
Total accepted costs RP 1: EUR 375 000 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 362 500.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 362 500 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing: EUR 450 000 – EUR 200 000 = EUR
250 000.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250 000.
Interim payment RP2:
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP2: EUR 25 000.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP2: EUR 37 500.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP2: EUR 37 500.
Total costs declared RP2: EUR 25 000 + EUR 37 500 + EUR 37 500 = EUR 100 000.
Costs rejected for beneficiary B at RP2: EUR 12 500.
Costs rejected for beneficiary C at RP2: EUR 6 250.
233EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Total accepted costs RP2 = EUR 81 250.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 81 250 (total accepted EU contribution).
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0 (the 90% limit has already
been reached in RP1: EUR 200 000 + EUR 250 000 = EUR 450 000).
2. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the coordinator about the interim payment calculations and
give them the possibility to submit observations (payment letter and final letter).

General > Article 22.3.4 Final payment
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the remaining part of the eligible costs and
contributions claimed for the implementation of the action(if any).
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all reporting
periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the total
accepted costs of each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs, CFS
threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump
sum contributions and financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting amount is the
‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
If the resulting amount is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.2, it will be limited to
the latter.
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
If the no-profit rule is provided for in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2), the grant must not produce a profit (i.e.
surplus of the amount obtained following Step 2 plus the action’s revenues, over the eligible costs and
contributions approved by the granting authority).
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4), for beneficiaries that are
profit legal entities [OPTION for programmes with exception for revenues: [OPTION if selected for the call:
(— with the exception of [insert exceptions], which are not considered as revenues)]].
If there is a profit, it will be deducted in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of the eligible costs
approved by the granting authority (as compared to the amount calculated following Steps 1 and 2 minus the
contributions).
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of pre-financing and interim
payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{final grant amount
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments made (if any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The amount retained for the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism (see above) will be released and paid to the coordinator (in accordance with the rules
governing the Mechanism).]
235EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts owed by
a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
If [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): — despite the release of the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism contribution —] the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be recovered and
the reasons why
- [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): requesting a report on the
distribution of payments to the beneficiaries within 30 days of receiving notification and]
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
[OPTION 1 for programmes without Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations are submitted
(or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has received), it will confirm
the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with a debit note with the terms and date for
payment.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations are submitted (or
the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has received) and the coordinator
has submitted the report on the distribution of payments, it will calculate the share of the debt per
beneficiary, by:
(a) identifying the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:
{{{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action},
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments received by the beneficiary (if any)}}
and
(b) dividing the debt:
{{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned

and confirm the amount to be recovered from each beneficiary concerned (confirmation letter), together
with debit notes with the terms and date for payment.
The debit notes for beneficiaries will include the amounts calculated for their affiliated entities (if any).
If the coordinator has not submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the granting authority will
recover the full amount from the coordinator (confirmation letter and debit note with the terms and date
for payment).]
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.
236EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Final payment — Recoveries?
At the final payment (payment of the balance), the granting authority must close the
accounts for the action.
The final payment amount (to be paid or recovered) will be calculated on the basis of the
costs and contributions reported in the financial statements and the payments already made.
Cost and contributions accepted in a periodic report may still be rejected later if a
check, review, audit or investigation finds out that they were not eligible.
2. Final grant amount
The final grant amount is the total EU contribution to which the consortium as a whole is
entitled to at the end of the action. It can never be higher than the maximum grant amount
in Annex 2, but it can be lower if there are insufficient total accepted eligible costs and
contributions or if the granting authority applies a grant reduction (see Article 28).
The final grant amount will depend on two types of criteria:
− implementation criteria, i.e. was the action implemented as described in Annex 1
and in accordance with the obligations set out in the Grant Agreement.
This is mostly a technical analysis by the granting authority of the work performed
during the action, as compared with the activities set out in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. If the action was not properly implemented, the granting authority may
decide to reduce the grant (see Article 28).
− financial criteria, including:
− the amount of (accepted) eligible costs and contributions
− the funding rate(s)
− the maximum grant amount (Annex 2)
− the profit.
Calculation of the final grant amount:
Step 1 — Total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the total accepted EU contribution for the action, the granting
authority will determine the following elements:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted eligible costs reported in the financial statements (see Articles 6
and 27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount
for the consortium.
− If a beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, its accepted EU
contribution will be this lower requested amount.
− If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS, see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the
periodic report but fails to do so, its maximum EU contribution will be
capped at the CFS threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
237EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: The beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for
costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU
contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the
CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be capped at EUR 429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article
28), for example due to improper implementation of the action, the EU contribution
will be reduced (decreased) accordingly. The final result will be the total accepted
EU contribution.
Step 2 — Limit to maximum grant amount
If the total accepted EU contribution is higher than the maximum grant amount for the
action in Annex 2, it will be capped at the maximum grant amount.
Step 3 — No-profit rule (if applicable; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2)
For entities that work for profit (in their usual activities), EU grants must not have the
purpose or effect of producing a profit during the action. Beneficiaries that are profit
legal entities (and that do not fall under any of the other exceptions, see below) must
therefore declare their revenues at the end of the action.
For the calculation of the profit, only the EU grant (and other EU grants, if any; see
Article 6.3) and the revenues from the action (e.g. from the sale of results, such as
products, services and publications, conference fees) are taken into account. Grants from
other donors for the action or for the activities of the beneficiaries (‘financial
contributions’) are NOT considered as revenue.
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4),
for beneficiaries that are profit legal entities. The revenue must be:
− established (i.e. revenue that has been collected AND entered in the accounts)
− generated (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but which has been
generated)
or
− confirmed (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but for which the
beneficiary has a commitment or written confirmation).
Exceptions: Only for-profit entities must declare revenues. In addition, certain types
of grants are exempted:
− actions with the objective to reinforce the financial capacity of the beneficiaries
(— this should be clear from the call)
− actions where the continuity after their end is to be ensured by the income
generated by the action (— this should be clear from the call)
− grants in the form of study, research or training scholarships paid to natural
persons or as other forms of direct support paid to natural persons who are
most in need (e.g. refugees, the unemployed)
− grants with a maximum amount of not more than EUR 60 000 (low value
grants)
Profit calculation and deduction: The declared revenues will be taken into account
by the system and the profit (if any) will be deducted from the amount resulting from
238EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of eligible costs (i.e. not the
entire profit is deducted, only an amount proportionate to the EU share of funding the
action):
{profit}
multiplied by
{final rate of reimbursement of the eligible costs}
The profit is calculated as follows:
{((amount after step 2 [the lower of total accepted EU contribution or maximum grant
amount]) plus action revenue) minus accepted eligible costs}
The final rate of reimbursement is distinct from the funding rate. It is the
proportion of EU funding, i.e. the eligible cost of the action compared to the final
grant amount. It is calculated as follows:
{(Amount after step 2 [the lower of total accepted EU contribution or maximum grant
amount]) divided by accepted eligible cost}
Balance — Payment or recovery:
The balance (amount to be paid or recovered) will be equal to the final grant amount minus
the payments already made to the consortium (pre-financing(s) and interim payments).
If the resulting amount is positive (final grant amount higher than payments made), the
granting authority will pay the difference as final payment.
If the resulting amount is negative (final grant amount lower than payments made), the
final payment will take the form of a recovery (the consortium will have to pay back the EU
contribution received in excess).
Example for calculating the final grant amount:
At the end of an action with a maximum grant amount of EUR 1 million and a funding rate of 70% the
beneficiary, a private IT-startup, submits the last periodic report for the final payment. The beneficiary
has declared eligible cost of EUR 1,7 million during all reporting periods. The financial statements of the
beneficiary show that profit was generated due to a ministry of a Member State procuring for EUR 800
000 a licence for the use of an IT tool developed under one of the work packages during the last
reporting period of the action. The grant does not provide for a specific exemption from the no-profit
rule.
Relevant data (see Data Sheet):
Exempted: No (no specific exemption under the grant, and no general exemption as the IT-startup is
a for-profit entity)
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 1 000 000
Funding rate: 70%
Accepted eligible cost: EUR 1 700 000
Revenue: EUR 800 000
Step 1 – Total accepted EU contribution: With a funding rate of 70% applied to the accepted
eligible cost of EUR 1 700 000, the maximum EU contribution to costs would be
EUR 1 700 000 x 0.7 = EUR 1 190 000.
Step 2 – Limit to maximum grant amount: However, the accepted EU contribution of EUR 1 190
000 amount is capped by the maximum grant amount to EUR 1 000 000.
Step 3 – No–Profit: The profit would be EUR 1 000 000 [EU grant from step 2 amount] + EUR 800
000 [revenue] – EUR 1 700 000 [accepted eligible cost] = EUR 100 000
The amount to be deducted would be the profit multiplied by the final rate of reimbursement:
EUR 100 000 [profit] x (EUR 1 000 000 [step 2 amount] / EUR 1 700 000 [accepted eligible cost]).
That is EUR 100 000 [profit] x 58,82% [final rate of reimbursement] = EUR 58 820
Final grant amount = EUR 1 000 000 [step 2 amount] – EUR 58 820 [profit deduction] = EUR 941

239EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Specific cases (final payment):
Combining EU Synergy actions — If the same action received more than one source of EU
funding (only allowed for actions flagged as ‘Synergy action’, see Data Sheet, Point 1), at
final payment it needs to be ensured that the combined actual funding rates do not go
beyond 100% of the accepted eligible cost of the action and the total EU funding (of all EU
grants combined) will accordingly be taken into account for the calculation of revenue.
Income from exploitation of results (HE only) — For actions under Horizon Europe,
income generated by the exploitation of results are NOT considered as revenues. Exploitation
is defined in Annex 5 (e.g. commercialising a product or service).
Income from building up of reserves (operating grants in all programmes) — For
operating grants, amounts which are dedicated to the building up of reserves are NOT
considered as revenues.
Release of the contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM) (HE only) —
For programmes with MIM, the contribution to the MIM that was kept from the pre-financing
(see the specific cases on pre-financing in Article 22.3.1) must be released back to the
consortium.
If the balance is positive, the contribution will be released in a separate payment.
If the balance is negative, the amount to be recovered (debt) will be first compensated
against the MIM contribution released. If this amount is enough to cover the debt, the
recovery process ends here (the consortium will be paid out the remainder of the MIM
contribution, if any is left after the compensation). If the released contribution is not
sufficient to cover the debt, the rest will be recovered (see procedure below).
3. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the consortium about the final payment calculations and
give them the opportunity to provide observations (payment letter and final letter).
If the balance is negative, the amount needs to be recovered. The procedure depends on the
type of programme (with or without MIM).
For programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): At the payment of the
balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole amount that needs to be recovered (i.e.
paid back to the granting authority) — even if it has not been the final recipient of the
concerned amount.
Therefore, the coordinator will receive the final letter with a debit note for the full amount of
the debt of the consortium, with the instructions for payment. If the coordinator does not pay
the debt, the granting authority will enforce the recovery using the mechanisms set out in
Article 22.4.
For programmes with MIM (HE only):
The coordinator is not fully liable for the whole amount that needs to be recovered; each
beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid
for costs declared by their affiliated entities.
Therefore, the coordinator will receive a request to submit the report on the distribution of
payments (in the payment letter) and the negative balance (debt) will be split among the
beneficiaries that received more money than their share in the final grant amount (payments
in excess; based on their eligible costs and contributions). Each beneficiary’s share in the
debt is calculated using the formula:
{((total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary)
divided by
240EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
total accepted EU contribution for the action)
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action}
The negative balance will be then divided among those beneficiaries who received payments
in excess, in proportion to their relative share of the total payments in excess. Each of those
beneficiaries will receive a separate debit note for their share of the debt, with the
instructions for payment (beneficiary recovery letter).
For each beneficiary that does not pay their debt, the granting authority will enforce the
recovery using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4.
Beneficiaries who did not receive more money than their share of the final grant amount will
thus not have to contribute to the repayment of the negative balance. Similarly, the
coordinator is only liable for the full amount of the debt, if they did not submit the report on
the distribution of payments (only in this case will they receive a debit note for the full
amount).
Example (negative balance with MIM):
Grant with four beneficiaries: A, B, C, D.
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 3 000 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts: A= EUR
800 000; B= EUR 1 200 000; C= EUR 600 000; D= EUR 400 000).
Funding rate: 100 %.
MIM contribution: 5% of 3 000 000 = EUR 150 000.
Payments received: EUR 2 700 000 (EUR 150 000 retained for the MIM).
Final grant amount:
Total accepted costs: EUR 3 080 000.
Application of the funding rate: 100% = EUR 3 430 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Grant reduction of EUR 400 000
Accepted EU contribution: 3 080 0–0 - 400 000 = EUR 2 680 000.
Limit to maximum grant amount: not applicable (because maximum grant amount > accepted EU
contribution)
No receipts/profit.
Final grant amount: EUR 2 680 000
Balance & MIM release:
Payments made: EUR 2 700 000.
Balance: EUR 2 680 000 (final grant amoun–) - EUR 2 700 000 (payments made) = EUR -20 000 (excess
payments of EUR 20 000).
Compensating against MIM and release: EUR 150 000 – 20 000 = EUR 130 000.

General > Article 22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount — Recovery
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount — Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see Article 25) —
the granting authority rejects costs or contributions (see Article 27) or reduces the grant (see Article 28), it
will calculate the revised final grant amount for the beneficiary concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary, by
calculating the ‘revised accepted costs’ and ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total accepted EU
contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its share in the final
grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is calculated as
follows:
{{{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action}.
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the
observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with
a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.
1. Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery?
If there is an audit (or similar, such as for instance an OLAF investigation) after the end of
the action which finds ineligible costs or contributions (or breaches that require a grant
reduction), the granting authority will have to recalculate the grant for the beneficiary
concerned.
The amount to be recovered after the final payment will be calculated by comparing the
beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount (i.e. at the final payment of the grant) and the
beneficiary’s revised final grant amount (i.e. amount entitled to after the audit).
242EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Calculation of the revised final grant amount:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of revised accepted EU contribution for the
beneficiary concerned, the granting authority will consider the:
− maximum revised EU contribution to costs, which is the result of
multiplying the accepted costs for the beneficiary, after implementation of the
adjustments (see Articles 6, 25 and 27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and
sum them up to a total amount for the beneficiary.
− revised accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-
rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs after the
adjustments.
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article 28),
for example if the audit finds irregularities in the action implementation by the
beneficiary, the revised accepted EU contribution will be reduced (decreased)
accordingly. The final result will be the revised total accepted EU contribution for
the beneficiary.
Amount to be recovered:
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e.
its share in the final grant amount for the action), there will need to be a recovery of the
difference.
The beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount (what the beneficiary was entitled to, based
on its eligible costs and contributions, when the final payment was done) is:
{((total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary) divided by (total accepted EU contribution for
the action)) multiplied by final grant amount for the action}
The beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount is not necessarily equal to the money it
received from the coordinator. The consortium may have decided on a different distribution of
the EU funding. However, the amount to be recovered will be calculated using the
beneficiary’s notional share irrespectively of the amount it actually received from the
coordinator.
The amount to be recovered from the beneficiary will be:
{the beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount}
minus
{the beneficiary’s revised final grant amount}
2. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the beneficiary concerned about the audit implementation
calculations and give them the opportunity to provide observations (audit implementation
pre-information letter and final letter).
For the recovery process, see Article 22.2. If the beneficiary does not pay the debt, the
granting authority will enforce the recovery using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4.

General > Article 22.4 Enforced recoveries
22.4 Enforced recoveries
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts
owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may be offset
before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency,
debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) [OPTION 1 for programmes with pre-financing guarantees: by drawing on the financial
guarantee(s) (if any)][OPTION 2 for programmes without pre-financing guarantees: financial
guarantee(s): not applicable]
(c) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: by holding other
beneficiaries jointly and severally liable (if any; see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)] [OPTION 2 for
programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: joint and several liability of
beneficiaries: not applicable]
(d) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of affiliated entities: by holding
affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)][OPTION 2 for
programmes without joint and several liability of affiliated entities: joint and several liability of
affiliated entities: not applicable] or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that the granting authority is the European
Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable decision under Article 299 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation
2024/2509.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If the Mutual Insurance Mechanism
was called on by the granting authority to intervene, recovery will be continued in the name of the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism. If two debit notes were sent, the second one (in the name of the Mutual Insurance
Mechanism) will be considered to replace the first one (in the name of the granting authority). Where the
MIM intervened, offsetting, enforceable decisions or any other of the above-mentioned forms of enforced
recovery may be used mutatis mutandis.]
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 22.5,
from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the full payment is
received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against
the principal.
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless Directive 2015/236642
applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by offsetting or
enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission (see also Article 43).

1. Enforced recoveries
If the coordinator/beneficiary concerned does not pay a debit note by the specified deadline,
the granting authority will recover the amount (with interest at the rate set out in Article
22.5), in one of the following ways:
− by offsetting it
− for programmes with pre-financing guarantees (most programmes, except HE): by
drawing on the financial guarantee(s) (if any)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): by drawing on the Mutual Insurance
Mechanism (MIM), and then follow up with a debit note on behalf of the MIM against
the debtor (and continue the recovery procedure applying any of the other measures
to enforce the recovery)
− if the granting authority has requested joint and several liability: by calling upon
the beneficiary(ies) or affiliated entities concerned (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
or
− by either:
− taking legal action in a national court or the European Court of Justice (see
Article 43) or
− adopting a decision that is enforceable within the meaning of Article 299
TFEU38.39
‘Offsetting’ allows to directly deduct the amount owed by the coordinator/beneficiary from
any other amount that the granting authority owes to the coordinator/beneficiary. With the
offsetting, both amounts are considered paid.
Offsetting is normally implemented as a public law measure (i.e. directly on the
basis of Article 102 of the Financial Regulation 2024/2509). Therefore, the dispute
settlement normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU action; see Article
43.2).
For the cases not covered by the Financial Regulation, offsetting will however —
exceptionally — be implemented as a purely contractual measure (e.g. offsetting against
international organisations). In this case, the normal contractual means for dispute
settlement apply (i.e. Article 272 TFEU action, arbitration, etc; see Article 43.2).
Normally, offsetting is carried out after the deadline specified in the debit note has expired.
However, in exceptional circumstances, the granting authority may offset before this date in
38 See Article 299 TFEU: “Acts of the Council, the Commission or the European Central Bank which impose a
pecuniary obligation on persons other than States, shall be enforceable. Enforcement shall be governed by the
rules of civil procedure in force in the State in the territory of which it is carried out. The order for its
enforcement shall be appended to the decision, without other formality than verification of the authenticity of
the decision, by the national authority which the government of each Member State shall designate for this
purpose and shall make known to the Commission and to the Court of Justice of the European Union. When
these formalities have been completed on application by the party concerned, the latter may proceed to
enforcement in accordance with the national law, by bringing the matter directly before the competent authority.
Enforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court. However, the courts of the country concerned
shall have jurisdiction over complaints that enforcement is being carried out in an irregular manner.”
39 See Article 100(2) Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 100(2) Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
245EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
order to safeguard the EU financial interests (see Article 102(1) Financial Regulation
2024/250940).
If the offsetting takes place after the deadline for payment has expired, the interest must
also be offset. The interest is normally offset first, before the principal amount.
‘Drawing on the MIM’ is available only for programmes with MIM (HE only). For 2021-2027,
MIM interventions are limited to defaults in the context of beneficiary terminations and
negative payment of the balance (see Articles 22.3.2 and 22.3.4); the MIM can no longer be
called on to intervene after the payment of the balance (see Article 22.3.5).
‘Joint and several liability’ means to hold another participant liable for paying the debit note.
There are two types of joint and several liability:
− joint and several liabilities of beneficiaries (only for programmes without MIM; all
programmes except HE) — ONLY if selected by the granting authority during grant
preparation; check the Data Sheet
− joint and several liability of affiliated entities (all programmes) — ONLY if selected by
the granting authority during grant preparation; check the Data Sheet
These joint and several liability regimes are subject to ceilings. Affiliated entities are
generally only liable up to their maximum grant amount in Annex 2. This is also the default
option for beneficiaries (‘limited liability’), but for them the granting authority may also select
another option (either up to the maximum grant amount for the action (‘unconditional
liability’) or no joint and several liability (‘individual liability’)).
‘Enforceable decisions’ are public law decisions, taken directly on the basis of Article 100(2)
of the Financial Regulation 2024/250941. The decision will contain a summary of the claim,
state that the debtor has not paid its debt (despite having been sent a debit note and several
reminders) and indicate the amount of the debt. The decision — duly endorsed with the order
for enforcement issued by the competent authority in the Member State concerned — allows
to have the debtor’s assets seized. Since they are public law decisions, the dispute
settlement normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU action; see Article
43.2).
Specific case (recoveries):
International organisations (IOs) — Enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU (and
other public law decisions) will NOT be taken against international organisations where this
would be contrary to the privileges and immunities accorded by their constituent documents
or international law (see Article 10.2).
Offsetting (see Article 102 of the Financial Regulation 2024/250942) is — by contrast — a
measure that may be taken in relation to international organisations, however NOT as public
law measure as such but as a purely contractual measure (on the basis of Article 22.4 of the
Grant Agreement). Offsetting for international organisations will therefore be subject to the
contractual means for dispute settlement (i.e. arbitration; see Article 43.2).

22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the beneficiaries are
entitled to late-payment interest at the rate applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) for its main
refinancing operations in euros (‘reference rate’), plus the rate specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The
reference rate is the rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the coordinator only on
request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional and local
government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State for the purpose of this
Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not be considered
as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for payment (see
above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.
22.5.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see
Article 29) and the grant or the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Late-payment interest (to be paid by the EU)
If the granting authority pays late, i.e. beyond the payment deadlines, it will automatically
pay the consortium late payment interest for the overdue period unless:
− all beneficiaries in the Grant Agreement are Member States or entities acting on behalf
of Member States or
− the deadline for payment is actually not overdue because the payment deadline is
formally suspended (see Article 29) or payments are formally suspended (see Article
30) or
− the amount of the late-payment interest is not higher than EUR 200, in which case it
will only be paid upon request from the coordinator.
Late-payment interest is paid separately and on top of the grant amounts.
Late-payment interest may also be due from the beneficiaries, if they must pay back
undue amounts in the context of a recovery and are late with this payment (see Article 22.2).

[OPTION 1 for programmes without pre-financing guarantees: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with pre-financing guarantees:
23.1 Pre-financing guarantee
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2), the beneficiaries must provide (one or more)
pre-financing guarantee(s) in accordance with the timing and the amounts set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them to the granting authority in due time before the pre-financing they are
linked to.
The guarantees must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the following
conditions:
(a) be provided by a bank or approved financial institution established in the EU or — if requested by
the coordinator and accepted by the granting authority — by a third party or a bank or financial
institution established outside the EU offering equivalent security
(b) the guarantor stands as first-call guarantor and does not require the granting authority to first have
recourse against the principal debtor (i.e. the beneficiary concerned) and
(c) remain explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the form of a
recovery, until five months after the debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
They will be released within the following month.
23.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If the beneficiaries breach their obligation to provide the pre-financing guarantee, the pre-financing will not
be paid.
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.]
1. Pre-financing guarantees (most programmes, except HE)
What? For programmes that allow for pre-financing guarantees (most programmes except
HE), a guarantee may be required in particular where the financial capacity checks of one (or
more) of the beneficiaries in the consortium reveal weaknesses. The guarantee will be asked
from the coordinator, for the entire consortium. It allows the granting authority to protect
itself against the risk of losing pre-financing (i.e. the consortium not being able to honour a
recovery debt at the end of the action).
When? Where required by the granting authority, guarantees are a prerequisite for paying
out the pre-financing. They are therefore usually requested during grant preparation and
have to be provided by the coordinator before grant signature.
However, the obligation to provide a valid guarantee continues to apply during the entire
project. If for any reason the guarantee becomes invalid (e.g. because the issuing bank
ceases its operations), it needs to be replaced by a new guarantee. If the coordinator
refuses to provide a new guarantee, the grant can be terminated.
248EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
How? Pre-financing guarantees usually take the form of a guarantee by a bank or other
approved financial institution established in the EU. The costs for obtaining such a guarantee
can be declared as eligible cost under the Grant Agreement. If accepted by the granting
authority, guarantees can also be obtained from other providers (e.g. subsidiaries may obtain
a guarantee from their parent company).
The pre-financing guarantee must be sent by the coordinator as original (by registered post
with proof of delivery OR courier service) to the postal address of the granting authority.

beneficiaries must provide certificates on their financial statements (CFS), in accordance with the schedule,
threshold and conditions set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them as part of the periodic report (see Article 21).
The certificates must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal, cover the costs declared on the

conditions:
(a) be provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent and complies with
Directive 2006/43/EC43 (or for public bodies: by a competent independent public officer)
(b) the verification must be carried out according to the highest professional standards to ensure that the

European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) from using their prerogatives for audits and investigations under the
Agreement (see Article 25).
If the costs (or a part of them) were already audited by the granting authority, these costs do not need to be
covered by the certificate and will not be counted for calculating the threshold (if any). ]
43 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and
consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. Certificate on the financial statements
What? If a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) is required for an interim or final
payment, the beneficiaries (and affiliated entities) concerned must provide it as part of the
periodic reporting (see Article 21.2).
The CFS is a certificate covering the actual costs and costs (or contributions) according to
usual accounting practices contained in a financial statement.
It is based on agreed-upon procedures within the meaning of International Standard on
Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (revised) for Agreed-upon Procedures Engagements issued by
the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
Provided that the provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC (or similar standards) are complied
with, the participant is free to choose a qualified external auditor, including its usual
external auditor:
251EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘qualified’ means qualified in accordance with national legislation implementing
Directive 2006/4343 (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive)
− ‘external’ means the auditor is independent from the participant.
In accordance with the agreed-upon procedures set out in the CFS, the CFS auditor must
report on the correct declaration of cost in the financial statement, i.e. that they are
accurately recorded in the beneficiary’s accounting system and eligible.
The CFS auditor has to explain findings of deviation from the rules (for any reason) in detail
in the certificate. The granting authority will consider the explanation in light of the facts
reported by the auditor, and decide on steps to take.
If the auditor finds discrepancies/exceptions, the cost item should normally not be
included in the financial statement submitted to the granting authority (and does not need to
be mentioned in the CFS). However, if the issue cannot be rectified by excluding the costs
from the financial statement or is of more serious systemic nature, it should be reported to
the EU project officer in charge of your grant.
When & How? The CFS must be provided by the beneficiary concerned, as part of their
financial report, directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool. The template is available there
for download.
The CFS threshold and schedule are set out in the Data Sheet, Point 4.3. It depends on the
amount of EU contribution requested (new for 2021-2027: not only the amount of actual
costs and unit costs according to usual cost accounting practices declared) and is calculated
automatically by the system for each entity separately; i.e. each beneficiary/affiliated entity
must submit a CFS if they reach the threshold (without taking into account the EU
contribution requested by the others).
If the participation of the beneficiary in the grant has been audited by they granting
authority, costs and contributions covered by the audit are NOT counted for the
threshold. If nevertheless the beneficiary reaches the threshold (after deducting the costs
and contributions audited) those do not need to be covered (again) by the CFS.
If a certificate is required, it must cover all applicable cost categories set out in the template.
The costs of a required CFS are eligible under the applicable cost category (usually category
C.3 as a cost for services). The costs for CFS that are not mandatory (e.g. because the
threshold was not reached or because it was not required in that reporting period) are NOT
eligible (because not necessary for the action).
Examples (errors):
Grant Agreement with 2 reporting periods (an interim reporting period and a final)
Point 4.3 of the Data Sheet: CFS mandatory only at final payment and only if requested EU
contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000
Beneficiary A submits a CFS with the reports of the interim reporting period: the costs of the CFS
are not eligible (wrong timing)
Beneficiary B requests EUR 380 000 of EU contribution and submits a CFS at the final payment: the
costs of the CFS are not eligible (wrong threshold)

annual accounts and consolidated accounts, amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and
repealing Council Directive 84/253/EEC (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
252EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The CFS does not affect the granting authority’s right to carry out its own assessment or
audits. Neither does the reimbursement of costs covered by a certificate preclude the
granting authority, the European Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), the
European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) or the European Court of Auditors from carrying
out checks, reviews, audits and investigations in accordance with the Grant Agreement.
Specific case (CFS):
Public bodies — Public bodies can choose an external auditor or an independent public
officer. In this case, independence is usually defined as independence ‘in fact and in
appearance’ (e.g. that the officer is not involved in drawing up the financial statements). It is
for each public body to appoint the public officer and ensure their independence. The
certificate should refer to this appointment.
Pillar-assessed entities — Pillar-assessed participants can choose their regular internal or
external auditors in accordance with their internal financial regulations and procedures as
assessed by the European Commission in accordance with Article 157(3) of the Financial
Regulation 2024/250944 (see Article 10.3).

(b) the verification must be carried out according to the highest professional standards to ensure that the
methodology for declaring costs according to usual accounting practices complies with the
provisions under the Agreement.
If the certificate is approved, amounts declared in line with this methodology will not be challenged
subsequently, unless the beneficiary concealed information for the purpose of the approval.]

1. Certificate on the compliance of the methodology for usual cost accounting
practices (CoMUC) (DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM)
What? For programmes where costs (or contributions) according to usual accounting
practices are eligible (DEP, EDF, CEF? UCPM) beneficiaries (and affiliated entities) that use
these accounting practices to charge costs under their grants may submit a certificate on the
compliance of usual cost accounting practices (CoMUC) to the granting authority for approval.
The CoMUC is a certificate covering the methodology that is used to charge costs (or
contributions) according to usual cost accounting practices.
It is a certificate based on agreed-upon procedures within the meaning of International
Standard on Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (revised) for Agreed-upon Procedures
Engagements issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
Provided that the provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC (or similar standards) are complied
with, the participant is free to choose a qualified external auditor, including its usual
external auditor:
254EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘qualified’ means qualified in accordance with national legislation implementing
Directive 2006/4345 (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive)
− ‘external’ means the auditor is independent from the participant.
When & How? Requests for approval can be submitted at any time to the granting authority
of an ongoing grant.
Best practice: In order to ensure that the auditor has enough information to get assurance on
the methodology, it is recommended to request it only after the first reporting period has
passed.
Approval is limited to the (cost) accounting practices described and certified in the certificate.
Approval is valid for:
− all grants of the beneficiary under the EU programme for which it was submitted (it is
not limited to a single grant)
− all costs and contributions declared according to the certified accounting practices,
including costs and contributions declared before the granting authority approval (if
the beneficiary can show that they were declared according to the approved
practices).
If the granting authority approves the CoMUC, it will afterwards not challenge any amounts
that the beneficiary declares using the certified methodology — unless information was
concealed or fraud or corruption was used to obtain the approval.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should nevertheless keep detailed records and other supporting
documents (to prove that their methodology complied with the rules, if necessary).
If the beneficiary changes its accounting practices, the certificate does not apply to any
cost incurred under the changed accounting practices. The beneficiary may submit another
request for approval to the granting authority for the new practices.
If the beneficiary declares personnel costs according to the changed cost accounting
practices before the new certificate is approved, it bears the full risk of non-approval and
cost rejection by the granting authority.
If the beneficiary also has grants in other EU programmes with similar cost eligibility rules,
the CoMUC can in principle also be relied on for these other programmes. However, it is at
the discretion of the granting authorities of those other programmes, whether they consider
their rules as equivalent and accept the CoMUC also for their programme.
The costs of the CoMUC are NOT eligible and cannot be charged to the EU action (because
not necessary for the action — the CoMUC is not mandatory and not linked to a specific
action).
Specific case (CoMUC):
Public bodies — Public bodies can choose an external auditor or an independent public
officer. In this case, independence is usually defined as independence ‘in fact and in

- have formalised documentation on the systems and processes for calculating their costs and
contributions (i.e. formally approved and in writing), have participated in at least […] actions under
[insert name of previous programme, e.g. Horizon 2020] and participate in at least […] ongoing
actions under [insert name of current programme, e.g. Horizon Europe]

This audit will be carried out as follows:
Step 1 — Application by the beneficiary.
Step 2 — If the application is accepted, the granting authority will carry out the systems and process
audit, complemented by an audit of transactions (on a sample of the beneficiary’s [insert name

Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for costs.
According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU contribution to costs ≥ EUR
430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be
capped at EUR 429 999.

25.1.1 Internal checks
The granting authority may — during the action or afterwards — check the proper implementation of the
action and compliance with the obligations under the Agreement, including assessing costs and contributions,
deliverables and reports.
1. Checks (by the granting authority)
What & When? The granting authority may — at any moment including after the end —
check aspects relating to the grant relating to the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples:
1. After receiving the reports (see Article 21), the granting authority checks the different
documents (explanation of the work carried out, overview of the progress, explanation of the
use of resources, etc.), for consistency with the description and work plan of the action.
2. The granting authority performs a plagiarism check on documents submitted by the
consortium.
3. After receiving information about misconducts concerning an entity that participates in EU
actions, the granting authority checks all the grant in order to see if it needs to take action.
4. After the end of the action, the granting authority receives a complaint by one of the
beneficiaries that another beneficiary does not respect its intellectual property obligations and
decides to look into this allegation.
These checks may concern beneficiaries or other partners involved in the action — which is
why beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights towards
other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties providing in-kind
contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)) by
including appropriate clauses in their contracts with them, see Articles 8 and 9.
Checks themselves are internal, i.e. usually carried out directly by staff of the granting
authority based on available documents. If needed, the granting authority may, however,
request information from the beneficiaries (see Article 19.1).
Example: An internal check shows that the beneficiaries did not clearly explain the allocation
and use of resources in their periodic report. The granting authority asks for more information
by a given date.
The granting authority may carry out these checks on its own or with the assistance of
external expert(s) — without asking the beneficiaries for approval before appointing them.
In this case, the granting authority will ensure that there is no conflict of interest by asking
the expert(s) to sign a declaration.
259EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the check shows ineligible costs or contributions or serious breach of obligations, this may
lead to rejection or grant reduction and, if necessary, recovery (see Articles 27, 28 and 22.2)
or any other measure mentioned in Chapter 5.
If a more in-depth examination is required, the granting authority may start a review or an
audit.

General > Article 25.1.2 Granting authority project reviews
25.1.2 Project reviews
25.1.2 Project reviews
The granting authority may carry out reviews on the proper implementation of the action and compliance
with the obligations under the Agreement (general project reviews or specific issues reviews).
Such project reviews may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out
in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned
and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent, outside experts. If it uses outside experts,
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right to object on grounds of
commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline
requested — any information and data in addition to deliverables and reports already submitted (including
information on the use of resources). The granting authority may request beneficiaries to provide such
information to it directly. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings, including with the
outside experts.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises (including to the
outside experts) and must ensure that information requested is readily available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
On the basis of the review findings, a project review report will be drawn up.
The granting authority will formally notify the project review report to the coordinator or beneficiary
concerned, which has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations.
Project reviews (including project review reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed with the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
1. Project reviews (by the granting authority)
What? The granting authority may — at any moment and until the time-limit set out in the
Data Sheet (Point 6) — carry out a project review.
Reviews normally concern mainly the technical implementation of the action, but they may
also cover financial and budgetary aspects or compliance with other obligations under the
Grant Agreement. They usually concern the entire project, but may exceptionally also focus
on issues related to only one specific beneficiary.
They may also extend to other participants involved in the action — which is why
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights also towards
those other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients
of financial support to third parties (FSTP)) by including appropriate clauses in their contracts
with them, see Articles 8 and 9.
Project reviews consist in an in-depth examination (often done with the help of independent
experts) of the progress of the action, and in particular:
− the degree to which the work plan has been carried out and whether all expected
deliverables were completed
− whether the objectives of the action are still relevant
261EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− how resources were planned and used in relation to the achieved progress, and if their
use respected the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness
− the management procedures and methods of the action
− the beneficiaries’ contributions and integration within the action
− for Horizon Europe: the expected potential scientific, technological, economic,
competitive and social impact, and plans for using and disseminating results.
For some types of action, they are done regularly (e.g. for the periodic reports related to a
payment, to help the granting authority to properly assess the action implementation and the
work carried out by the beneficiaries), for others they are done ad hoc.
If the review shows ineligible costs or contributions, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud
or serious breach of obligations (including non- or improper implementation of the action as
described in Annex 1), this may lead to suspension, termination, rejection, grant reduction
and recovery (see Articles 30, 31, 32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and to exclusion and/or financial
penalties (see Article 34).
If carried out during the implementation of the action, a review may also recommend
reorientations to the action.
2. Procedure
How? The review will be initiated by a project review invitation letter sent to the
coordinator (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary concerned) through the Portal.
The letter will also mention the names of the independent experts that have been appointed
(if any). The consortium may object to an expert, but only on the grounds of commercial
confidentiality or conflict of interests.
The review may include on-the-spot visits or a review meeting (on the granting authority
premises or anywhere relevant for the action). If there is a meeting, the invitation will
indicate the documents that will be discussed, normally:
− Annex 1 (the contractual description of the action against which the assessment will
be made)
− for periodic reviews: the periodic report(s) (technical and financial) for the period(s)
under review (including documents related to financial/budgetary issues)
− deliverables that were due
− for final reviews: the periodic reports (technical and financial) for all periods (including
documents related to financial/budgetary issues).
The results of the review will be recorded in a project review report.
The project review report together with the granting authority comments will be notified to
the coordinator (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary concerned), who will have 30 days to
submit observations (contradictory project review procedure; not to be confused with
the separate contradictory procedure for any subsequent rejection, grant reduction or
suspension/termination procedure under Articles 27, 28, 31 and 32).
The granting authority operational services (authorising officers) will analyse the comments
received and decide on the follow-up, if any.

Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the beneficiary concerned and will be considered to
start on the date of the notification.
The granting authority may use its own audit service, delegate audits to a centralised service or use external
audit firms. If it uses an external firm, the beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right to object
on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline requested — any
information (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data) to verify
compliance with the Agreement. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with
Article 13.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises (including for the
external audit firm) and must ensure that information requested is readily available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which has 30 days from
receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and will be formally
notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
1. Audits (by the granting authority)
What? The granting authority may — at any moment and up until the time-limit set out in
the Data Sheet (Point 6) — carry out an audit.
Record-keeping — Once an audit has started, the beneficiary must keep ALL the
records and supporting documents until the audit procedure AND its follow-up (including
rejection, grant reduction, recovery and litigation) are completed.
Example: If the beneficiary archives the paper copies of the original supporting documentation not on
its premises, the documentation must be retrieved and sent there in time for the audit fieldwork.
Audits normally focus the financial implementation of the action by a beneficiary (i.e. financial
and budgetary implementation), but they may also cover technical aspects or compliance
with other obligations under the Grant Agreement (i.e. an in-depth examination of the
implementation of the action by the beneficiary). This examination is carried out by
professional (external or granting authority in -house) auditors according to generally
accepted audit standards.
They may also extend to other participants involved in the action — which is why
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights also towards
those other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients
263EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
of financial support to third parties (FSTP) and, for HE, also third parties providing in-kind
contributions) by including appropriate clauses in their contracts with them, see Articles 8
and 9.
With the exception of affiliated entities (who are usually audited directly; see specific cases
below), the audit procedure for any third party will formally be with the beneficiary and the
beneficiary will be responsible for ensuring that the auditors have access to all necessary
documents and to carry out checks on the third party’s premises.
If the audit shows, ineligible costs or contributions, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud
or serious breach of obligations, this may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection,
grant reduction and recovery (see Articles 30, 31, 32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and, in very serious
cases, to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see Article 34). In some cases, findings may
result in the acceptance of additional costs (if the beneficiary declared them).
Specific cases (audits):
Affiliated entities — In contrast to other third parties, the granting authority will audit
affiliated entities, as if they are beneficiaries. The audit will be carried out on the premises of
the affiliated entity and all communication concerning the audit will be carried out directly
with it (e.g. audit initiation letter, contradictory audit procedure; audit result
implementation). However, since the financial consequences in case of recovery would
normally have to be borne by the beneficiary to which the entity is affiliated (see Article
22.2), the granting authority will also notify the beneficiary about launching the audit, as well
as about a summary of its conclusions.
Audits for periodical assessment of eligible costs or contributions based on units,
lump sums and flat rates — The European Commission may also audit the accounting
records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost items for which
it has fixed unit costs or contributions, flat-rates or lump-sums (for statistical purposes or to
gather data to assess their adequacy). Such audits will normally have no direct consequences
for the beneficiaries that were audited; even if the actual costs turn out to be lower, this will
not lead to a rejection of costs (— except in exceptional cases e.g. where the audit reveals
non-compliance with other obligations, e.g. under national law or wrongful information in the
proposal, etc).
2. Procedure
How? The audit will be initiated by a letter of announcement (LoA) sent to the beneficiary
(or affiliated entity) concerned through the Portal.
If the granting authority uses an external audit firm, this letter will mention its name. The
beneficiary may object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interests
(together with the reasons why) and — if justified — the granting authority may decide to
appoint another external auditor (or, in exceptional circumstances, to carry out the audit
itself).
The audit usually involves a desk review of the documents requested from the beneficiary
and an on-the-spot visit (i.e. on the beneficiary’s premises or on the site on which the
action is being implemented). There may however also be audits that consist only in a desk
review.
The auditors will request access to a wide range of records and documentation (e.g. payslips,
labour contracts, complete statutory accounts, etc.) and will indicate how and when it must
be provided (and in which format).
The beneficiary must provide the auditors with all requested information, records and
supporting documents (in the format and within the deadline specified).
Example: A hard copy list of records from the general ledger (accounting document) disclosing
hundreds or thousands of transactions is impossible to process manually, therefore the auditors will
normally require an electronic version.
264EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Objections based on data protection or confidentiality will NOT be accepted. Where the
records and documentation contain personal data, the granting authority will process it in
compliance with Regulation 2018/1725 and the beneficiary must inform the persons
concerned about this processing (see Article 15.1).
Confidential data will be processed in accordance with Article 13.
Failure to provide the requested information (in the requested format and within the specified
deadline) will lead to the rejection of costs or contributions (and possibly other measures,
such as recovery, suspension of payments, termination, administrative and financial
penalties, etc.).
For on-the-spot audits, the beneficiary must allow access to its premises and ensure that all
records and supporting documentation are readily available. This includes granting access to
research facilities and interviewing the researchers that worked on the action.
The results of the audit will be recorded in an audit report.
The draft audit report will be sent to the beneficiary concerned, who will have 30 days to
submit observations (contradictory audit procedure; not to be confused with the separate
contradictory procedure for any subsequent rejection or grant reduction under Articles 27 and
28).
The audit procedure will be closed (by the granting authority auditors) with the final audit
report and the audit letter of conclusion (LoC) — and the file will then be passed on to
the granting authority for the follow-up, if any.
Please do NOT take any immediate action at this point — even if the audit found ineligible
costs/breaches. Do NOT deduct them from the next financial statement. The proposed
adjustments must first be analysed and will, if needed, be implemented by the granting authority
at the next payment. You will be informed by payment letter/audit implementation pre-information
letter and have another possibility to submit observations.

General > Article 25.2 Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting authorities
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights of checks,
reviews and audits as the granting authority.
1. Checks, reviews and audits (by the European Commission)
EU grants are often not managed by the European Commission itself, but by legally separate
entities such as EU executive agencies or joint undertakings. The European Commission is in
these cases not the granting authority but does retain equivalent rights for checks, reviews
and audits.
Where the European Commission conducts such a check, review or audit of an action of
another granting authority, the guidance provided above applies mutatis mutandis, see
Articles 25.1.1, 25.1.2, 25.1.3.

25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the periodic
assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.
1. Access to assess simplified forms of funding (by the European Commission)
The European Commission may access the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain
general information about real costs of cost items for which it has fixed unit costs or
contributions, flat-rates or lump-sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data to assess
their adequacy). Such access will normally have no direct consequences for the beneficiaries.
Even if the actual costs turn out to be lower than the simplified form of funding, this will not
lead to a rejection of costs.

25.4 OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
The following bodies may also carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations — during the action or
afterwards:
- the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) under Regulations No 883/201344 and No 2185/9645
- the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) under Regulation 2017/1939
- the European Court of Auditors (ECA) under Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU
(TFEU) and Article 263 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If requested by these bodies, the beneficiary concerned must provide full, accurate and complete information
in the format requested (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data,
including in electronic format) and allow access to sites and premises for on-the-spot visits or inspections —
as provided for under these Regulations.
To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the action, at least until
the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until any ongoing checks, reviews, audits,
investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have been concluded.

15/11/1996, p. 2).
1. OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
In addition to the granting authority and the European Commission, you can also have a
check, review, audit or investigation from any of the following:
− the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF): OLAF is the EU’s anti-fraud office,
responsible for investigating fraud against the EU budget.
If the granting authority suspects that a beneficiary or third party involved in an
action committed fraud or other illegal acts, it will inform OLAF (and/or EPPO), who
may decide to investigate.
OLAF will send the outcome of the investigation to the granting authority, who will
then decide how to proceed.
− the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO): EPPO is an independent and
decentralised prosecution office of the European Union, with the competence to
investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment crimes against the EU budget, such as
fraud, corruption or serious cross-border VAT fraud.
− the European Court of Auditors (ECA): ECA is the independent external auditing
body for all European institutions. As such, it may carry out audits on all recipients of
EU funds (including beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners,
subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) and, for HE,
also third parties providing in-kind contributions).
268EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Depending on the outcome, the results of such an audit may be notified to the
beneficiary.
These bodies are not subject to the time-limits for audits and reviews set out in the Data
Sheet (Point 6) for the granting authority. They may carry out their activities at any point
during or after the action.
If the check, review, audit or investigation shows ineligible costs or contributions,
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations, it may lead
to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant reduction and recovery (see Articles 30, 31,
32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and, in very serious cases, to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see
Article 34).

25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant may lead to
rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount (see Article
22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may lead to a request
for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach
of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal prosecution under
national law.
1. Consequences of findings in this grant and extension to other grants
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to any of the measures described in Chapter 5 (i.e. cost rejections, grant
reductions, suspension, termination, etc).
If they find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations, this
may also lead to consequences in other EU grants awarded under similar conditions
(‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings leading to OLAF or EPPO investigations may also lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.

General > Article 25.5.2 Extension from other grants
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Results of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar conditions, to have
committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations that have a
material impact on this grant and
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the list of grants
affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to extend the findings
and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of costs or contributions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or recurrent errors, to
calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or recurrent errors
and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations, revised financial
statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the implementation (i.e.
start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the revised financial statements or the
announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see Articles 27 and 28).
1. Extension of findings from other grants
Findings from other EU grants may also impact the grant. Article 25.5.2 alloIhe granting
authority to apply measures (e.g. cost rejection or grant reduction) , if there were issues in
other EU grants in which the beneficiary participates or participated (i.e. including past
grants), provided that the extension is notified within the audit time limit (see DataSheet,
Point 6), and the findings have:
− ‘systemic or recurrent’ nature, meaning not just an individual occurrence in one
other grant but something expected to affect all similar activities of the beneficiary
also in other grants
Example (extension): During an audit of another grant, the granting authority detected
systematic irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs (e.g. recurrent errors in the time-
recording systems for personnel). The beneficiary has used the same practice in all EU grants.
271EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘similar conditions’, meaning that the other grant contains obligations that are
similar enough to the obligations of the present grant that errors in the other grant
would also be errors under the rules of the present grant.
Example (no extension): During an audit of the beneficiary’s participation in another grant,
the granting authority detected recurrent errors in the record of actual cost for travel and
subsistence. However, in the present grant the beneficiary uses unit cost for travel and
subsistence. Therefore other rules apply an errors in the actual cost do not affect the unit cost
under the present grant (in this case).
− ‘material impact on this grant’, meaning that findings in other grants must be
relevant in the context of implementation of the present grant, i.e. leading to a
measurable error.
Example (no extension): During an audit of another grant, the granting authority detected
systematic (accidental) errors in the calculation of depreciation of equipment of the beneficiary.
While the present grant follows the same cost eligibility rules on equipment, the beneficiary has
only declared personnel and subcontracting costs for the implementation of the present grant.
Therefore, findings on equipment costs in other grants have no impact on the present grant.
2. Procedure
How? The audit extension procedure will be initiated as part of the letter of audit
conclusions (LoC) and the beneficiary concerned will be asked to provide further
documents and information and observations.
Once the necessary documents and information are received, the audit extension procedure
will be closed (by the granting authority auditors) with the audit extension complete
letter — and the file will then be passed on to the granting authorities of the concerned
projects for the follow-up, if any.
Please do NOT take any immediate action at this point. The proposed extensions must
first be analysed and will, if needed, be implemented by the granting authorities of the
concerned projects. You will be informed by payment letter/audit implementation pre-
information letter and have another possibility to submit observations.

General > Article 25.5.2 Consequences of non-compliance
25.5.2 Consequences of non-compliance
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions insufficiently
substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 27), and the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Refusal to give access for checks, reviews, audits or investigations
The beneficiaries (and through Article 9 also the other partners involved in the action) are
obliged to give access to the granting authority/Commission/OLAF/EPPO/ECA for the checks,
reviews, audits and investigations set out in Article 25 of the Grant Agreement.
If they refuse such access or otherwise intentionally and without proper justification resist a
check, review, audit or investigation, this constitutes a breach of the Grant Agreement.
The consequences depend on the case. If the refusal means that certain costs or
contributions could not be verified (and are thus insufficiently substantiated), they will be
considered ineligible and rejected (see Article 27). In addition (or if there is no impact on
specific costs or contributions), the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).

ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the objectives and
indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or beneficiaries and will be
considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact of the action,
including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may apply the
measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Impact evaluations
In principle, for 2021-2027, all programmes measure the impact of the actions through the
key performance indicators (KPIs) that are collected as part of the continuous reporting.
The formal evaluation procedure set out in this provision is therefore currently not in active
use by any of the programmes using the General Model Grant Agreement. If needed, the
granting authority will provide guidance directly to the beneficiaries.

CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
General > Article 27 — Rejection of costs/contributions
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at beneficiary termination, interim payment, final payment or afterwards —
reject any costs or contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in particular following checks, reviews,
audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant (see Article 25).
Ineligible costs or contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the coordinator or
beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary
concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the
rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory procedure with pre-
information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions, it will deduct them from the costs or contributions
declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
1. Rejection of costs or contributions
What? If the granting authority finds ineligible costs or contributions (in particular,
following a check, audit, extension of audit findings, review or investigation), it will reject
them (— in full, i.e. for the amount that is ineligible).
Grounds for cost or contribution rejection (by the EU):
▪ Costs or contributions do not comply with the Grant Agreement’s general
eligibility rules, see Article 6.1
▪ Costs or contributions do not comply with the Grant Agreement’s specific
eligibility rules, see Article 6.2
▪ Costs or contributions fall under the categories of ineligible costs or
contributions, see Article 6.3.
Whereas rejection will usually be based on findings of the granting authority under the
respective grant, it may also happen that costs or contributions are rejected based on
extension of audit findings (see Article 25.5) from other grants, if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or similar rules
applicable)
275EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the ineligibility is:
− systemic or recurrent, and
− has a material impact across grants.
When? Rejection of costs or contributions can take place at any moment — at the time of
beneficiary termination, interim payment, payment of the balance or afterwards (e.g.
following ex-post audits).
Cost or contributions must comply with general and specific eligibility conditions and not
fall under the categories of ineligible cost. Any cost or contributions that do not comply with
all of these conditions may be rejected (see Article 6).
2. Procedure
How? The beneficiaries will be informed about the cost rejections and given the opportunity
to submit their observations.
Formally speaking, the procedure is slightly different:
− if rejection leads to a recovery: the procedure is a standard contradictory
procedure
− if rejection does NOT lead to a recovery (just a decreased payment): the procedure is
apayment review procedure.
The difference in the two procedures is in the timing. In case of recoveries, there is nothing
to pay out, so the procedure foresees a standard contradictory procedure. In case of positive
amount to pay, the procedure switches to the payment review procedure in order to allow the
granting authority to immediately pay out undisputed amounts and focus the
observations/review on the disputed amounts.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Payment review procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator about the rejection of costs or
contributions and notifies the amounts that will be paid out (notification of
amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Step 2 — If the beneficiaries disagree, the coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days
to inform the granting authority of its objections.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the request for review and informs the
coordinator of its outcome.
Depending on the moment when costs or contributions are rejected, this procedure will be
directed either at the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
276EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for rejections at the time of an interim payment or the final payment: normally the
coordinator
− for rejections after beneficiary termination and after final payment: normally the
beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries
concerned via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of
delivery, etc) and ask for their comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries.
If it is directed at the beneficiary during the action, the granting authority will inform the
coordinator later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality). Beneficiaries should inform
their coordinator if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action (see Article 19.3).
If it is directed at the beneficiary after the action, beneficiaries do not have to inform their
coordinators or ask them to submit comments.
3. Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions at beneficiary termination, it will
deduct the rejected amount from the costs or contributions that the beneficiary declared in
the termination report and calculate the amount due to the beneficiary. If the amount is
lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary, the
granting authority will recover the difference (see Article 22.3.2).
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions at the moment of an interim
payment or the final payment, it will deduct them and calculate the amount to be paid
accordingly (see Articles 22.3.3 and 22.3.4).
If ineligible costs or contributions are found in-between payments, the granting authority
will reject them at the next payment (i.e. deduct the amount rejected from the amounts
declared in the next financial statement and calculate the amount to be paid accordingly; see
Article 22).
If the granting authority rejects costs after the final payment, it will deduct the amount
rejected from the amounts accepted for the beneficiary at the final payment and calculate a
revised final grant amount for the beneficiary. This may be followed by a recovery if
needed (see Article 22.3.5).
277EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 28 — Grant reduction
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — reduce the grant for
a beneficiary, if:
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including improper
implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics or security rules (if
applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant (see Article 25).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and proportionate to the
seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, by applying an
individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the coordinator
or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the reasons why. The coordinator or
beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — submit observations if it disagrees
with the reduction (payment review procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory procedure with
pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the amount due
(and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
1.Grant reduction
What? If the granting authority finds (e.g. following a check, audit, extension of audit
findings, review or investigation) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of
obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-compliance with the call
conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach of
ethics, values or security rules, etc) under the Grant Agreement or during the award
procedure, it may reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the finding.
Grant reductions will be made in proportion to the seriousness of the error, irregularity,
fraud or breach (e.g. in case of fraud the reduction may be up to a 100%).
If the issues are found before the end of the action, the beneficiaries must take all
possible corrective steps to bring the action implementation back into line with the Grant
Agreement.
1. The monthly declaration of days worked in the project correctly signed (see Article
20) OR reliable time records will normally be sufficient proof of the assignment to 278
the action — unless there is other contradicting evidence (e.g. the employment
contract indicates that the person was hired to work on another project).EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Grounds for grant reduction:
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may make a grant reduction if a beneficiary has committed
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations — either
during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement.
Serious breach of obligations may cover all kinds of non-compliance with Grant
Agreement obligations (including obligations during the award procedure).
Example: False declarations in the proposal form in order to obtain EU funding.
In practice, the most frequent breach is improper implementation of the
action/non-compliance with Annex 1 (i.e. if the work performed does not
correspond to the activities described in Annex1). This will normally be examined
on the basis of the periodic and final technical reports and, if needed, a project
review.
Breaches of other obligations, such as the obligation to respect and commit to EU
values (see Article 14), may also lead to grant reductions.
Example: A non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless of religious
or political background released very controversial statements of xenophobic nature, in
particular by calling to destroy country X. One of the activities which was supposed to be
implemented by the entity was cancelled by the subcontractor because of these
statements. In the specific context of the action in question , these statements were
considered a breach of the obligation to respect EU values (non-discrimination). This
conduct led to a reduction of the grant amount (among other measures).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also make a grant reduction, if such substantial errors,
irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants,
if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
When? Grant reductions will be made at beneficiary termination, at the end of the action or
after the payment of the balance.
2. Procedure
How? The beneficiaries will be informed about the grant reductions and given the
opportunity to submit their observations.
Formally speaking, the procedure is slightly different:
− if reduction leads to a recovery: the procedure is a standard contradictory
procedure
− if reduction does NOT lead to a recovery (just a decreased payment): the procedure is
apayment review procedure.
279EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The difference in the two procedures is in the timing. In case of recoveries, there is nothing
to pay out, so the procedure foresees a standard contradictory procedure. In case of positive
amount to pay, the procedure switches to the payment review procedure in order to allow the
granting authority to immediately pay out undisputed amounts and focus the
observations/review on the reduction.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Payment review procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator about the reduction and notifies
the amounts that will be paid out (notification of amounts due; see Article
22.3).
Step 2 — If the beneficiaries disagree, the coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days
to inform the granting authority of its objections.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the request for review and informs the
coordinator of its outcome.
Depending on the moment when reduction takes place, this procedure will be directed either
at the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
− for reductions at the time of the final payment: normally the coordinator
− for reductions after beneficiary termination and after final payment: normally the
beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries
concerned via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of
delivery, etc.) and ask for their comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries.
If it is directed at the beneficiary during the action, the granting authority will inform the
coordinator later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality). Beneficiaries should inform their
coordinator if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action (see Article 19.3).
If it is directed at the beneficiary after the action, beneficiaries do not have to inform their
coordinators or ask them to submit comments.
3. Effects
If the granting authority makes a reduction at beneficiary termination, it will deduct the
reduction from the accepted EU contribution based on the costs or contributions that the
beneficiary declared in the termination report and calculate the amount due to the
beneficiary. If the amount is lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by
the beneficiary, the granting authority will recover the difference (see Article 22.3.2).
If the granting authority makes a reduction at the final payment, it will deduct them and
calculate the amount to be paid accordingly (see Article 22.3.4).
If the granting authority makes a reduction after the final payment, it will deduct the
amount reduced from the accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary at the final payment
280EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
and calculate a revised final grant amount. This may be followed by a recovery if needed
(see Article 22.3.5).

SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
General > Article 29 — Payment deadline suspension
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment cannot be
processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or additional
information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing audit extension procedure, queries about
eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations
are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — and
the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to confirm if the
suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the revised report is
not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority may also terminate the grant or
the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. Suspension of the payment deadline (by the EU)
What? The granting authority must make its payments in accordance with the timeline set
out in the Data Sheet (usually 30 days from grant signature/start of project for initial
prefinancing and 60 or 90 days from reception of the additional pre-financing/periodic report.
If the deadline is missed, late payment interest will be due by the granting authority (see
below and Article 22.5) — unless the payment deadline has been suspended.
Suspension of the payment deadline must be distinguished from suspension of
payments (see Article 30). Suspension of the payment deadline is an ad hoc measure
regarding a pending payment. Suspension of payments is independent of any individual
payment request as a measure to stop making payments to a beneficiary which is, for
example, suspected of serious misconducts.
The payment deadline may be suspended temporarily on the grounds listed in this Article.
Grounds for suspension of the payment deadline (by the EU):
282EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Payment request is incomplete or requires clarification.
The granting authority may suspend the payment deadline, if the reports (or any
of their documents) are incomplete or unclear and the granting authority is
therefore not in a position to determine that the action has been properly
implemented and the payment is due.
Examples: the reports, the certificate on the financial statement or other supporting
documents are missing; the information in the periodic technical report is incomplete;
additional information on the coordinator’s new bank account is needed
▪ Doubts on the amount to be paid in the financial statements that require
additional verifications.
The granting authority may suspend the payment deadline, if it has doubts (e.g.
due to conflicting information between documents, or audit findings in other grants
on the eligibility of the costs in the financial statements) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are needed to establish the amount to be paid.
Example: The costs claimed in the financial statements are not consistent with the action
tasks described in the technical report.
▪ There are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
The granting authority may also suspend the payment deadline, if it has other
doubts on the eligibility of payment claims. It will request the necessary
information or enact other measures including by means of on-the-spot-checks if
necessary.
Example: The granting authority has received information that parts of the activities are
not properly implemented and subject to fraud.
2. Procedure
How? The granting authority will inform the coordinator of the suspension of the payment
deadline and explain the reasons why.
There is NO contradictory procedure for the suspension itself. However, if the suspension
exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the granting authority if the suspension is to
be continued (i.e. ask to confirm it or lift it). In addition, a contradictory procedure/payment
review will be available later on if the granting authority should eventually decide to dispute
amounts and make rejections/grant reductions).
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the day the notification (announcing payment deadline suspension) is
sent to the coordinator (and ends on the day it is lifted).
As soon as the suspension is started, passing days do no longer count towards the 60 or 90
day deadline set out in the DataSheet and accordingly no late-payment interest for the
beneficiaries will accrue. With the lifting of the suspension, the remaining payment period
starts to run again (as from the day-count on which the suspension started).
If the issues have been resolved satisfactorily (e.g. the coordinator sent the requested
information or re-submitted the report) or the granting authority has finished the necessary
verifications (e.g. an audit), it will lift the suspension and inform the coordinator.
If a deadline has been suspended for several reasons, it will be lifted only when the
consortium has satisfactorily addressed ALL the reasons.

General > Article 30 — Payment suspension
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for one or more
beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is suspected of having
committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including improper
implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics or security rules (if
applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant.
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make partial payment(s)
for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the payment (or recovery) of the
remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary
concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally
notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting authority will
formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the suspension end date.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For interim payments,
the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article 21) must not contain any
financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated entities). The coordinator must include
them in the next periodic report after the suspension is lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of
the action — in the last periodic report.
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. Suspension of payments (by the EU)
284EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What? The granting authority may suspend pre-financing, interim and final payments (for
one or more beneficiaries), on the grounds listed in this Article.
Suspension of payments has NO impact on the action implementation. The beneficiary
concerned must continue to work on the action, while addressing the issues that have led to
suspension of the payment; costs incurred during suspension of payments are in principle
eligible, but there will be no payments.
Grounds for suspension of payments (by the EU):
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may suspend payments, if a beneficiary has committed or is
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious
breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-
compliance with the call conditions, submission of false information, failure to
provide required information, breach of ethics, values or security rules, etc) —
either during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement.
Example:
1. False declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding
2. Based on information received from a third party, the granting authority suspects that
the beneficiary and the person who has powers of control towards the beneficiary are in
breach of EU values. The information received indicates that public statements which are
discriminatory and incite hate towards women have been made by the person who controls
the beneficiary. The granting authority suspended payments to the beneficiary until it
confirmed that the allegations were not supported by reliable evidence.
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also suspend payments, if such substantial errors,
irregularities- or, fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants,
if
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of
obligations are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systemic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other Grant
Agreements signed by the audited beneficiary. The grating authority may suspend all
outstanding payments for the audited beneficiary until the issue is resolved.
2. Procedure
How? Before suspending payments, the granting authority will follow a contradictory
procedure to give the beneficiary the possibility to submit observations.Contradictory
procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the beneficiary concerned of its intention (and
the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
285EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 — The beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An extension
may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the day the notification (confirming suspension) is sent to the
beneficiary concerned (and ends on the day it is lifted).
During suspension, NO individual financial statements may be submitted for the beneficiary
(or beneficiaries) concerned with the periodic reports (except with the report for the final
reporting period).
Costs incurred (for continuing to implement the action during suspension) are eligible and
may be included in the next financial report, after suspension has been lifted. At the latest,
they must be included in the periodic report for the final reporting period (— even if
suspension is still ongoing).
Technical reports submitted during suspension must include the work of the beneficiaries
concerned.
If payments for one (or some) of the beneficiaries are still suspended at the end of the
action, the granting authority will make a partial payment of the balance for the amount that
is not suspended (— but ONLY after having received all the necessary information for the
final calculations for ALL consortium members, i.e. including the suspended beneficiaries).
The partial final payment that will be paid out in this case is NOT the payment that
closes the action for the purposes of the deadlines set out in Point 6 of the Data Sheet. That
payment will be made only after the payment suspensions are lifted.

ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances — in
particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
− the reasons why
− the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request and
− the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately request another
amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption date (one day after suspension
end date), extend the duration and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see
Article 39) — unless the grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect
from the suspension end date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of
the amendment request.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for activities
implemented during grant suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. GA suspension (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the ground set out in
this Article.
GA suspension may be used exceptionally if it is necessary to stop the action
implementation, to fix specific problems. It should NOT be used in situations that cannot
be resolved through a temporary interruption of the project activities; in these cases, it may
be better to terminate the Grant Agreement (see Article 32).
Ground for GA suspension (by the Consortium):
▪ Action can no longer be implemented (or becomes excessively difficult)
The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), if implementation
becomes impossible or excessively difficult.
Example: A fire devastates a beneficiary’s premises, with most of the technical equipment
and computers used for the action and containing the action results. The beneficiaries
287EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
therefore request that the part of the action that is affected by this is suspended until the
premises are restored.
Information obligation — Depending on the reasons for suspension, the beneficiaries may
also have to take other measures under the Grant Agreement (e.g. inform the granting authority
under Article 19; notify a situation of force majeure under Article 35).
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the date the suspension takes effect (this date may be before the date of the
submission of the amendment request) and the expected date of resumption.
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the date specified in the amendment request.
The beneficiaries must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit the damage and do
their best to resume (i.e. continue) implementing the action as soon as possible.
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are
NOT eligible (see Article 6.3). Costs may again be incurred for the action, once action
implementation is resumed.
If the action can be continued (resumed), the coordinator must notify it to the granting
authority by requesting an amendment to the Grant Agreement.
The resumption amendment must again be requested in accordance with Article 39 (e.g. it
must be signed by the coordinator’s LSIGN).
It sets the resumption date and adapts the grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the
action duration, modifying Annexes 1 and 2, updating the reporting periods).
If the granting authority approves the resumption amendment, the suspension is lifted and
will be resumed as from the resumption date (i.e. one day after the suspension end date set
in the amendment, which can be retroactive, i.e. back to the date when the problem
stopped/issue was clarified).
Example: The action was suspended on 24.03.2023 due to an extreme weather event affecting the
premises of the coordinator and making continuous implementation of the action temporarily
unfeasible. After two months of clearing efforts, the conditions improve and the coordinator’s
premises are accessible again. The coordinator requests an amendment to set the suspension end
date on 22.05.2023. Therefore, the action will be resumed as from 23.05.2023.
If the suspension is lifted and the action resumes, the action’s remaining budget can be used
for action implementation.
If a part of the action cannot be implemented anymore (e.g. due to impossibility following the
circumstances causing the suspension), the granting authority may agree to amend the Grant
Agreement with changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation, including by
decreasing activities and budget unless changes are so significant that they call into question
the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment (see below and
Article 39).
288EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the action or a significant part of it can NOT be continued (or the granting authority does
not approve the amendment; see Article 39), the Grant Agreement (or the participation of
one or more beneficiaries) may be terminated.
In this case, NO further costs (incurred after the date of suspension) can be declared, except
the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1).
Example: The action starts on 01.01.2022 and is to last 36 months. The action’s implementation is
suspended for four months, from the date specified in the amendment request, e.g. 01.12.2022 to
31.03.2023 and the suspension leads to the Grant Agreement termination. The eligible costs are:
− costs incurred from the action’s start (01.01.2022) until the date specified in the
amendment request (30.11.2022)
− costs incurred for the submission of the first periodic report and the final report.

improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions,
submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach of
ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits
and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant

2 if selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as specified in
Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute, and this impacts the
implementation of the action under this Agreement]]
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: additional GA suspension grounds: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with additional GA suspension grounds: [additional GA suspension grounds:
insert other grounds]].
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally
notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date specified
in the notification).
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority will formally
notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the suspension end date and invite
the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to set the resumption date (one day after
suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new
situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be
lifted with effect from the suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be
before the date on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for activities
implemented during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a beneficiary (see
Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
290EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. GA suspension (by the EU)
What? The granting authority may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the grounds
listed in this Article.
Grounds for GA suspension (by the EU):
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may suspend the action, if a beneficiary (or one of its
person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or one of its
person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious
breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-
compliance with the call conditions, submission of false information, failure to
provide required information, breach of ethics, values or security rules, etc) —
either during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement
Examples:
1. False declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding
2. Based on information received from a third party, the granting authority suspects that
the beneficiary and the person who has powers of control towards the beneficiary are in
breach of EU values. The information received indicates that public statements which are
discriminatory and incite to hate towards women have been made by the person who
controls the beneficiary. The granting authority suspended the Grant Agreement
implementation until it confirmed that the allegations were not supported by reliable
evidence.
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also suspend the action, if a beneficiary (or one of its
person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or one of its
person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations in other
grants, if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systematic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other Grant Agreements
signed by the audited beneficiary. The granting authority may suspend the audited
beneficiary’s part of the action until the issue is resolved.
291EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ If provided in the Grant Agreement: the linked action (see Article 3) has not
started as specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute
and this impacts the implementation of the action under the Grant Agreement.
▪ Depending on the programme and on the type of action, there may be other
specific grounds for suspension of the Grant Agreement by the granting
authority, for example:
− major delays (CEF, RENEWFM, JTM)
− loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost scientific or technological relevance.
Example: A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered
material is selected. After the action starts, a European scientific publication
demonstrates that this material contains a chemical substance that irremediably
harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot continue and the granting
authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
− loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its economic relevance
− loss of relevance as being part of a given portfolio (HE-challenge-
based EIC Pathfinder actions and Missions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially
selected.
− change of humanitarian context no longer allows the
implementation of the action (HUMA)
− suspension or termination of the cooperation or of the Financing
Agreement with the partner country in which the project takes
place (RELEX)
− change of partner country policy environment (RELEX).
Specific cases (GA suspension by the EU):
Loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE) — The granting authority may suspend
the action, if it needs time to assess whether the action has lost scientific or technological
relevance. This may in particular be the case:
− if a complete revision of Annex 1 is necessary to assess the impact of a request for
amendment
− if work has significantly deviated from the original work plan
− if a key beneficiary leaves the action and the consortium needs time to find a
replacement
− after a check, audit or review of the action.
Example: There are technical problems with implementing the work under an action as
described in Annex 1, so the consortium proposes changes to the work to be carried out. This
may jeopardise its technological relevance and the granting authority decides to suspend its
implementation and to carry out a review.
292EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions) — The granting authority may suspend the
action, if the action has lost its economic relevance.
Loss of relevance as being part of a portfolio (HE-challenge-based EIC Pathfinder actions
and Missions) — The granting authority may suspend the action, if the action has lost its
relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially selected.
2. Procedure
How? Before suspending the Grant Agreement, the granting authority will follow a
contradictory procedure to give the consortium the possibility to submit observations.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator of its intention (and the reasons
why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator has 30 days to submit observations. An extension may be
granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
If possible, the granting authority will give an estimation of how long the suspension will be
needed.
3. Effects
The suspension starts the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date
specified in the confirmation notification).
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are
NOT eligible (see Article 6.3). Eligible costs may again be incurred and declared for the
action, once the suspension is lifted.
If the action can be continued, the granting authority will lift the suspension and inform the
coordinator (together with the suspension end date).
The suspension can be lifted retroactively (i.e. back to the date when the problem
stopped/issue was clarified).
The coordinator must then request an amendment to the Grant Agreement (see Article 39),
to set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date) in the tools and adapt the
grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the action duration modifying Annexes 1 and 2,
updating the reporting periods).
If the action (or part of it) can NOT be continued, the Grant Agreement (or a beneficiary’s
participation) may be terminated.
If the suspension leads to the Grant Agreement termination, NO further costs (incurred after
the date of suspension) can be declared, except the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1).
Ineligible costs will be rejected. The grant may be reduced, if the termination is based on
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations (for instance if the
action has not been implemented properly; see Article 28). In certain cases, the granting
authority may also impose administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion and/or financial penalties;
see Article 34).

General > Article 32.1 — GA termination by consortium
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the date of the
submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify termination, it may
consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a periodic report (for
the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of the report
submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented before the
end of work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after the end of work are
not eligible.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and contributions which
are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no costs/contributions if no periodic
report was ever approved).
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and security), 16
(IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and
investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 41 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
1. GA termination (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries have the right to terminate the Grant Agreement.
GA termination should be a last-resort measure, if all efforts to continue the action fail.
If the action implementation just becomes temporarily impossible or excessively difficult, it
may be better not to terminate the grant, but to suspend it (see Article 31). In this case, the
Grant Agreement would only be terminated if it turns out later that implementation cannot be
resumed anymore.
294EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: A fire devastates premises where most of the technical equipment and computers used in
the action are stored. If the beneficiaries consider that the premises can be replaced and the action
will still be correctly implemented, they may suspend implementation and resume it when the new
laboratory is operational. However, if the action has been suspended and it is not possible to find
new premises and therefore it is impossible to resume the action, the beneficiaries may terminate
the Grant Agreement.
Grounds for GA termination (by the Consortium):
▪ Any ground that justifies early termination of the action
The beneficiaries may terminate the Grant Agreement in principle on any ground
— as long as there is a good reason (e.g. circumstances make its implementation
impossible or excessively difficult; loss of the action’s scientific or technological
relevance; force majeure).
Even if there are no legitimate reasons for discontinuing the action, the granting authority
can NOT oppose, but termination will be considered improper.
Improper termination of the Grant Agreement may lead to a grant reduction (see
Article 28).
This will be the case, for instance, if:
− the implementation of the action has become impossible or excessively difficult due to
the beneficiaries’ wilful misconduct or gross negligence
− the reasons provided are based on changes in the strategic choices of the
beneficiaries, not linked to any specific economic or operational difficulties
− implementation would have been possible if the beneficiaries had made more (but still
reasonable) efforts.
Example: The beneficiaries decide to terminate the Grant Agreement due to internal
communication and decision-making problems within the consortium, and notify the granting
authority via the coordinator. The granting authority considers that these internal problems have
jeopardised the action’s implementation, but do not justify terminating the Grant Agreement
because they could have been solved within the consortium on the basis of the consortium
agreement. This improper termination may lead to a grant reduction.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the granting authority beforehand, to discuss
the termination and possible alternatives.
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
− the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request. Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
3. Effects
295EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit the necessary reports (i.e. a periodic
report for the open reporting period until termination).
If the coordinator fails to submit the reports (within the 60 days of the date on which
termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial report
will NOT be taken into account when the final grant amount is calculated. The granting
authority will NOT send a reminder and will NOT extend the deadline.
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and the payment of the balance
(see Article 22).
If the total amount of earlier payments (pre-financing payment and interim payments, if any)
received before termination:
− is greater than the final grant amount, the balance is negative and will take the form
of a recovery (see Article 22.2)
− is lower than the final grant amount, the granting authority will pay the balance (see
Article 22.3.4).
Only costs incurred before the end of work date (i.e. generating event before the end of work
date; see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:
− costs for the reports (see Article 6.1)
Example: The action’s duration is 36 months. The starting date is 01.01.2022. The notified end
of work date is 01.05.2023. Therefore, only costs incurred in connection with the action from
1.1.2022 to 1.5.2023 (16 months) and the costs related to submission of the periodic report for
the last reporting period are eligible
− costs for (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before the end of work date
(see Article 6.1).
Example: One of the beneficiaries of the Grant Agreement has a contract to carry out 8 tests
during the action’s duration. However, only three tests out of 8 are carried out before the end of
work date. Therefore, only the costs related to these 3 tests carried out before the end of work
date may be eligible for the action.
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
Termination has NO effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action.
Obligations that continue to apply after GA termination:
▪ Keeping records and other supporting documentation (see Article 20)
▪ Submitting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination)
(see Articles 32.1.2 and 21.2)
▪ Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (e.g.
for checks, reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact;
see Articles 25 and 26)
▪ Complying with the rules on management of intellectual property, background and
results (see Article 16 and Annex 5 > IPR)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security)
▪ Complying with the security obligations (if applicable) (see Article 13 and Annex 5
> Confidentiality and security)
296EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Promoting the action and giving visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17 and
Annex 5 > Communication, dissemination and visibility)
▪ No assignment of claims for payment (see Article 42)

General > Article 32.2 — Beneficiary termination by consortium
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, on request of
the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the date of the
submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment request must
be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify termination, it
may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until
termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial statement, the
explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on the financial statement
(CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed (e.g.
reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary; addition of a
new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the report submitted
and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented before the end of
work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after the end of work are not
eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next reporting
period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the deadline, it
will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
298EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is amended to
introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into question the
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the grant may be
terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant termination (see Article
32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews,
audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 41 (assignment of
claims)) continue to apply.
1. Partner termination (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of the partners (or several),
if:
− the partner concerned can no longer participate or
− the consortium has decided to change the partner (in accordance with the internal
decision-making procedures). In this case, the consortium must inform the beneficiary
concerned, request the beneficiary’s opinion in writing and provide it to the granting
authority (or — if the beneficiary didn’t reply — provide proof that the beneficiary’s
opinion has been requested in writing).
Grounds for partner termination (by the Consortium):
▪ Any ground that justifies termination of the participation of the beneficiary
The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of their consortium
members in principle on any ground — as long as there is a good reason (e.g.
withdrawal by a beneficiary because due to a change in ownership; the beneficiary
cannot implement its tasks in the same way; bankruptcy).
If there are no legitimate reasons, the granting authority will NOT oppose beneficiary
termination, but it will be considered improper.
Improper termination of the participation of a beneficiary may lead to grant reduction
(see Article 28) or even grant termination (see Article 32.3).
Termination extends to affiliated entities. Affiliated entities cannot participate in the action
without the beneficiary they are linked to, therefore, terminating a beneficiary’s participation
implies that its affiliated entities may NOT continue participating in the action.
Best practice: Partner terminations should always be first discussed within the consortium, to
make sure that everybody agrees. In case of conflicts, they should be resolved in accordance
with the consortium agreement. The granting authority will not get involved in internal
disputes; it is the coordinator’s responsibility to handle partner terminations correctly.
299EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For beneficiaries that are involved in several EU Grant Agreements, withdrawal from one
Grant Agreement does NOT necessarily imply that it has to also withdraw from the others.
Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or the
coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority. Late information will be considered
as a breach of the information obligation under the Grant Agreement (see Article 19.4).
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
− the date the beneficiary ends working on the action (‘end of work date’)
− the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request. Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
3. Responsibility
NO amendment is needed if the termination takes effect after the end of the action (and
before payment of the balance) — unless it concerns the coordinator (since the coordinator
has many obligations also after the end of the action, e.g. submit the reports, receive the
payment of the balance and distribute the payment among the beneficiaries).
If it is rejected, the beneficiaries will have to make another proposal to the granting
authority. If a satisfactory solution cannot be found (i.e. the request for an amendment calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of the equal treatment
of applicants), the Grant Agreement may be terminated.
Example: A key beneficiary terminates its participation in the Grant Agreement. The consortium
cannot find a proper replacement and the granting authority therefore considers that the action
cannot be continued in the way for which it was originally awarded the grant.
If the amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Grant Agreement must also be
amended to introduce the necessary changes (including, if necessary, the replacement with
new beneficiaries).
4. Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit the following:
− a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
− a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate
on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
− a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with the other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary;
addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of
coordinator, etc.).
300EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best practice: If possible, the two amendments should be combined and done
together.
In case of coordinator termination, the reports must be submitted by the new
coordinator (to avoid problems with the payment). If the nomination of the new coordinator
takes more time, the 60 days deadline may be extended.
The information contained in the beneficiary’s termination report must also be included in the
periodic report for the next reporting period.
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the terminated beneficiary:
− if the granting authority owes amounts to the beneficiary, those amounts will be paid
with the following payment to the consortium (interim or final)
− if the beneficiary owes, those amounts must be paid back to the consortium.
Only costs incurred before the end of work date (i.e. generating event before the end of work
date see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:
− costs for the termination report (see Article 6.1)
− costs for (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before the end of work date
(see Article 6.1).
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 60 days of the date on
which termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial
report will NOT be taken into account when the contribution is calculated. The granting
authority will NOT send a written reminder and will not extend the deadline.
If the coordinator fails to submit the report on the distribution of payments, the beneficiary
whose participation was terminated will NOT have to repay any amounts to the consortium.
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the Grant Agreement may be terminated (see Article 32).
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action (see Article 32.2). If the second request for amendment is accepted by the
granting authority, the Grant Agreement is amended to introduce the necessary changes (see
Article 39).
If the Grant Agreement continues (i.e. it is amended), the remaining members of the
consortium (and any new beneficiaries) have the responsibility for fully implementing the
action as described in Annex 1 (see Article 7). They must carry out the action (including the
part that the defaulting beneficiary was supposed to carry out and without any additional
funding to do so).
Specific cases (partner termination by the Consortium):
Termination of the coordinator without its agreement — The decision to terminate the
coordinator must be made by the rest of the consortium (according to its internal decision-
making procedures). The notification and amendment request must be made by one of the
beneficiaries (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries; see Article 39) and the reports must
be submitted by the new coordinator (to avoid problems with the payment). If needed, the
60 days deadline for submission of the reports can be extended (see above).
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — In principle the
coordinator must be changed. If the coordinator can no longer submit the request, the same
301EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
procedure as for coordinator termination without its agreement should be used (see above
and Article 39).

(a) one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 40)
(b) a change to the action or the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation of a
beneficiary is likely to substantially affect the implementation of the action or calls into question the
decision to award the grant (including changes linked to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the

(c) following termination of one or more beneficiaries, the necessary changes to the Agreement (and
their impact on the action) would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the

misconduct
(h) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed fraud, corruption, or is involved
in a criminal organisation, money laundering, terrorism-related crimes (including terrorism

32.3.2 Procedure
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will send a
pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will take effect (confirmation
letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also inform the
coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date specified
in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a periodic
report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of the
report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities
implemented before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination are not eligible.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator may not
submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and contributions
which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no costs/contributions
if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 28) or to
impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority (see Article
33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks,
reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and
41 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
304EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on
the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed (e.g.
reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary;
addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of
coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the report
submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented
before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only
after termination are not eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next
reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is amended to
introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into question the
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the grant
may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality
and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 41 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
1. GA or beneficiary termination (by the EU)
What? The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement or the participation of one
(or more) of the beneficiaries, on the grounds listed in this Article.
Beneficiary termination may lead to GA termination, if the granting authority considers
that following such beneficiary termination, the necessary changes to the Grant Agreement
(and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision awarding the grant or
breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants (see Article 32.3.1(c)).
Grounds for termination (by the EU):
▪ Non-accession to the Grant Agreement
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if one (or more)
beneficiaries did not accede to the Grant Agreement (i.e. did not sign the
305EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Accession Form within 30 days after the entry into force of the Grant Agreement or
did not provide the requested declaration on joint and several liability).
Non-accession of a beneficiary does NOT automatically lead to the Grant
Agreement termination; the consortium can find an alternative solution that
ensures the proper implementation of the action without the beneficiary (and
request an amendment; see Article 39).
In this case, the granting authority will terminate the Grant Agreement only if it
considers the solution inappropriate or if the consortium no longer complies with
the eligibility conditions set out in the call conditions (e.g. the rules
regarding the minimum number of beneficiaries, their legal situation, or their place
of establishment).
▪ Change in a beneficiary’s situation
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if there
has been a change to its (or one of its affiliated entities) legal, financial, technical,
organisational or ownership situation, that is likely to substantially affect or delay
the action’s implementation or calls into question the decision to award the grant.
Such changes can be of any kind and can be triggered by the beneficiary itself or
outside circumstances.
Examples (termination):
1. Beneficiary R moves from Europe to Australia and becomes no longer eligible for
receiving EU funding under the programme. Since participants must comply with the
eligibility conditions throughout the duration of the action, this would be a change that calls
into question the decision to award the grant and the granting authority may decide to
terminate the beneficiary’s participation in the Grant Agreement (or the entire Grant
Agreement if the other beneficiaries fail to find a solution to replace it).
2. An action’s key beneficiary is taken over by a non-European company (not entitled to
participate due to security reasons). This substantially affects the action implementation
and the ownership, protection, exploitation and dissemination of the results. The granting
authority decides to terminate the beneficiary’s participation (or the Grant Agreement as a
whole if the other partners fail to find a replacement).
3. A beneficiary becomes subject to EU restrictive measures (or other public law measures
that prohibit the granting authority from providing funding). This means that the beneficiary
is no longer eligible for funding and the granting authority may decide to terminate its
participation (or the Grant Agreement if no other solution can be found).
4. An SME participating as a beneficiary in a grant is acquired by another company.
Following the change of ownership, the beneficiary exceeds the ceilings of the SME
definition and loses its SME status. As one of the awarding conditions to participate in that
mono-beneficiary grant is to be a single start-up or an SME, the change of status calls into
question the decision to award the grant and the Granting Authority decides to terminate
the Grant Agreement.
Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of change of situation that
entails loss of eligibility, e.g. change of ownership, relocation date, etc (see Article 6).
Loss of eligibility may lead to termination by the EU. However, in most cases, the
granting authority will simply ask the consortium to replace the partner by amendment or to
change the partner’s role to associated partner, etc.
▪ Grant Agreement cannot be amended after termination of a beneficiary’s
participation
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if it cannot be
amended after termination of a beneficiary’s participation because the necessary
306EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
changes to the Grant Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of the equal treatment of applicants; see Article 39).
The Grant Agreement may be directly terminated if beneficiary termination
would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
▪ Action can no longer be implemented
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if action
implementation is prevented by force majeure or the action implementation is
suspended and resumption is not possible or the necessary amendment is not
acceptable (see Articles 31 and 39).
Example:
1. A fire devastates premises where most of the technical equipment and computers with
the action’s data are stored. The coordinator suspends the action’s implementation to
rebuild the premises. The granting authority carries out a review after the force majeure
takes place and concludes that the consortium can no longer implement the action. It
therefore decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
2. A beneficiary that has the necessary background to work on the action and owns the
installations where most of the work would be implemented decides to terminate its
participation. The granting authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement because the
remaining consortium cannot continue implementing the action in the same way without
this beneficiary. Continuing the action in a different way then originally evaluated and
ranked would call into question the decision awarding the grant.
▪ Bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors,
suspension of business activities or other similar proceedings
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it is
declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts,
has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities,
or is subject to any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law
(since this normally implies that the beneficiary cannot carry out the work
properly).
Example: A coordinator informs the granting authority that a beneficiary participating in a
Grant Agreement is insolvent. It does not notify beneficiary termination because it thinks
that the beneficiary may continue implementing the action. The granting authority considers
that the beneficiary has not sufficient means to pursue implementation and terminates the
beneficiary’s participation.
Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or
the coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority. Late information will be
considered as a breach of the information obligation under the Grant Agreement (see
Article 19.4).
▪ Non-compliance with tax or social security obligations
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it has
not fulfilled its obligations to pay social security contributions or taxes under
applicable national law (i.e. the law of the country in which it is established and
those of the country(ies) where the action is implemented; see Article 11.1).
Example: A national administration notifies to the granting authority that a beneficiary did
not pay social security contribution for its employees. If this beneficiary cannot prove that it
paid these contributions or clarify the situation within a given deadline, the granting
authority may terminate its participation in the Grant Agreement. If the beneficiary declared
personnel costs including amounts for social security contributions not actually incurred, the
granting authority may furthermore recover any undue amounts.
▪ Grave professional misconduct
307EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
one of its persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or
one of its persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been
found guilty of grave professional misconduct (proven by any means).
‘Grave professional misconduct’ is defined as any type of unacceptable or improper
behaviour in exercising one’s profession, especially by employees, including grave
professional misconduct within the meaning of Article 138(1)(c) of the EU Financial
Regulation 2024/250947 (see Article 2).
According to Article 138(1)(c) of the Financial Regulation, a person or entity is
guilty of grave professional misconduct when it has violated applicable laws or
regulations or ethical standards of the profession to which the person or entity
belongs, or by having engaged in any wrongful conduct which has an impact on its
professional credibility where such conduct denotes wrongful intent or gross
negligence. Therefore, one of the following conditions needs to exist in order for a
conduct to be qualified as grave professional misconduct:
− the entity has violated applicable laws or regulations or ethical standards of
the profession to which it belongs or
− the entity had a wrongful conduct which has an impact on its professional
credibility and the conduct denotes wrongful intent or gross negligence.
The examples given in Article 138(1)(c) FR cover, in particular, violation of ethical
standards of the profession, wrongful conduct with impact on professional
credibility, breach of generally accepted professional ethical standards, false
declarations/misrepresentation of information, participation in a cartel or other
agreement distorting competition, violation of IPR, attempting to influence
decision-making processes by taking advantage, through misrepresentation, of a
conflict of interests, or to obtain confidential information from public authorities to
gain an advantage and incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence or similar
activities contrary to the EU values where negatively affecting or risking to affect
the performance of a legal commitment.
The concept of 'professional misconduct' covers “all wrongful conduct which has an
impact on the professional credibility of the operator at issue and not only the
violations of professional ethical standards in the strict sense of the profession to
which that operator belongs, which are established by the disciplinary body of that
profession or by a judgment which has the force of res judicata"48.
Examples:
1. A legal entity’s participation in a Grant Agreement is terminated when a national
investigation uncovers that it falsified the results of its clinical studies.
2. A non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless of religious or
political background released controversial statements of anti-Semitic nature, in particular
by calling to destroy country X. Expressing the wish to destroy country X was considered a
conduct which has an impact on the integrity and professional credibility of the organisation
and represents a breach of the generally accepted professional ethical standards and of EU
values. The organisation participation in the Grant Agreement was terminated on the
ground of grave professional misconduct.
▪ Fraud, corruption or other criminal activities
47 [old Financial Regulation: Article 136(1)(c) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
48 See Judgment of 13 December 2012, Forpostą SA and ABC Direct Contact sp. z o.o. v Poczta Polska SA, C-
465/11, ECLI:EU:C:2012:801.
308EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
one of its persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or
one of its persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has
committed fraud, corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money
laundering or any other illegal activity.
Example: A legal entity’s participation in several EU projects is terminated when its owner
is convicted by national courts to have participated in large-scale drug trafficking.
▪ Circumvention of fiscal, social or other legal obligations in the country of
origin
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
entities having powers of representation, decision-making or control) was created
under a different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social or other
legal obligations in the country of origin (or one of its persons having powers of
representation, decision-making or control, or one of its persons essential for the
award/implementation of the grant created an entity with this purpose).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement or the participation of
a beneficiary, if a beneficiary (or one of its persons having powers of
representation, decision-making or control, or one of its persons essential for the
award/implementation of the grant) has committed substantial errors,
irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been
properly implemented, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics, values or
security rules, etc) — either during the award procedure or during the action.
Examples:
1. False declarations in the proposal form; coordinator does not transfer payments to the
other beneficiaries, or beneficiaries do not pay their subcontractors; coordinator does not
submit the reports or information (despite a reminder); consortium does not inform the
granting authority about the receipt of a second grant for the same/similar proposal; review
shows that action does not achieve its critical objectives and is way behind schedule and
consortium submits a short-term implementation plan that is not acceptable; audit shows
that beneficiary declared costs based on fake invoices; a check shows that reports
submitted by the consortium were almost entirely copied from the web (plagiarism);
consortium does not submit an amendment request after beneficiary termination
2. A legal entity’s participation in a Grant Agreement is terminated when the granting
authority checks uncovers that the entity made a public speech inciting to hate and
discrimination (breach of obligation to respect EU values in Article 14).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also terminate the Grant Agreement, if a beneficiary
(or one of its person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or one of its person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has
committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of
obligations in other grants, if
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
309EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systematic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that appear intentional and also affect all
other Grant Agreements signed by the audited beneficiary. The granting authority may
terminate the participation of the audited beneficiary in the Grant Agreement.
▪ Non-removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary if it refuses
to remove one of its affiliated entities or an associated partner which is in one of
the following situations:
− bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors,
suspension of business activities or other similar proceedings;
− grave professional misconduct
− non-compliance with tax or social security obligations
− fraud, corruption or other criminal activities
− substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations (in
this grant or other grants).
▪ If provided in the Grant Agreement: the linked action (see Article 3) has not
started as specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can no longer contribute,
and this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement
▪ Depending on the programme and on the type of action, there may be other
specific grounds for termination of the Grant Agreement by the granting
authority, for example:
− major delays (CEF, RENEWFM, JTM)
− loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost scientific or technological relevance.
Example: A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered
material is selected. After the action starts, a European scientific publication
demonstrates that this material contains a chemical substance that irremediably
harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot continue and the granting
authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
− loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its economic relevance
− loss of relevance as being part of a given portfolio (HE-challenge-
based EIC Pathfinder actions and Missions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially
selected.
− change of humanitarian context no longer allows the
implementation of the action (HUMA)
− suspension or termination of the cooperation or of the Financing
Agreement with the partner country in which the project takes
place (RELEX)
− change of partner country policy environment (RELEX).
310EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Before terminating (the Grant Agreement or a beneficiary’s participation), the granting
authority may first suspend the Grant Agreement (see Article 31.2), to try to fix the problems
and re-establish compliance with the Grant Agreement. In this case, it will only terminate
(the Grant Agreement or a beneficiary’s participation) if the action cannot be resumed.
2. Procedure
How? Before GA or beneficiary termination, the granting authority will follow a contradictory
procedure to give the consortium/beneficiary the possibility to submit
observations.Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
Depending on the situation and type of termination, this procedure will be directed either at
the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
− terminations linked to the consortium (e.g. grant termination after a negative project
review): normally the coordinator
− terminations linked to a beneficiary (e.g. beneficiary termination or simultaneous
termination of grants after a beneficiary audit): normally the beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must inform the other beneficiaries, via its
usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc.) and
ask for their comments.
If it is directed at the beneficiary concerned, the granting authority will inform coordinator
later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality).
If a beneficiary is terminated on the basis of Article 32.3.1(e) (i.e. bankruptcy or similar), the
granting authority will also contact the liquidator/administrator (— as soon as possible after
the termination is confirmed).
Information obligation — Beneficiaries should inform their coordinator since beneficiary
termination always has a significant impact on the action (see Article 19), likely requiring a
redistribution of tasks and budget.
3. Effects
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’): Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
The effects of Grant Agreement termination are the same as when the beneficiaries terminate
the Grant Agreement (see Article 32.1.2).
Only costs incurred before termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date;
see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible. Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after
termination are NOT eligible.
Ineligible costs will be rejected. The grant may be reduced, if the termination is based on
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations (for instance if the
action has not been implemented properly; see Article 28). In certain cases, the granting
311EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
authority may also impose administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion and/or financial
penalties; see Article 34).
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action (see Article 32.3.3).
Obligations that continue to apply after GA termination:
▪ Keeping records and other supporting documentation (see Article 20)
▪ Submitting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination)
(see Articles 32.3.3 and 21.2)
▪ Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (e.g.
for checks, reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact;
see Articles 25 and 26)
▪ Complying with the rules on management of intellectual property, background and
results (see Article 16 and Annex 5 > IPR)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security)
▪ Complying with the security obligations (if applicable) (see Article 13 and Annex 5
> Confidentiality and security)
▪ Promoting the action and giving visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17 and
Annex 5 > Communication, dissemination and visibility)
▪ No assignment of claims for payment (see Article 42)

SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND
ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS
General > Article 33 — Liability for damages
ARTICLE 33 — LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to third parties as a
consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross negligence.
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the beneficiaries or other
participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement.
1. Liability for damages (of the EU)
When signing the grant, the beneficiaries agree that the granting authority can NOT be held
liable if — in implementing the Grant Agreement — the granting authority (or its
staff/representatives) cause damage to a beneficiary or third party.
Moreover, the granting authority can NOT be held liable if — in implementing the Grant
Agreement — a beneficiary or third party involved in the action causes damage to another
beneficiary or third party.
Examples:
1. An experiment carried out by a beneficiary leads to an accidental escape of pollutants into the
local river.
2. A fire breaks out in a beneficiary’s laboratory in the course of an experiment for the action
conducted during an audit by the granting authority.
Subsidiary (secondary) liability is also excluded.
The granting authority is also not liable for damages caused by other participants involved in
the action (i.e. affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients of
financial support to third parties (FSTP)).
313EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a result of the
implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full compliance with the
Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.
The liability does not extend to indirect or consequential losses or similar damage (such as loss of profit, loss
of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by wilful act or by a breach of
confidentiality.
1. Liability for damages (of the Consortium)
What? If by implementing the action (or by not implementing the action as agreed) a
beneficiary causes damage to the granting authority, intentionally or as a result of gross
negligence, the granting authority may claim compensation.
Examples:
1. Costs of legal proceedings borne by the granting authority.
2. At a meeting on the granting authority’s premises, a beneficiary smokes and causes a fire.
2. Procedure
How? For liability cases, the granting authority will follow the normal procedure for damages
claims (i.e. bringing an action for contractual damages before the EU courts (General Court)).

General > Article 34 — Administrative sanctions and other measures
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as preventing the adoption of administrative sanctions (i.e.
exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public law measures, in addition or
as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to
148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 2988/9546).
46 Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests
(OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1).
1. Administrative sanctions
What? In the framework of the EU Early Detection and Exclusion System (EDES), the
Financial Regulation 2024/2509provides that the competent EU services can take the
following measures:
− exclusion from participation in award procedures and from being selected for
implementing Union funds, when the beneficiary (or a natural or legal person who is a
member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the beneficiary, a
natural person who is essential for the award or for the implementation of the Grant
Agreement, a natural or legal person that assumes unlimited liability for the debts of
the beneficiary) is in one or more of the exclusion situations mentioned in Article 138
of the Financial Regulation49 (e.g. grave professional misconduct, breach of
obligations, fraud, corruption, irregularity, bankruptcy, etc)
− financial penalties, in the cases described in Article 142 of the Financial Regulation50
(e.g. grave professional misconduct, breach of obligations, fraud, irregularity)
− in order to reinforce the deterrent effect of the above measures, publication of the
information related to the case on the Europa website.
These measures are public law measures (not based on the Grant Agreement) and are
conditional on established facts and findings that are substantiated by reliable evidence (e.g.
OLAF reports; EPPO’s investigations; checks, audit or controls of EU services etc).
When there is only a suspicion of risk threatening the EU financial interests and the relevant
facts are not yet established, the case may be registered in the database for information, to
enable further verifications and reinforced monitoring.
Example: The representative of a non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless
of religious or political background released controversial statements of anti-Semitic nature, in
particular by calling to destroy country X. Expressing the wish to destroy country X is considered a
breach of EU values (non-discrimination) and a grave professional misconduct (a conduct which has
an impact on the integrity and professional credibility of the organisation and represents a breach of
the generally accepted professional ethical standards). The organisation was excluded for a specific
duration from participation in award procedures covered by the general budget of the Union.

315EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Procedure
How? Before taking any of the administrative measures above, the competent EU service will
normally follow a contradictory procedure with the person or entity concerned to give them
the possibility to submit observations (— except if it is necessary to preserve the
confidentiality of an investigation or of national judicial proceedings).
316EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
General > Article 35 — Force majeure
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot be considered
in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement,
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control,
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants involved in the
action), and
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without delay, stating
the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force majeure and do
their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.
1. Force majeure
What? In case of force majeure, the parties will be excused from not fulfilling their
obligations (i.e. there will be no breach of obligations under the Grant Agreement and none of
the adverse measures for breach of contract will be applied).
‘Force majeure’ relates to an extraordinary event or situation that is beyond the party’s
control and that prevents it from fulfilling its obligations under the Grant Agreement.
The event or situation must be inevitable (despite the beneficiary’s due diligence, i.e. level of
care that can reasonably be expected from a beneficiary, in order to ensure the fulfilment of
its obligations under the Grant Agreement) and unforeseeable. Force majeure can NOT be
used to justify situations caused by a beneficiary’s negligence, events that could reasonably
have been anticipated or events that are inherent to the normal activity of the beneficiary
(e.g. sick leaves, strikes, technical failure, human errors, etc.).
Examples (force majeure): An earthquake, terrorist attack or volcanic eruption; delay in using
equipment due to floods in the region/country.
Examples (not force majeure): machine malfunctions, robberies; a subcontractor building a test
site goes bankrupt, labour disputes or strikes, financial difficulties, personnel issues, for example
sickness
Usually, force majeure can be evoked ONLY for the immediate impact of the situation. Once
earthquakes, extreme weather events, etc. have taken place and impact on the further
implementation of the action becomes foreseeable, the beneficiaries must adapt their planning,
take mitigation measures and take all other necessary steps to fulfil their obligations under the
Grant Agreement under the new circumstances.
317EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If force majeure entails extra costs for the implementation of the action they may be eligible
but it will normally be the beneficiaries that will have to bear them (since they were not
budgeted in the proposal and the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 cannot be increased).
If a task for the action could not be executed due to a situation of force majeure but certain
costs were incurred for that task and could not have been avoided, those costs may still be
eligible and can be charged to the action.
Example: Airline tickets bought by a beneficiary to attend a meeting related to the action. The
flight is cancelled because the air traffic is suspended due a terrorist threat, and so the beneficiary
cannot travel to the meeting. If the ticket costs fulfil the eligibility conditions set out under Article 6
of the Grant Agreement and it is impossible for the beneficiary to get those costs reimbursed (e.g
by the airline or a travel insurance) then they may be eligible, even if the beneficiary did not travel.
Force majeure may lead to Grant Agreement suspension (see Article 31) or Grant Agreement
termination (see Article 32).
How? The coordinator must immediately formally notify the granting authority (through
Portal Formal Notifications: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification).
The beneficiary concerned must quickly put in place all possible measures to limit the
damage caused by the force majeure, including measures to limit related costs.

CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
General > Article 36 — Communication between the parties
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
[OPTION 1 for eGrants:
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal in accordance with the Portal Terms and
Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if explicitly instructed otherwise by the
granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the Grant Agreement (project number and
acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and Conditions. For
naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated — before the signature of this
Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’. The role and tasks of the LEAR are
stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of sending, as
indicated by the time logs.
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the communication
is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not been accessed within 10 days
after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general principles apply
(i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with proof of delivery will be considered
to have been received either on the delivery date registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection
at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be considered in
breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Adresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is the official
mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.]
[OPTION 2 for paper grants: For grants which are not managed through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(see Data Sheet, Point 1), the specific rules set out in Annex 5 apply.]
1. Communication between the parties — Funding & Tenders Portal electronic
exchange system
319EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
All communications (information, requests, submissions, ‘formal notifications’, etc) between
the consortium and the granting authority — before and after the payment of the balance —
must be in electronic form and done directly inside the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The Funding & Tenders Portal is the European Commission platform for the single electronic
data exchange area for participants (SEDIA) under Article 150(1) of the EU Financial
Regulation 2024/250951.
The Portal offers different functions:
− viewing and changing the legal entity data in the Participant Register
− formal notifications and other actions inside the different grant management
workflows (amendments, reporting, deliverables, etc)
− contacting granting authority outside a workflow (either through the Portal Formal
Notifications Service or Messaging Service)
− where necessary, secured electronic signatures (for instance, for signing the Grant
Agreement, accession to the Grant Agreement, amendments and financial
statements).
It keeps logs of all communication and allows for delivery with proof of receipt.
All communications are recorded in the project file (with date and time). For communications
that trigger deadlines, also the date and time of access are recorded.
The use of Portal secured personalised area (‘My Area’, also called ‘electronic exchange
system’ or ‘Portal Grant Management System’) is subject to the Funding & Tenders Portal
Terms & Conditions.
Access is limited to persons with a user account and authorisation to act for the beneficiary.
For that purpose, all beneficiaries must have appointed a legal entity appointed
representative (LEAR) before signature of the Grant Agreement. Authorisation and access are
linked to user roles (e.g. LEAR, PLSIGN or PFSIGN).
Examples:
1. Only Legal Signatories (PLSIGNs) may sign the Grant Agreement and amendments.
2. Only Financial Statement Signatories (PFSIGNs) may sign the financial statements.
3. Only Primary Coordinator Contacts (PCoCos) and Coordinator Contacts (CoCo) may submit
information to the granting authority. The Primary Coordinator Contact can be changed only by the
responsible (project) officer in the back-office, while the other roles can be managed by the
participants themselves via the Portal. (In case of MSCA-IF the Supervisor identified in the proposal
becomes the PCoCo, in ERC grants the PI identified in the proposal becomes the PCoCo.)
4. Only Participant Contacts (PaCos) may submit information to the coordinator. They cannot
submit information directly to the granting authority.
5. Only the Participant Contact(s) (PaCo, or PCoCo and CoCo(s) in case of the coordinator), Legal
Signatory (PLSIGN) or Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) of the recipient beneficiary may access a
formal notification for the first time (i.e. may formally receive it).
6. Task Managers (TaMa) may only complete and save web forms and upload documents related to
their organisation’s participation in the grant. They cannot submit information to the coordinator or
the granting authority.
7. Team Members (TeMe) have read-only access to project information. They cannot complete or
save forms, nor submit information to the coordinator or the granting authority.

More details on My Area and access and roles in the Portal are explained in the Online
Manual > My Area.
In principle, all communications from/to the granting authority must normally go via the
coordinator — unless the Grant Agreement or other rules provide for direct communication
with the other beneficiaries (e.g. Articles 21, 25, 26, 39; OLAF Regulations No 883/2013 and
No 2185/2996).
By using the Portal, the communications will automatically fulfil the minimum conditions
set out in the Grant Agreement (i.e. that they must be made in writing and bear the number
of the Grant Agreement (project number and acronym), in order to be on record and
identifiable).
For actions that require a document upload, you should always use the forms and
templates provided on the Portal Reference Documents — unless explicitly instructed
otherwise by the granting authority.
Beneficiaries may receive notifications even after the end of the project (e.g. for audits,
impact evaluations, etc). Therefore they (and in particular their LEARs) are obliged to keep
the contact data up to date, in order to ensure that the communication channels remain
active.
The responsibility for opening notifications in time is with the beneficiaries.
Formal notifications are considered to have been accessed 10 days after they have
been sent (— even if not actually opened by the recipient, e.g. refusal of reception or
omission). Deadlines that are counted from the date of receipt are counted as of day eleven
(see Article 3.3.3 Funding & Tenders Portal Terms & Conditions).
The same is in principle valid for formal notifications after the payment of the balance —
except that the granting authority will check that the notification has actually been
accessed by the beneficiary (at any time, before or after the 10 days deadline). If it was
not accessed, the granting authority will send a second notification, this time on paper by
registered post with proof of delivery. In that case, the deadlines will start to run from the
date of receipt of the second notification.
Specific cases (Portal access rights):
Beneficiaries in bankruptcy — If a beneficiary goes bankrupt during the action, the
liquidator may be granted the necessary access rights in the Portal, in order to complete the
beneficiary’s obligations. If exceptionally necessary, the granting authority can also agree to
communication outside the Portal electronic exchange system (i.e. via registered post or e-
mails).
2. Date of communication
Communications are considered to have been sent on the date and time they are sent
through the electronic exchange system.
Communications are considered to have been received on the date and time they were
accessed. If formal notifications have not been accessed within 10 days after sending, they
will be considered to have been accessed.
Formal communications made on paper, sent by registered post with proof of delivery, are
considered to have been made on either:
− the delivery date registered by the postal service or
− the deadline for collection at the post office.
321EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The sending party cannot be considered in breach of its obligation to comply with a deadline
in case it can demonstrate that the electronic exchange system was unavailable.
3. Addresses
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
If exceptionally, the communication is on paper, the addresses are as follows:
− for communicating to the granting authority: the official mailing address indicated on
its website (or as otherwise indicated in the call)
− for communicating to beneficiaries: the legal address specified in the Portal Participant
Register.

General > Article 38 — Calculation of periods and deadlines
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7147, periods expressed in days, months or years are calculated from
the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
47 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time-limits
(OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
1. Periods in days
A period expressed in days starts on the day following the triggering event and ends at
midnight of the last day of the period.
Days are calendar days (not working days).
Example:
Under Article 21.2 and in accordance with the schedule set out in Point 4.2 of the Data Sheet, the
coordinator (or beneficiaries in mono-beneficiaries grants) must submit a periodic report within 60
days following the end of each reporting period.
The action is divided into the following reporting periods:
RP1: from 1 March 2022 to 31 August 2023
RP2: from 1 September 2023 to 28 February 2024
Therefore, the deadline of 60 days for the first periodic report starts on 1 September 2023 and ends
on 30 October 2023.
The deadline of 60 days for the second and last periodic report starts on 1 March 2024 and ends on
29 of April 2024.
2. Periods in months or years
Periods expressed in months or years end at midnight on the day with the same date as the
day on which the period started, in the last month or year of the period.
Example: Under Article 29, the granting authority may suspend the payment deadline if a request
for payment cannot be processed. The suspension takes effect on the day the granting authority
sends the notification. When the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the
granting authority to confirm if the suspension will continue. The granting authority sent the
notification for a grant payment deadline on 31 July 2023. Therefore, the suspension will have
exceeded two months on 30 September 2023.
If that day does not exist (e.g. 31 of April), the period ends at midnight of the last day of that
month (e.g. 30 of April).
Example: Under Article 25.1.2 and in accordance with the time-limit set out in Point 6 of the Data
Sheet, reviews may be started up to two years after the final payment is made. A grant’s final
payment takes place on 29 February 2023. Therefore, the two-year review period starts on 1 March
2023 and ends on 1 March 2025.

General > Article 39 — Amendments
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would call
into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in the Portal
Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries (see Annex 3). If
a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission must be done by another
beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or proof that this
opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45 days of receiving
notification (or any additional information the granting authority has requested). If it does not agree, it must
formally notify its disagreement within the same deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for
the assessment of the request. If no notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to
have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the amendment.
1. Amendments
What & When? Amendments serve to change the Grant Agreement by mutual consent of
the parties.
They are normally done at the initiative of the consortium, but they may also be initiated by
the granting authority (e.g. where errors need to be corrected; to change Annex 1 after a
review of the action, etc).
They are mandatory for all substantive or important changes to the Grant Agreement, e.g.
changes impacting the project outcome, changes that affect the description of the action in
Annex 1, etc.
325EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The general terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement that apply to all EU grants
can NOT be changed via an amendment. Only project-specific data (e.g. duration of the
reporting periods, starting date, etc.) and the options in the Grant Agreement are open to
amendments.
Moreover, amendments may NOT result in changes that — if they had been known before
awarding the grant — would have had an impact on the award decision. Those are mostly
changes that:
− involve the consortium composition and have an impact on the eligibility criteria set
out in the call conditions (e.g. minimum number or types of participants in a proposal)
− involve changes to the action and/or its budget and affect the award criteria
announced in the call conditions (e.g. the tasks in Annex 1 are changed so
substantially that the action no longer corresponds to the scope of the call for
proposals)
− breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
− do not comply with the applicable rules (e.g. Financial Regulation 2024/2509) or with
provisions of the Grant Agreement itself (e.g. amendment to subcontract tasks of the
coordinator).
Characteristics of amendments:
▪ Can only be done in writing — a verbal agreement is not binding on the parties
since EU granting authorities are bound to written format52.
▪ Enters into force after the signature by the coordinator and the granting authority
through an exchange of signatures.
▪ Takes effect on the date agreed by the parties (retroactive or in the future); if no
date is specified, on the date when the second party approves it (not retroactive).
▪ Are usually available only during the action (i.e. after the entry into force of the
Grant Agreement and before the final payment).
▪ Must normally be requested before the end of the project; in exceptional cases
amendment clauses are also open after the end of the project (e.g. change of
coordinator or change of coordinator’s bank account, in order to be able to make
the final payment).
▪ Has to be signed by persons having the same capacity to represent the legal entity
as those who signed the initial Grant Agreement.
▪ Leaves all the other provisions of the Grant Agreement which are not affected
unchanged and with continued full effect.
▪ Forms an integral part of the Grant Agreement.
▪ Has to be in line with the rules applicable to the Grant Agreement (including
applicable EU, international and national law, where relevant under the
Agreement).
52 See Article 204(1) Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 201(1) Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
326EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Cannot have the purpose or effect of making changes to the Grant Agreement
which might call into question the decision awarding the grant or result in unequal
treatment of beneficiaries or applicants.
From a strictly legal perspective, amendments are necessary whenever there is a need to
change the Grant Agreement (including changes to its Annexes).
The amendment clauses that are available in the Portal Amendment tool are called ‘AT
clauses’.
Example: If an affiliated entity ends its participation, the option in Article 8 and the Data Sheet
must be updated to set its ‘termination date’. This can be done by using amendment clause AT6.
If such changes affect the implementation of the action and require an amendment, the
granting authority will examine the situation and inform the coordinator.
Examples (change that requires an amendment):
1. Beneficiary A becomes bankrupt. It will be necessary terminate its participation and to amend
the Grant Agreement.
2. Beneficiary B moves from Europe to Australia during the action. The change of address implies
that the beneficiary becomes ineligible for funding, so the Grant Agreement will have to be
amended to terminate participation or change role to associated partner.
Example (change that does NOT require an amendment): Beneficiary D changes its name.
The update in the Portal Participant Register is sufficient; no amendment is needed.
Information obligation — Changes in the name, address, legal form and organisation type
AND changes in the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation may or may
not require an amendment (see below) — but they ALL trigger the information obligation under
Article 19.3.
Changes without any impact on the Grant Agreement normally do NOT necessarily require a
formal amendment. They are therefore sometimes done by information procedure,
sometimes by formal amendment (if simpler because an automated clause is available).
Sample list (non-exhaustive) of cases where an amendment is necessary:
▪ Addition of a new beneficiary (AT1; see Article 40.2)
What? Addition of a new beneficiary during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The new beneficiary must first register (and get validated) in the Portal Participant
Register — unless it already has a validated participant identification code (PIC).
The beneficiary’s name (and their entry date) will be updated in the Preamble and the
list of participants in the Data Sheet and the beneficiary will be entitled to submit costs
as from that date.
For the entry date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the date of signature of the Accession Form OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment.
Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the
entry date (of the new beneficiary) may be set before the termination date (of the
beneficiary that is replaced) — so that both can incur costs for a certain period.
Example: The former beneficiary ends its participation on 01.06.2021, and the new beneficiary
accedes to the Grant Agreement on 01.05.2021.
Combinations
327EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
If the new beneficiary is participating with affiliated entities/associated partners, they
will also have to be added (with effect from the same date) (AT2, AT3).
For international organisations a change of the applicable law/dispute settlement
options may be needed (AT16, AT17).
▪ Addition of an affiliated entity/associated partner (AT2, AT3; see Article 8 and
9.1)
What? Addition of a new affiliated entity/associated partner during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The new affiliated entity/associated partner must first register (and, for affiliated
entities, also get validated) in the Portal Participant Register — unless it already has a
participant identification code (PIC).
The affiliated entity/associated partner name (and their entry date) will be updated in
the list of participants in the Data Sheet and Article 8/9.1.
For the entry date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date OR the accession date
of the beneficiary OR the date of entry into force of the amendment.
If the affiliated entity/associated partner joins the action at the same time as the
beneficiary they are linked to, the starting date of participation must be the same as the
date of the new beneficiary.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
▪ Beneficiary termination (AT4; see Article 32.2)
What? Removal of a beneficiary during the action.
There is NO need to request an amendment if termination takes effect after the end of
the action (see Article 4) — unless the beneficiary concerned is the coordinator AND the
amendment is necessary for submitting the reports and distributing the payments.
There is NO more need for a separate termination notification (simplification; new for
2021-2027).
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The beneficiary’s name (and their exit and termination dates) will be updated in the
Preamble and the list of participants in the Data Sheet. The beneficiary will be entitled
to submit costs until that date.
For the exit date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the day after submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force
of the amendment.
The exit date should be the date the participant stops (or stopped) working on the
action (i.e. end of cost eligibility date).
328EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For the termination date, the choice is between a fixed date (future) after the
submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment, whichever is the latest. It is normally predefined by the exit date and
automatically fixed by the IT system.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
If the beneficiary was participating with affiliated entities/associated partners, they will
also have to be removed (with effect from the same date) (AT6, AT7).
If the coordinator is removed, the amendment will also have to propose a new
coordinator and coordinator bank account (AT11, AT12).
▪ Removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner (AT6, AT7; see Article 8 and
9.1)
What? Removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
If requested by the granting authority (e.g. because of audit results or an OLAF
investigation), the consortium MUST submit an amendment to remove an affiliated
entity/associated partner. If the consortium does not follow-up this request, the
beneficiary can be terminated by the granting authority (which will also remove the
affiliated entity/associated partner).
The name of the affiliated entity/associated partner (and their exit and termination
dates) will be updated in the list of participants in the Data Sheet and Article 8/9.1.
For the exit date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the day after submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force
of the amendment.
For the termination date, the choice is between a fixed date (future) after the
submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment, whichever is the latest. It is normally predefined by the exit date and
automatically fixed by the IT system.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
▪ Change of coordinator (AT11)
What? Replacement of the coordinator during the action (e.g. because of financial
difficulties).
This amendment clause usually remains open even after the end of the action — until
the final payment is paid out.
What not? There is NO need to request an amendment if there is only a change in the
person in charge of the coordination of the project (since the person’s name is not
mentioned in the Grant Agreement).
Information obligation — In this case you should however inform the granting
authority (see Article 19).
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
329EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The new coordinator becomes beneficiary No 1 in the Preamble and list of participants
in the Data Sheet and the handover date is added to the coordinator list in the Data
Sheet.
For the handover date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or
future) OR the date of entry into force of the amendment.
The handover date should be the date when the new coordinator takes over (and the
former coordinator stops acting as coordinator).
If there was a gap (former coordinator leaves before new coordinator starts; e.g.
coordinator is in bankruptcy) this will be visible in the coordinator list, since the handover
date for the former coordinator (when it stopped doing coordinator tasks) must be at the
latest its termination date.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
The coordinator bank account will have to be changed (AT12).
If the new coordinator is not already a beneficiary of the Grant Agreement, it must
first accede to the Grant Agreement as a new beneficiary (AT1).
If the former coordinator would like to leave, its participation will have to be
terminated (AT4).
▪ Change of the coordinator’s bank account for payments (AT12)
What? An amendment is necessary for all events that imply a change of the account
number/IBAN code indicated in the Grant Agreement (see Data Sheet, Point 4).
What not? NO amendment is necessary for a change of the name of the bank or name
of the account holder; a change of the bank account data (and validation) in the Portal
Participant Register is sufficient.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The bank account data must first be updated in the Portal Participant Register (and be
validated).
▪ Changes to Annex 1 (description of the action) (AT21)
What? Changes to the description of the action, in particular:
− significant change of the action tasks (e.g. if tasks are added/removed) or of
their division among the beneficiaries
Significant changes to the action such as removal of action tasks may put into
question the decision to award the grant. The granting authority will assess on a
case-by-case basis whether such changes are permissible.
− changes concerning eligible in-kind contributions provided by third parties free
of charge (HE) or subcontracts
Such changes could in principle also be made via simplified approval procedure
(see Articles 9.2 and 9.3); however, if the beneficiary requests an amendment,
it will immediately know if the granting authority agrees (or not). Without
amendment, this decision is left for later and the granting authority may reject
the costs as ineligible at the moment of the payment.
330EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− changes concerning the tasks to be carried out by affiliated entities and related
costs (including if an affiliated entity is removed)
− changes concerning Grant Agreement options (options are removed or added)
− significant changes concerning deliverables (e.g. adding/removing deliverables;
changes in substance of a project output which is reflected in a deliverable,
etc.).
What not? Changes to the due date of a deliverable normally do not require an
amendment.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Combinations
Annex 2 may have to be changed (AT41).
▪ Change of the starting date, project duration or reporting periods (AT24,
AT25, AT26)
What? Change of the action’s schedule (starting date, action duration or reporting
periods).
Example: The Grant Agreement for the action has a fixed starting date that is before the
date on which the Grant Agreement enters into force. Because of weather conditions, the
consortium cannot start on that date and requests the granting authority to change it.
Even if the action is prolonged, the maximum grant amount will NOT be increased.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Extensions should be requested before the action ends and must be specifically
justified.
Combinations
Annex 1 may have to be changed (AT21).
Depending on the case all three clauses may have to be used (AT24, AT25 and AT26).
▪ Changes to Annex 2 (estimated budget) and Annex 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, if
necessary (AT41, AT51, AT51a, 51b, 51c, 51d)
What? Changes to the estimated budget, in particular:
− a budget transfer between beneficiaries or between budget categories (or both)
which is linked to a significant change in the action’s work (i.e. Annex 1);
including new subcontracts (for HE, also new eligible in-kind contributions)
− a budget transfer to a form of costs that was not used by the beneficiary (i.e.
with 0 EUR costs in Annex 2) — except for transfer of amounts to budget
categories which are based on unit costs or unit contributions calculated using
the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary (e.g. budget category D.2
Internal invoices)
− a budget transfer to or from the budget category for volunteers (for
programmes with eligible costs for volunteers: ERDF-TA, LIFE, ERASMUS,
CREA, CERV, JUST, ESF/SOCPL, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
− a budget transfer to or from to budget categories based on lump sum costs or
lump sum contributions
331EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What not? There is NO need to request an amendment for changes covered by the
budget flexibility rule in Article 5.5.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Best practice: If Annex 2b or other specific cost annexes need to be changed, the
beneficiaries should contact the granting authority.
Combinations
Annex 1 may have to be changed (AT21).
2. Procedure
How? Amendment requests must be prepared by the requesting party (i.e. usually the
coordinator) directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
Best practice: In case of doubt or if none of the available amendment clauses fit,
beneficiaries should contact the granting authority, to discuss the amendment.
For the addition of new partners, the new entities (beneficiaries, affiliated entities or
associated partners) must have been registered (and beneficiaries and affiliated entities also
validated) in the Participant Register.
Examples:
1. A new beneficiary must be validated (legal entity validation). This means that the new beneficiary will have
to register in the Portal Participant Register, be validated and appoint a LEAR.
2. Validation of the new bank account, to change the bank account.
The request must be unambiguous and complete and submitted in time (i.e. sufficiently in
advance to allow proper analysis and preparation before it is due to take effect and —
generally — before the end of the action; see Article 4). Requests introduced AFTER the end
of the action will be accepted only exceptionally, for very specific and duly substantiated
cases (e.g. change of bank account, change of coordinator to make the final payment).
The coordinator must ensure that they have the agreement of the consortium (in accordance
with the internal decision-making processes, e.g. unanimity, simple or qualified majority, etc
set out in the consortium agreement; where applicable).
Once completed, the request (with all its uploaded supporting documents) must be
submitted and signed by the PLSIGN of the coordinator (on behalf of the other
beneficiaries, on the basis of the mandate given in the accession forms).
Pending amendment requests may at any moment be withdrawn (before they have been
accepted or formally rejected).
Example: The coordinator requests an amendment to change its bank account number and the
reallocation of tasks in Annex 1 and of budget in Annex 2. Since the change of bank account is
urgent because the Commission has to make the interim payment and the revision of the Annexes
may require more time, the coordinator withdraws the request and makes a new request to change
only the bank account and a second one to change the Annexes.
A request containing several changes to the Grant Agreement will be considered as one (and
must either be agreed or rejected by the other party as a whole).
If the receiving party requests additional information/documents, a new deadline will apply,
i.e. 45 days from receiving the additional information/documents.
Example: The coordinator submits a request to add a new beneficiary with several affiliated
entities (see Article 8). The granting authority requests a signed declaration for the joint and
several liability of the affiliated entities (Annex 3a). A new 45-day deadline for evaluation and
validation will apply from the moment the granting authority receives the declaration.
The other party must — within 45 days — agree or disagree.
332EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The deadline may exceptionally be extended by the receiving party, for a period to be
determined case-by-case and if necessary for the assessment of the request (e.g. a review is
needed to assess the changes).
If accepted it will be counter-signed by the receiving party directly in the Portal Amendment
tool (for the consortium: by the PLSIGN of the coordinator).
If there is no reaction within the deadline, the request is in principle considered to have been
rejected (there is NO tacit approval of amendments). A new amendment request may
however be submitted — even if it fully or partly repeats the initial request.
3. Effects
The amendment enters into force and is binding from the moment the receiving party has
agreed to it (i.e. signed in the Portal Amendment tool).
The amendment will take effect (i.e. the changes to the Grant Agreement will start to apply)
either:
− on the day of its entry into force (i.e. day of the last signature of the amendment) or
− on the specific date(s) indicated (and agreed) in the amendment.
The date should normally be after the entry into force of the amendment. In justified cases it
may — exceptionally — be before (retroactivity of the amendment). In some cases, the Grant
Agreement itself provides for retroactivity.
Examples (retroactivity allowed/foreseen in the GA):
1. Where a new beneficiary is added to the Grant Agreement (AT3), it must assume the rights and
obligations from the accession date specified in the Accession Form. If this date is before the entry
into force of the amendment, this retroactivity implies that its costs will be considered eligible as
from the accession date (and not as from the entry into force of the amendment).
2. Following a suspension of the implementation of the action by the beneficiary or by the
Commission, the suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the
amendment (AT26). This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force
(see Article 31.2.2).
3. If the amendment intends to correct an error (AT60), the change will be made with effect from
entry into force of the Grant Agreement (i.e. from the beginning).
Depending on the amendment clause, the date of taking effect may have an impact on the
eligibility of costs.
Amendment request involving several changes, may take effect on different dates.
Example: On 1 May 2022, the coordinator requests an amendment to change the bank account
and to add a new beneficiary. The addition of the beneficiary takes effect from the date of its
accession, as specified in the Accession Form (1 April 2022), while the change of bank account
takes effect on a date agreed by the parties or on the date on which the amendment enters into
force (e.g. 10 June 2022, the day it is signed by the receiving party).
Specific cases (amendments):
Budget transfers — Only the budget transfers that imply a change of Annex 2 (or one of its
Annexes 2a-2e) require an amendment. Other transfers are covered by the budget flexibility
principle and normally do NOT need an amendment (see Article 5.5).
Examples (no need for amendment):
1. During the action implementation, a beneficiary that declared its direct personnel costs as actual
costs decides to change this and instead to declare them as unit costs in accordance with its usual
accounting practices (average personnel costs), which is allowed in its Grant Agreement.
2. An SME joins an on-going GA. The SME owner does not have a salary but incorrectly budgets its
costs as actual personnel costs (category A.1). She realises the mistake and then switches to the
unit costs for SME owners (category A.4); which is allowed in her Grant Agreement.
333EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Change of name, address or other legal entity data (of beneficiaries/affiliated
entities) — Changes to participant legal data normally do NOT require an amendment.
Simple changes of name, legal form (e.g. Ltd., S.A.), official registration number, address,
VAT number do NOT require an amendment. An update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR
(and validation) in the Portal Participant Register is normally sufficient.
If (exceptionally) the granting authority considers that the registered change affects the
implementation of the action, it will inform the coordinator (and instruct them to request an
amendment, if needed).
Example: Company R moves from Europe to Australia and this implies that the beneficiary is no
longer eligible for EU funding. In such a case, the coordinator will be asked to make an amendment
to the Grant Agreement to exchange the beneficiary or to change its role into ‘associated partner’.
Short names have no legal value and only serve as easy identifiers in the Grant Agreement.
If needed, they can be changed through an amendment (AT15).
A change of the person that represents the coordinator for the purposes of signing the Grant
Agreement requires NO follow-up at all (not even a change in the Portal Participant Register
— since the contact information there is only relevant at the moment of Grant Agreement
signature (not afterwards).
Beneficiary termination due to non-accession — The amendment will have ex tunc effect
(as from the beginning of the action and Preamble, list of participants in the Data Sheet and
Article 8 and 9.1 will be adapted to reflect that the beneficiary (and its affiliated
entities/associated partners) had never joined.
Change of roles — Participant changes that involve the switching of roles are now all done
through so-called ‘in/out amendments’ (new for 2021-2027). Meaning that the entity ends its
participation with one role and starts a new participation with another role.
Be aware that there may be timing restrictions which you may have to respect in that
case (e.g. exit date in one role must be before starting date in another role).
In case of loss of eligibility (and if participation is still allowed), partners may be forced to
switch roles (e.g. from beneficiary/affiliated entity to associated partner).
Example: Beneficiary R moves from Europe to Australia and becomes no longer eligible for
receiving EU funding under the programme. Since participants must comply with the eligibility
conditions throughout the duration of the action, the Grant Agreement must be amended to change
the beneficiary or change its role to associated partner. If R is participating with an affiliated entity
M established in France, M will continue being eligible for funding, but would have to change role to
participate as beneficiary.
Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility (see Article
6). That date should therefore be used as exit date.
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — After the end of
the action, if the coordinator can continue its participation with the bank account of the
administrator/liquidator (i.e. termination and coordinator change not really needed), it will be
exceptionally sufficient to just change the bank account for payments (AT12) without
changing the coordinator.
If the coordinator ceased business operations and will not be able to continue participating in
the project, a coordinator change amendment will be needed. If the coordinator is no longer
able to submit the request for amendment (e.g. because the LEAR and all personnel with
access rights in the Portal IT tools left), the same procedure as for coordinator change
without its agreement should be used (see below).
Termination of the coordinator without their agreement — If the consortium
terminates the coordinator without its agreement, it must provide proof of its decision to
334EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
change the coordinator and nominate one of the beneficiaries to act on its behalf to request
the amendment (see Article 32 and below). Contact the EU project officer in charge of your
grant.
Partial takeovers (PTROs) — Partial takeovers (like all other transfers) are now also
handled as normal in/out amendments (there are no more special all-in-one amendment
clauses for transfers). The former participants will therefore have to submit a termination
report and their participation will be formally closed.
In view of the special status of partial takeovers, the accession forms for new beneficiaries
include a clause on joint and several liability for undue amounts paid to the beneficiary they
replace (i.e. recoveries).
Partial takeovers are transfers of a business unit as a going concern (i.e. transfers that go
beyond the simple sale of assets where a part of the business of the beneficiary — including
the Grant Agreement — is taken over by (one or more) other entity(ies), e.g. partial
acquisition, distribution of a business unit after dissolution/liquidation, division/demerger,
etc).
Partial transfers are generally very complex and their effects depend on the specific
circumstances of each case and grant contract and often also on national law.
Depending on whether the initial entity disappears or continues, there are different types of
partial takeovers:
− Partial acquisition — the original entity continues to exist, but a new entity purchases
a department, business unit, or similar (and absorbs or takes over part of the rights
and obligations of the original entity).
Thus, some of the rights and obligations (and contracts) of the original entity are
transferred to the new entity. Since the beneficiary continues to exist as a legal entity
and only some of its rights and obligations are affected, a case-by-case analysis is
needed (and an amendment therefore necessary).
Example: Company X sells its mobile phone division to company Z; all grants where the mobile
phone division of X was involved will be affected by the transfer of rights and obligations; other
grants where other divisions of company X work will not be affected.
− Distribution of a business unit on dissolution/liquidation — the original entity
disappears (due to dissolution or liquidation), but (one or more) new entities purchase
a department, business unit or similar (and absorb or take over part of its rights and
obligations).
Since only some of the beneficiary’s rights and obligations are transferred, a case-by-
case analysis is needed (and an amendment therefore necessary).
− Division/demerger — the original entity disappears and several entities replace it;
different parts of the original entity are transferred to the new entities (i.e. several
partial transfers to different entities).
Examples:
1. Company X has several ongoing grants. Company X is bought by two other companies (Y &
Z), one of which will absorb the mobile phone division and the other the remaining divisions.
For some grants there will be a transfer of rights and obligations from X to Y, for other grants it
will be from X to Z.
2. Company Ω has an ongoing grant (covering some action tasks to be implemented by its
engineering division and some action tasks to be implemented by other divisions). Company Ω
is bought by two other companies (E and O), one of which absorbs the engineering division and
the other the remaining divisions. There are two partial takeovers: one to company E and one
to company O.
335EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the in/out amendment is due to a partial transfer, this should be clearly mentioned in the
amendment request (together with a copy of the takeover contract, a short summary of the
facts, timeline and effects of the takeover under the applicable national law and a list of the
relevant provisions with references and hyperlinks to the texts.
Universal takeovers — Transfers of the Grant Agreement linked to a universal takeover
normally do NOT require an amendment; an update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR (and
validation) in the Portal Participant Register is sufficient.
Universal takeovers are transfers where the original entity is replaced by one new entity and
all the rights and obligations — including the Grant Agreement — are transferred to this new
entity (e.g. merger or full acquisition).
Example: Beneficiary X merges with another existing entity Y by:
− becoming part of it (thus X and Y are together known as ‘Y’, and entity X ceases to exist) or
− establishing a new separate legal entity (X and Y are together known as ‘Z’).
If (exceptionally) the granting authority considers that the registered transfer affects the
action implementation, it will inform the coordinator (and instruct it to request an
amendment, if needed).
Example:
1. The legal form or type of organisation of the new entity differs from that of the former
beneficiary or affiliated entity and this has an impact on the implementation of the action.
2. The coordinator transfers all its rights and obligations to another legal entity. If this involves a
change of the bank account number in Data Sheet, each Grant Agreement in which it participates
as coordinator must be amended to update this information (AT12).
Information obligation — In case of a universal takeover, the beneficiary must — in
addition to updating the data in the Portal Participant Register— inform the coordinator via its
usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc) under
Article 19.
If a potential planned universal takeover could significantly affect or delay the implementation
of the action, the EU financial interests, the decision to award the grant or the compliance with
the Grant Agreement, the coordinator should flag this as soon as possible the granting
authority. The same applies if the universal takeover concerns an affiliated entity.

General > Article 40 — Accession and addition of new beneficiaries
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession form (see
Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry into force of the
Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of its entry into
force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must — within 30
days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and make any changes necessary
to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate
the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 39. It must
include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal Amendment
tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
1. Accession of beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
All beneficiaries (except the coordinator) must accede to the Grant Agreement by signing the
accession form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal. They must do this within 30 days after
the Grant Agreement enters into force (see Article 44). With the signature of this form, they
will assume the rights and be bound by the obligations under the Agreement with effect from
the date of its entry into force (retroactive).
Before being able to sign the accession form, each beneficiary will have to have provided
their declaration of honour (DoH) and those for its affiliated entities.
In addition, where required by the granting authority during grant preparation, the
beneficiaries concerned will have to have provided their declarations on joint and several
liability (see Annex 3a).
Affiliated entities or associated partners do not become parties to the Grant Agreement and
therefore do NOT need to sign an accession form.
The coordinator is NOT obliged to distribute hard copies of the Grant Agreement and
Accession Form to the other beneficiaries. All documents are available in the project file on
the Portal.
2. Addition of new beneficiaries (amendment)
What? In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request adding a new beneficiary.
337EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The new beneficiary must comply with the eligibility criteria of the call conditions, have
sufficient operational and financial capacity to perform the proposed tasks, comply with the
non-exclusion criteria and commit to implement the action under the same terms and
conditions as the other beneficiaries.
Mono-beneficiary grants can become multi-beneficiary grants, by addition of a new
beneficiary (new for 2021-2027).
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39).
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary.
Before, the new beneficiary must have taken all necessary steps to be able to participate as
beneficiary, i.e. register in the Participant Register and be validated — unless it already has a
validated participant identification code (PIC), provide his declaration on honour, provide a
declaration on joint and several liability of its affiliated entity (if required by the granting
authority), etc.
Effects:
The accession form must specify the accession date. It must be either:
− the date of signature of the accession form
− the date of entry into force of the amendment
OR
− a fixed date:
− either retroactive (i.e. before signature of the accession form)
OR
− future (i.e. after signature of the accession form — this should be an
exceptional case with a justification).
Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the
accession date may be set before the termination date (of the beneficiary that is replaced) —
so that both can incur costs for a certain period.

General > Article 41 — GA transfer
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the grant to a new
beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal Amendment
tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
1. GA transfers
What? In justified cases, mono-beneficiary grants may be transferred to a new beneficiary,
provided that certain conditions are complied with. Article 41 does not apply to multi-
beneficiary actions.
NO transfer can be conducted before the amendment has been accepted by the granting
authority. Transfers without a formal amendment are void and may result in grant
termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible until the granting authority has
approved the amendment.
‘Transfer’ means that the rights and obligations under the Grant Agreement are transferred
from the current beneficiary to a new beneficiary — without passing via termination (Article
32) or addition of a new beneficiary (Article 40.2).
The transfer may NOT call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants. The new beneficiary must comply with the
eligibility criteria of the call conditions, have sufficient operational and financial capacity to
perform the proposed tasks and commit to implement the action under the same terms and
conditions as the former beneficiary.
Example: The transfer will not be accepted if the new beneficiary does not fulfil the eligibility
conditions or does not have sufficient financial and operational capacity.
How? The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the
granting authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why. If the contracting authority considers that the reasons provided do
not justify the transfer, it may reject the request
339EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the accession form in Annex 3 (i.e. the statement to take over all rights and
obligations under the Grant Agreement) of the new beneficiary (signed directly in the
Portal)
− any other supporting documents required by the granting authority.
Effects:
If the request for the transfer of the Grant Agreement to a new beneficiary is accepted by the
granting authority, the Agreement will be amended to introduce the necessary changes and
the new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations thereof.
The transfer will take effect on the day of accession specified in the accession form (see
Annex 3).

General > Article 42 — Assignments of claims for payment against the granting authority
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE
GRANTING AUTHORITY
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE GRANTING
AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting authority to any third
party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority on the basis of a reasoned, written
request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed, the assignment
will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations towards the granting
authority.
1. Assignment of claims for payment
What? The beneficiaries may assign (i.e. transfer, sell or give) claims for payment (for work
carried out under the action) to a third party, if the granting authority has explicitly approved
it in writing and on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator.
Assignment has NO effect on the beneficiary’s obligations under the Grant Agreement; it
remains fully bound by them.
‘Assignments of rights’ are limited to claims for payment under Article 22.1. Transfers of
other rights or obligations (e.g. replacement of a beneficiary by the entity that bought it) are
governed by other provisions (e.g. amendments; see Article 39).
Only actual (i.e. existing) claims for payment may be assigned (including pre-financing).
Assignment is NOT possible for future claims.
How? Assignment of payment claims must be requested to the granting authority.
The request for approval must come from the coordinator, on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned. It must be in writing and must explain the reasons for the assignment.
The granting authority will assess the reasons given and approve or reject the request in
writing. In case the granting authority does not approve the assignment or if the terms of it
are not observed, the assignment will have no effect.
Examples (reasonable requests for assignment):
1. Assignment of a claim for payment for work carried out by a research laboratory sold after the
end of the action (but before payment of the balance) by a beneficiary to another legal entity.
2. Assignment for the benefit of creditors in a bankruptcy procedure.
If the assignment is linked to bankruptcy, the approval will also be subject to compliance with
national law.

43.2 Dispute settlement
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties must bring action
before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice — under Article 272 of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of Brussels, Belgium —
unless an association agreement to the EU programme provides for the enforceability of EU court
judgements under Article 272 TFEU.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet, Point 5), the
dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in accordance with the Rules for
Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under Article 299 TFEU
(see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the General Court — or, on appeal, the
Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions against offsetting
and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European Commission (not against the granting
authority; see also Article 22).
1. Dispute settlement
As a general rule, the Grant Agreements contain an Article 272 TFEU arbitration clause —
referring contractual disputes (i.e. disputes on the interpretation, application or validity of the
Grant Agreement) to the EU Courts (General Court).
An Article 272 action is ONLY possible once the granting authority position is final (i.e.
against confirmation letters, debit notes, etc.; NOT against audit reports, audit letters, pre-
information letters, etc).
Bringing an action against the granting authority:
− for grants signed by the European Commission: actions must be brought against the
Commission
− for grants signed by an EU executive agency or other EU body: actions must be brought
against the Agency or EU body.
For disputes of public law nature (i.e. which concern administrative sanctions, offsetting or
enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU; see Articles 22 and 34) actions must be
brought before the EU courts (General Court) under Article 263 TFEU (NOT before any other
court and NOT under Article 272).
Public law measures must ALWAYS be brought to the European Court of Justice under Article
263 TFEU (including actions brought by non-EU beneficiaries).
All procedures are organised in a way that the beneficiaries will always be informed about
what they can do if they disagree (means of redress information in the letters).
Specific cases (dispute settlement):
344EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Non-EU beneficiaries — Contractual disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium. The only exception concerns non-EU beneficiaries which are for the
purpose of the action considered to be established in an associated country and where the
corresponding association agreement to the EU programme provides for the enforceability of
EU court judgments under Article 272 TFEU. In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must
bring the contractual dispute before the EU courts (General Court).
International organisations (IOs) — Are the only types of beneficiaries that can make use
of arbitration in EU grants, as a special means of disputes settlement (provided that the
option is activated in the Grant Agreement; see Data sheet).
Thus, for international organisations, contractual disputes are referred to the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (instead of the EU General Court) and EU granting authorities will
normally avoid adopting public law measures, such as enforceable decisions under Article 299
TFEU or decisions on administrative sanctions (see Article 34). Offsetting remains possible
also against international organisations (as contractual measure, see Article 22.4).

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY (— ARTICLE 13)
[OPTION for programmes with security requirements: Sensitive information with security
recommendation
Sensitive information with a security recommendation must comply with the additional requirements
imposed by the granting authority.
Before starting the action tasks concerned, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals or other
mandatory documents needed for implementing the task. The documents must be kept on file and be
submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting authority. If they are not in English, they must be
submitted together with an English summary.
For requirements restricting disclosure or dissemination, the information must be handled in accordance with
the recommendation and may be disclosed or disseminated only after written approval from the granting
authority.]
[OPTION for programmes with EU classified information (standard): EU classified information
If EU classified information is used or generated by the action, it must be treated in accordance with the
security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter (SAL) set out in Annex 1 and Decision
2015/44449 and its implementing rules — until it is declassified.
Deliverables which contain EU classified information must be submitted according to special procedures
agreed with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving EU classified information may be subcontracted only with prior explicit written
approval from the granting authority and only to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU
country with a security of information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission).
EU classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants involved in the
action implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the granting authority.]

check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on confidentiality and security (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, EMFAF,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
Some programmes with calls that may involve sensitive or classified information (HE, DEP,
CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM) also have specific provisions on confidentiality and
security in Annex 5.
They cover sensitive information with security recommendations and EU classified
information.
347EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Sensitive information with a security recommendation (HE)
For these programmes, proposals may have to undergo a security review before selection
and may, if there are security issues, be made subject to specific security recommendations.
Examples (security issues): information on gaps and vulnerabilities in existing systems or
critical infrastructures, design, characteristics and requirements of devices used in detection, law-
enforcement measures to counter terrorism, tools and methodologies for predicting and detecting
organised criminal activities, etc.
Examples (security recommendations): classification, limited dissemination, establishment
of a security advisory board, appointment of a project security officer, limiting the level of detail,
using a fake scenario, etc.
Sensitive information concerning commercial secrets, know-how, etc are NOT sensitive
information within the meaning of Annex 5. Commercially sensitive information is already
protected under Article 13.1.
The most common security recommendations concern restricted disclosure or limited
dissemination. This leads to the creation of deliverables, which are sensitive information with
security recommendation. They are listed in Annex 1 (DoA, security section). If this is the
case, third parties should have no access them. Thus, before disclosure or dissemination to a
third party, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator, who must request written approval
from the granting authority. Other security recommendations concern the appointment of
security staff (security officers, security advisory board), specific measures for access to IT
systems, etc.
Some security requirements must be taken care of before grant signature, but most are for
implementation during the grant.
In addition, beneficiaries must obtain — before the start of the action task for which they are
needed — all the necessary security approvals, opinions, notifications and authorisations
(e.g. to security committees, etc). These documents do not need to be submitted, but must
be kept on file and provided on request (e.g. in case of security checks or audits). They must
be able to show that the opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the tasks to be
undertaken in the context of the action. If the documents are not in English, they may be
asked to provide an English summary.
Best practice: When preparing the applications for approvals/opinions/notifications/
authorisations, you should request the assistance of security experts, security
departments/committees and of your organisation’s data protection officer, if relevant.
In case of changes to the security situation, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator,
which must immediately inform the granting authority and, if necessary, request for Annex 1
to be amended.
The granting authority may carry out security checks or audits, to ensure that the
beneficiaries have properly implemented the security requirements and obtained the
opinions/notifications/authorisations (see Article 25).
3. EU classified information (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
Projects with EU classified information will moreover have to comply with the provisions
linked to EU classified information (see Article 13.2).
The project will have to follow a security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter
(SAL) which set out the classification-level and the measures that need to be taken to protect
the information. Both need to be added to Annex 1.
348EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Only entities listed in the security section of Annex 1 can have access to EU classified
information used or generated by the project. Before disclosure or dissemination to a third
party (including other participants involved in the action), the beneficiaries must inform the
coordinator, which must request written approval from the granting authority.
In case of changes to the security situation, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator,
which must immediately inform the granting authority and, if necessary, request for Annex 1
to be amended.
Deliverables containing EU classified information must be submitted following the special
procedure agreed with the granting authority, as described in the programme security
instruction (PSI) (e.g. HE PSI, DEP PSI, EDF PSI, ASAP PSI).
Action tasks involving EU classified information may ONLY be subcontracted (cumulative
conditions):
− to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission) and
− if the granting authority has explicitly approved such requests in writing.
For more guidance on classification of information and security obligations, see How to handle
security-sensitive projects, Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe
projects and Guidelines on the classification of information in Digital Europe projects.

AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14) (DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
[OPTION for programmes with specific ethics rules: Ethics
Actions involving activities raising ethics issues must be carried out in compliance with:
- ethical principles [(including the highest standards of research integrity)]
and
- applicable EU, international and national law, including [the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights
and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and
its Supplementary Protocols][[other programme-specific legal acts]].
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to [the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the
right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of persons, the right to
non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the environment and high levels of human health
protection].
Before the beginning of an action task raising an ethical issue, the beneficiaries must have obtained all
approvals or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any (national or
local) ethics committee or other bodies [such as data protection authorities].
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting
authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary, which shows
that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the conclusions of the committee or
authority concerned (if any).]
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14) (HE, RFCS)
[OPTION for programmes with specific ethics and research integrity rules: Ethics and research integrity
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
- ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity) and
- applicable EU, international and nationallaw, including the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its
Supplementary Protocols.
No funding can be granted, within or outside the EU, for activities that are prohibited in all Member States.
No funding can be granted in a Member State for an activity which is forbiddenin that Member State.
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the
right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of persons, the right to
non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the environment and high levels of human health
protection.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action have an exclusive focus on civil
applications.
350EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action do not:
- aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes
- intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such modifications
heritable (with the exception of research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads, which may be
financed)
- intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell
procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or
- lead to the destruction of human embryos (for example, for obtaining stem cells).
[Activities involving research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells may be carried out only
if:
- they are set out in Annex 1 or
- the coordinator has obtained explicit approval (in writing) from the granting authority.]
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the fundamental principle of research integrity —as set out in the
European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity59.
This implies compliance with the following principles:
- reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis
and the use of resources
- honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a
transparent, fair and unbiased way
- respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the
environment
- accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organisation, for
training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts
and means that beneficiaries must ensure that persons carrying out research tasks follow the good research
practices including ensuring, where possible, openness, reproducibility and traceability and refrain from the
research integrity violations described in the Code.
Activities raising ethical issues must comply with the additional requirements formulated by the ethics
panels (including after checks, reviews or audits; see Article 25).
Before starting an action task raising ethical issues, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals or
other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any (national or local) ethics
committee or other bodies such as data protection authorities.
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting
authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary, which shows
that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the conclusions of the committee or
authority concerned (if any).
59 European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity of ALLEA (All European Academies).
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on ethics (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
351EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Some programmes with ethics-sensitive calls (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI) also have specific provisions on ethics in Annex 5.
Depending on the programme, the obligations may vary.
2. Ethical principles and applicable law (HE, RFCS)
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
− ethical principles (including, where applicable the highest standards of research
integrity) and
− applicable international, EU and national law.
The main ethical principles depend on the domain. For research and innovation related
domains, they are:
Main ethical principles:
▪ Respecting human dignity and integrity
▪ Ensuring honesty and transparency towards research subjects and notably
getting free and informed consent (as well as assent whenever relevant)
▪ Protecting vulnerable persons
▪ Ensuring privacy and confidentiality
▪ Promoting justice and inclusiveness
▪ Minimising harm and maximising benefit
▪ Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially if the research
is being carried out in developing countries
▪ Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction
and refinement (‘3Rs’) in animal research
▪ Respecting and protecting the environment and future generations
The key sources of EU and international law are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols (for
other texts). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (UN CRPD). In addition, some programmes mention sector-specific legislation
(such as, for instance, the EU Directives on animal health and organic-labelling for EMFAF).
3. Exclusive focus on civil applications (HE and RFCS)
For programmes with this provision (HE and RFCS), the activities under the action must have
an exclusive focus on civil applications.
This does not mean that the research results cannot peripherally be useful in a military
context. Research related to dual-use products or technologies (usually used for civilian
purposes but with possible military applications) is not prohibited (e.g. development of an
algorithm that might also be used for optimising military logistics). However, activities that
focus on military applications will NOT be funded (e.g. development of a robot designed for
military intervention).
4. Prohibited activities and activities involving research on human embryos or
human embryonic stem cells (HE)
Prohibited activities may not take place under the action.
352EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Activities that involve human embryos (hE) or human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can only
be funded, if:
− they comply with the Statement by the Commission on research activities involving
human embryos or human embryonic stem cells54 (in particular, do NOT result in the
destruction of human embryos)
and
− they are set out in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement or
− the coordinator has obtained explicit approval by the granting authority.
These activities are de facto considered as raising sensitive ethics issues and must always
undergo an ethics assessment (see below) that can lead to ethics requirements that will be
included in Annex 1.
5. Research integrity (HE and RFCS)
In order to meet the highest standards of research integrity, the beneficiaries must follow the
principles listed in this provision and ensure that the persons carrying out research tasks
comply with the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (i.e. follow the good
research practices listed in this Code and refrain from any research integrity violations it
describes).
They also must ensure that appropriate procedures, policies and structures are in place to
foster responsible research practices, to prevent questionable research practices and
research misconduct, and to handle allegations of breaches of the principles and standards in
the Code of Conduct (see Guidelines for Promoting Research Integrity in Research Performing
Organisation).
Fundamental research integrity principles:
▪ reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the
methodology, the analysis and the use of resources
▪ honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating
research in a transparent, fair and unbiased way
▪ respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural
heritage and the environment
▪ accountability for the research from the idea to publication, for its management
and organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider
impacts.
The Code constitutes a general reference framework and takes into account the legitimate
interests of the beneficiaries (i.e. regarding IPRs and data sharing). This does not change the
other obligations under this Agreement or obligations under applicable international, EU or
national law, all of which still apply.
In addition, beneficiaries should rely on local, national or discipline-specific guidelines, if such
documents exist and are not contrary to the Code.

6. Activities raising ethics issues (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
For these programmes, proposals may have to undergo an ethics review before selection and
will, if one or more ethics issues are identified, be made subject to ethics requirements to be
solved immediately or implement during the grant. In the latter case, they will be included
as deliverables in Annex 1.
Examples (ethics issues): involvement of patients, volunteers, children or vulnerable
populations; use of human (embryonic) stem cells; implication of developing countries; collecting
and processing of personal data; use of animals; risk of environmental impact.
Examples (ethics deliverables): to submit to the granting authority a report on certain ethics
issues during the course of the action.
Examples (ethics requirements before grant signature): confirmation personal data of this
study will not be transferred outside the EU.
In addition, beneficiaries must obtain — before starting an action task raising ethical issues —
all the necessary ethics opinions, notifications and authorisations. These documents do not
need to be submitted, but must be kept on file and provided on request (in case of ethics
reviews, checks or audits). They must be able to show that the
opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the tasks to be undertaken in the context of the
action. If the documents are not in English, beneficiaries may be asked to provide an English
summary.
Best practice: When preparing the applications for such opinions/notifications/ authorisations,
beneficiaries should request the assistance of ethics experts, research ethics
departments/committees and of their organisation’s data protection officer.
The granting authority may carry out ethics checks or reviews to ensure that the beneficiaries
have properly implemented the ethics requirements and obtained the
opinions/notifications/authorisations (see Article 25).
Specific cases (ethics):
Activities carried out in a non-EU country — Such activities must comply with the laws of
that country AND be allowed in at least one EU Member State. The beneficiaries must sign
the related declaration in their application.

VALUES (— ARTICLE 14) (HE, RFCS)
[OPTION for programmes with gender rules: Gender mainstreaming
The beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities between men and women in the
implementation of the action and, where applicable, in line with the gender equality plan. They must aim, to
the extent possible, for a gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the action, including at
supervisory and managerial level.]
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on EU values (HE and RFCS)
For some programmes (HE and RFCS), Annex 5 includes specific provisions on EU values.
2. Gender mainstreaming (HE and RFCS)
The beneficiaries must take all measures:
− to promote gender equality, i.e. equal opportunities between men and women in the
implementation of the action, and
− in line with their gender equality plan (GEP), if applicable.
Promote gender equality:
The beneficiaries should:
− aim for a balanced participation of women and men in their research teams
− being proactive in ensuring gender balance among the individuals who are primarily
responsible for carrying out the work (in accordance with the categories defined in
the monitoring system)
− being proactive in promoting gender equality among consortium members and
participants in the implementation of the action.
Examples (measures to promote gender equality within a project): Transparency of
recruitment and advancement processes, including gender-sensitive language in vacancies and job-
descriptions; plans and conditions for career advancement; transparent gender equal wage
classification and grading of jobs; development of leadership opportunities; gender planning and
budgeting; gender impact assessment of policies; climate surveys of institutions; trainings on
unconscious gender biases in recruitment and assessment of researchers, as well as in
collaborative work; adoption of family-friendly policies; promotion of gender-sensitive mobility and
dual-career couples schemes; measures to prevent and address gender based violence such as
sexual harassment.
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must aim — to the extent possible —
for a gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the action, including at the
supervisory and managerial levels.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken and measures put in place (see Article 20).
355EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In addition, the gender dimension should be integrated in research and innovation content.
This is a by default requirement for all Horizon Europe RIA/IA and Programme Cofund
actions, with some exceptions.
For more guidance on gender equality, including the integration of the gender dimension into
research and innovation content, see HE Programme Guide > Gender equality.
Gender equality plan:
The gender equality plan (GEP) is an eligibility criterion for participating in Horizon Europe
actions for legal entities from Member States and HE associated countries that are:
− public bodies
− research organisations
− higher education establishments.
The ‘gender equality plan’ is a document that sets out the gender equality strategy of an
organisation.
The GEP does not apply to other types of legal entities e.g. private for-profit organisations,
including SMEs, non-governmental or civil society organisations.
The GEP (or equivalent document) must cover the following minimum process-related
requirements:
− publication: a formal document published on the institution’s website and endorsed
by the top management. Endorsement can refer to the signature of the document, the
minutes of the management meeting where the decision was taken, a press release
informing about its approval or a document having a foreword and/or other form of
top management statement.
− dedicated resources: commitment of resources to implement the plan
− data collection and monitoring: regular (at least once in two years) collection of
sex/gender disaggregated data on personnel (and students, for the establishments
concerned) as well as regular (at least once in two years) reporting based on
indicators
− training: awareness raising/training on gender equality for staff and decision-makers.
Content-wise, the GEP should address the following areas, using concrete measures and
targets:
− work-life balance and organisational culture
− gender balance in leadership and decision-making
− gender equality in recruitment and career progression
− integration of the gender dimension into research and teaching content
− measures against gender-based violence, including sexual harassment.
Costs relating to the GEP (including for its implementation/updates) are NOT eligible (since
they relate to an eligibility criterion for participating).
More information on the GEP in Horizon Europe is available here and in these FAQ.

protecting or exploiting the results, including by scientific [or professional] publications
in any medium.
Exploit(ation) — The use of results in further [innovation and deployment] activities other than those
covered by the action concerned, including among other things, commercial exploitation
such as developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, creating
and providing a service, or in standardisation activities.
Fair and reasonable conditions — Appropriate conditions, including possible financial terms or royalty-free
conditions, taking into account the specific circumstances of the request for access, for

requested and/or the scope, duration or other characteristics of the exploitation
envisaged.
List of background [— Background free from restrictions]
The beneficiaries must, where industrial and intellectual property rights (including rights of third parties)
exist prior to the Agreement, establish a list of these pre-existing industrial and intellectual property rights,
specifying the rights owners.
The coordinator must — before starting the action — submit this list to the granting authority.
[Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic autonomy reasons,
background that is subject to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not
one of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the results (i.e.
would make the results subject to control or restrictions) must not be used and must be explicitly excluded in
the list of background — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.]
[Results free from restrictions
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to [security or EU strategic autonomy reasons],
the beneficiaries must ensure that the results of the action are not subject to control or other restrictions by a
country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the
call conditions — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.]
Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them (unless the consortium agreement specifies another
ownership regime).
[For […] however, two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:
- they have jointly generated them and
- it is not possible to:
- establish the respective contribution of each beneficiary, or
- separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection.
The joint owners must agree — in writing — on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership
(‘joint ownership agreement’), to ensure compliance with their obligations under this Agreement.]
Protection of results
The beneficiaries must adequately protect their results — for an appropriate period and with appropriate
territorial coverage — if protection is possible and justified, taking into account all relevant considerations,
including the prospects for commercial exploitation, legitimate interests of the other beneficiaries and any
other legitimate interests.
[Exploitation of results
Beneficiaries must — up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) — use their best
efforts to exploit their results directly or to have them exploited indirectly by another entity, in particular
through transfer or licensing.
358EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
[Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic autonomy reasons
(and unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority), the beneficiaries must produce a significant
amount of products, services or processes that incorporate results of the action or that are produced through
the use of results of the action in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.
Where the call conditions impose moreover a first exploitation obligation, the first exploitation must also
take place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.
The beneficiaries must ensure that these obligations also apply to their affiliated entities, associated partners,
[third parties giving in-kind contributions,] subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third
parties.] ]

Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic autonomy reasons,
the beneficiaries may not transfer ownership of their results [or grant licences] to third parties which are
established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or
are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless they have requested and received
prior approval by the granting authority.
The request must:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner and the planned or potential exploitation of the results and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer [or license] on the [security
interests or EU strategic autonomy].
The granting authority may request additional information.

obligations under this Agreement (in particular, by obtaining the necessary licences and authorisations from
the rights holders concerned).
Access rights for the granting authority EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies [and national authorities]
to results for policy purposes
The beneficiaries must grant access to their results — on a royalty-free basis — to the granting authority,
other EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, for developing, implementing and monitoring EU policies
or programmes. [Such access does not extend to beneficiaries’ background.]
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
[The access rights also extend to national authorities of EU Member States or associated countries, for
developing, implementing and monitoring their policies or programmes in this area. In this case, access is
subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency (including the granting
authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.]
[Access rights for the granting authority to results in case of a public emergency
If requested by the granting authority in case of a public emergency, the beneficiaries must grant non-
exclusive, world-wide licences to third parties — under fair and reasonable conditions — to use the results to
address the public emergency.]
[Access rights for third parties to ensure continuity and interoperability
Where the call conditions impose continuity or interoperability obligations, the beneficiaries must make the
[materials, documents and information] [and] [results] produced in the framework of the action available to
the public (freely accessible on the Internet under [open licences] [or] [open source licences]).]
Access rights for national authorities to the special report for use by/for armed forces or security or
intelligence forces
For Research Actions, the beneficiaries must grant access to the special report — on a royalty-free basis — to
national authorities of EU Member States or associated countries for use by/for their armed forces or security
or intelligence forces (including in the framework of cooperative programmes).
‘Special report’ means the specific deliverable summarising the results of a research project and providing
information on the basic principles, aims, outcomes, basic properties, tests performed, potential benefits,
potential defence applications and expected exploitation path of the research towards development. It may
also include information on the ownership of IPRs.
Access to the special report will be granted by the granting authority, after having ensured that appropriate
confidentiality obligations are in place.
Access rights for third parties to further develop results
For Research Actions, the beneficiaries must grant access — on a royalty-free basis — to results which are
necessary for the execution of other EU grants or contracts between national authorities of two or more EU
Member States or associated countries and one or more beneficiaries, to further develop together results
generated by the action.
In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.]

RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE (— ARTICLE 16) (HE, RFCS)
[OPTION for programmes with specific IPR rules:
Definitions
Access rights — Rights to use results or background.
Dissemination — The public disclosure of the results by appropriate means, other than resulting from
protecting or exploiting the results, including by scientific publications in any medium.
Exploit(ation) — The use of results in further research and innovation activities other than those covered by
the action concerned, including among other things, commercial exploitation such as
developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product orprocess, creating and
providing a service, or in standardisation activities.
Fair and reasonable conditions — Appropriate conditions, including possible financial terms or royalty-free
conditions, taking into account the specific circumstances of the request for access, for
example the actual or potential value of the results or background to which access is
requested and/or the scope, duration or other characteristics of the exploitation envisaged.
FAIR principles — ‘findability’, ‘accessibility’, ‘interoperability’ and ‘reusability’.
Open access — Online access to research outputs provided free of charge to the end-user.
Open science — An approach to the scientific process based on open cooperative work, tools and diffusing
knowledge.
Research data management — The process within the research lifecycle that includes the organisation,
storage, preservation, security, quality assurance, allocation of persistent identifiers (PIDs)
and rules and procedures for sharing of data including licensing.
Research outputs — Results to which access can be given in the form of scientific publications, data or other
engineered results and processes such as software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows
and electronic notebooks.
[Scope of the obligations
For this section, references to ‘beneficiary’or ‘beneficiaries’do not include affiliated entities (if any).]
[Agreement on background — Background free from restrictions
The beneficiaries must identify in a written agreement the background as needed for implementing the action
or for exploiting its results.
Where the call conditions restrict control due to strategic interests reasons, background that is subject to
control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries
or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the exploitation of the results (i.e. would
make the exploitation of the results subject to control or restrictions) must not be used and must be explicitly
excluded in the agreement on background —unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.]
[Results free from restrictions
Where the call conditions restrict control due to strategic interests reasons, the beneficiaries must ensure that
the results of the action are not subject to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country)
which is not one of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions — unless otherwise
agreed with the granting authority.]
Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them.[[…]]
361EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
[However, two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:
- they have jointly generated them and
- it is not possible to:
- establishthe respective contribution of each beneficiary, or
- separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection.
The joint owners must agree —in writing —on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership
(‘joint ownership agreement’), to ensure compliance with their obligations under this Agreement.
Unless otherwise agreed in the joint ownership agreement or consortium agreement, each joint owner may
grant non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the jointly-owned results (without any right to sub-
license), if the other joint owners are given:
- at least 45 days advance notice and
- fair and reasonable compensation.
The joint owners may agree —in writing —to apply another regime than joint ownership.
If third parties (including employees and other personnel) may claim rights to the results, the beneficiary
concerned must ensure that those rights can be exercised in a manner compatible with its obligations under
the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must indicate the owner(s) of the results (results ownership list) in the final periodic
report.]
Protection of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must adequately protect their results —for an
appropriate period and with appropriate territorial coverage —if protection is possible and justified, taking
into account all relevant considerations, including the prospects for commercial exploitation, the legitimate
interests of the other beneficiaries and any other legitimate interests.
Exploitation of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must —up to four years after the end of the action
(see Data Sheet, Point 1) —use their best efforts to exploit their results directly or to have them exploited
indirectly by another entity, in particular through transfer or licensing.
[If, despite a beneficiary’s best efforts, the results are not exploited within one year after the end of the
action, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the granting authority) use the Horizon
Results Platform to find interested parties to exploit the results.
If results are incorporated in a standard, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed with the granting
authority or unless it is impossible) ask the standardisation body to include the funding statement (see Article
17) in (information related to) the standard.]
[Additional exploitation obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations (including obligations linked to the
restriction of participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons), the
beneficiaries must comply with them —up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency, the
beneficiaries must (if requested by the granting authority) grant for a limited period of time specified in the
request,non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable conditions — to their results to legal entities that
need the results to address the public emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting
products and services at fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after the end
of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
362EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Additional information obligation relating to standards
Where the call conditions impose additional informationobligations relating to possible standardisation,the
beneficiaries must —up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —inform the
granting authority, if the results could reasonably be expected to contribute to European or international
standards.
Transfer and licensing of results
Transfer of ownership
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect compliance with their
obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under the Agreement regarding their results are passed on
to the new owner and that this new owner has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer.
Moreover, they must inform the other beneficiaries with access rights of the transfer at least 45 days in
advance (or less if agreed in writing), unless agreed otherwise in writing for specifically identified third
parties including affiliated entities or unless impossible under the applicable law. This notification must
include sufficient information on the new owner to enable the beneficiaries concerned to assess the effects on
their access rights. The beneficiaries may object within 30 days of receiving notification (or less if agreed in
writing), if they can show that the transfer would adversely affect their access rights. In this case, the transfer
may not take place until agreement has been reached between the beneficiaries concerned.
Granting licences
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results (or otherwise give the right to exploit them), including on
an exclusive basis, provided this does not affect compliance with their obligations.
Exclusive licences for results may be granted only if all the other beneficiaries concerned have waived their
access rights.
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing [— Horizon Europe actions]
Where the call conditions in Horizon Europe actions provide for the right to object to transfers or licensing,
the granting authority may — up to [four][[…]] years after the endof the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —
object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results, if:
- [the beneficiaries which generated the results have received funding under the grant]
- it is to a legal entity established in a non-EU country not associated with Horizon Europe, and
- the granting authority considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests.
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting
authority before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation of the results,
and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU interests, in
particular regarding competitiveness as well as consistency with [ethical principles and security
considerations].
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the granting authority decides to object to a transfer or exclusive licence, it must formally notify the
beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information it has
requested).
363EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
No transfer or licensing may take place in the following cases:
- pending the granting authority decision, within the period set out above
- if the granting authority objects
- until the conditions are complied with, if the granting authority objection comes with conditions.
A beneficiary may formally notify a request to waive the right to object regarding intended transfers or grants
to a specifically identified third party, if measures safeguarding EU interests are in place. If the granting
authority agrees, it will formally notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or
any additional information requested).
[Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing — Euratom actions
Where the call conditions in Euratom actions provide for the right to object to transfers or licensing,the
granting authority may — up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —object to a
transfer of ownership or the exclusive or non-exclusive licensing of results, if:
- the beneficiaries which generated the results have received funding under the grant
- it is to a legal entity established in a non-EU country not associated to the Euratom Research and
Training Programme 2021-2025 and
- the granting authority considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with the EU interests.
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant a licence must formally notify the granting authority
before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the results, the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation of
the results, and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU interests, in
particular regarding competitiveness as well as consistency with ethical principles and security
considerations (including the defence interests of the EU Member States under Article 24 of the
Euratom Treaty).
The granting authoritymay request additional information.
If the granting authoritydecides to object to a transfer or licence, it will formally notify the beneficiary
concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information requested).
No transfer or licensing may take place in the following cases:
- pending the granting authoritydecision, within the period set out above
- if the granting authorityobjects
- until the conditions are complied with, if the granting authority objection comes with conditions.
A beneficiary may formally notify a request to waive the right to object regarding intended transfers or grants
to a specifically identified third party, if measures safeguarding EU interests are in place. If the granting
authority agrees, it will formally notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or
any additional information requested).]
[Limitations to transfers and licensing due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons of the
EU and its Member States
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons, the beneficiaries may not transfer ownership of their results or grant licences to third parties
which are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions(or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless they
have requested and received prior approval by the granting authority.
364EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The request must:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation of the results,
and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or license on the [strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States].
The granting authority may request additional information.]
Access rights to results and background
[Exercise of access rights — Waiving of access rights — No sub-licensing
Requests to exercise access rights and the waiver of access rights must be in writing.
Unless agreed otherwise in writing with the beneficiary granting access, access rights do not include the right
to sub-license.
If a beneficiary is no longer involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant access.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary no longer has
access rights.]
[Access rights for implementing the action
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —on a royalty-free basis —to background needed to
implement their own tasks under the action, unless the beneficiary that holds the background has —before
acceding to the Agreement —:
- informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is subject to restrictions, or
- agreed with the other beneficiaries that access would not be ona royalty-free basis.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —on a royalty-free basis —to results needed for
implementing their own tasks under the action.]
[Access rights for exploiting the results
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —under fair and reasonable conditions —to results needed for
exploiting their results.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —under fair and reasonable conditions —to background
needed for exploiting their results, unless the beneficiary thatholds the background has —before acceding to
the Agreement —informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is subject to restrictions.
Requests for access must be made —unless agreed otherwise in writing —up to one year after the end of the
action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
[Access rights for entities under the same control
Unless agreed otherwise in writing by the beneficiaries, access to results and, subject to the restrictions
referred to above (if any), background must also be granted —under fair and reasonable conditions —to
entities that:
- are established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe associated country
- are under the direct or indirect control of another beneficiary, or under the same direct or indirect
control as that beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling that beneficiary and
- need the access to exploit the results of that beneficiary.
Unless agreed otherwise in writing, such requests for access must be made by the entity directly to the
beneficiary concerned.
Requests for access must be made —unless agreed otherwise in writing —up to one year after the end of the
action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
365EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
[Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and national authorities
to results for policy purposes [— Horizon Europe actions]
[In Horizon Europe actions,] the beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must grant access
to their results —on a royalty-free basis —to the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or
agencies for developing, implementing and monitoring EU policies or programmes. Such access rights do not
extend to beneficiaries’ background.
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
For actions under the cluster ‘Civil Security for Society’, such access rights also extend to national
authorities of EU Member States for developing, implementing and monitoring their policies or programmes
in this area. In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency (including the granting
authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.]
[Access rights for the granting authority, Euratom institutions, funding bodies or the Joint Undertaking
Fusion for Energy — Euratom actions
In Euratom actions, the beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must grant access to their
results —on a royalty-free basis —to the granting authority, Euratom institutions, funding bodies or the Joint
Undertaking Fusion for Energy for developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and
programmes or for compliance with obligations assumed through international cooperation with non-EU
countries and international organisations.
Such access rights include the right to authorise third parties to use the results in public procurement and the
right to sub-license and are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.]
Additional access rights
Where the call conditions impose additional access rights, the beneficiaries must comply with them.]
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on IPR, background and results (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules regarding background and results and linked
intellectual property rights.
Most programmes use the standard set of additional rules concerning rights of use by the
granting authority of results for information, communication, dissemination and publicity
purposes. Some programmes (especially HE, RFCS, DEP and EDF) use more customised
provisions that may vary from programme to programme.
For Horizon Europe, the references to ‘beneficiary’ or ‘beneficiaries’ in this section do NOT
include affiliated entities. However, there are specific access rights provisions for entities under the
same control in line with the HE Regulation 2021/695 (e.g. for access rights).
2. List of background (some programmes)
366EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Programmes with actions that rely a lot on pre-existing data, know-how or information
including linked intellectual property rights, have a provision obliging the beneficiaries to
establish a so-called ‘list of background’. This list should include both background owned by
project participants and rights owned by third parties. It will allow the consortium to make
sure that everyone has the rights they need for their part of the project.
Depending on the programme, the list remains either consortium-internal or must be shared
with the granting authority (usually before starting the action).
3. Rights of use on results for information, communication, dissemination and
publicity purposes (most programmes)
Most programmes contain a provision allowing the granting authority to use results for
information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes.
This concerns only non-sensitive information and aims mainly the communication and
dissemination activities that are part of the programme management (e.g. press
communications, stakeholder consultations, results portals, media and web-presence, etc).
4. Agreement on background (some programmes)
For some programmes, the list of background must be defined in a written agreement, in
which the beneficiaries identify and agree on what constitutes background for their action.
This list will be the basis for the access obligations.
Specific cases (background):
Limitations to use of background due to security or strategic interests (restricted
calls) (HE, DEP, EDF) — Where the work programme/call conditions provide for restricted
participation (e.g. due to security or strategic interests reasons), background that is subject
to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the
eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that would impact the
exploitation of the results should normally not be used (if possible).
The precise scope of this provision depends on the programme. Please cross-check with
the Grant Agreement you signed!
‘Background that impacts the exploitation of results’ should be understood as making the
exploitation of those results subject to control or restrictions, for example if exploitation
would require the agreement of the entity owning the background. If such background needs
to be used, this must first be agreed with the granting authority.
5. Ownership of results (HE)
Results belong to the beneficiary that generated/produced them (see Article 16.2).
Best practice: To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, keep documents such as laboratory
notebooks to show who produced the results, how and when.
If others (‘third parties’) could claim rights on results, the beneficiaries must ensure that they
can respect their obligations under the grant by making arrangements (transfers, licences,
other) with the third parties (e.g. affiliated entities, associated partners, associated partners
linked to a beneficiary in MSCA, employees, subcontractors, other members of Joint research
units (JRUs), etc). Such arrangements could be separate between the beneficiaries and the
third party, or in the consortium agreement if they concern affiliated entities or associated
partners. If making such arrangements is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using
the third party to generate the results.
Examples (third parties that may claim rights): academic institutions in countries that have a
kind of ‘professor’s privilege’ system (according to which researchers may have some rights to the
367EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
results of university research); employees or students who carry out work for the action (if they
have rights under national law or their contract); beneficiaries for which affiliated entities carry out
a part of the work.
Examples (arrangements): transferring (partial) ownership to the beneficiary; granting access
rights to the beneficiary with a right to sub-license.
The list of owners of the results generated by the action must be provided to the granting
authority at the end of the action in the final reporting (results ownership list (ROL)).
In case of joint ownership, all joint owners must be listed even if (some of) the joint owners
are not members of the consortium. The results ownership list provides a snapshot in time,
meaning that ownership changes may happen after the submission of the final periodic
report.
If the ownership of the results is not clear, the beneficiaries should indicate all potential
owners.
Example: A beneficiary is involved in a legal dispute on the ownership.
Specific cases (ownership of results):
Results generated by associated partners — For results generated by associated
partners, the situation is similar to that of beneficiaries not having received funds within the
meaning of the HE Regulation 2021/695. Provisions in the Annex 5 that apply only to
‘beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant’ do NOT apply (e.g. the obligation
to protect the results or the best efforts obligation to exploit the results). Respect of all other
obligations (e.g. obligation to provide access if needed to implement the project or exploit the
results or obligations related to dissemination/open science) must be ensured.
Automatic joint ownership — If beneficiaries have jointly generated results and it is not
possible to establish their respective contribution or to separate them for protection, the
beneficiaries automatically become joint owners.
In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must conclude a joint ownership agreement (in
writing).
This agreement should cover in particular:
Joint ownership agreement content:
▪ how the ownership is divided (e.g. equally or not).
▪ if/how the joint results will be protected, including issues related to the cost of
protection (e.g. patent filing and examination fees, renewal fees, prior state-of-
the-art searches, infringement actions, etc), or to the sharing of revenues or
profits.
▪ how the joint results will be exploited and disseminated.
▪ how disputes will be settled (e.g. via a mediator, applicable law, etc).
Best practice: Include at least general principles on joint ownership already in the consortium
agreement to make it easier to negotiate a full joint ownership agreement later on.
Unless otherwise provided in the consortium agreement or the joint ownership agreement,
the joint owners automatically have the right to grant non-exclusive licences to third parties
against fair and reasonable compensation (without prior authorisation from the other joint
owners). The joint owner that intends to grant the licence must give the other joint owners at
least 45 days advance notice (together with sufficient information, to check if the proposed
compensation is fair and reasonable). Such licences may not include sub-licensing.
368EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The joint owners may agree in writing not to continue with joint ownership and apply another
regime.
Example: The joint owners may transfer ownership to a single owner and agree on more
favourable access rights (or on any other fair counterpart). In such case, the rules regarding
transfer of ownership apply.
The joint owners may agree to apply another regime even before the results are generated,
e.g. in the consortium agreement, if they consider it appropriate.
Joint ownership by agreement — Outside the cases described above, the beneficiaries
may also become joint owners if they specifically agree on it.
Example: A beneficiary may decide that a part of its results will be owned jointly with its parent
company or another third party. Also in this case, the rules regarding transfer or ownership apply.
6. Protection of results (HE)
‘Beneficiaries having received funding under the grant’ must:
– examine the possibility of protecting their results and
– if possible and justified taking into account all relevant considerations, protect them.
Examples (no protection necessary): If protection is impossible under EU or national law or not
justified (in view of the absence of potential for commercial or industrial exploitation, if the action’s
objective does not require protection, if additionally protecting a part of certain technology would
not bring significantly broader protection, etc)
Beneficiaries are in principle free to choose any available form of protection, but protection
should be adequate depending on the characteristics of the results to ensure effective
protection. While some forms of IP protection, such as copyright, do not require registration,
others, such as patent, trade marks or industrial design require the filing of an application
before the relevant registration body. Although important for commercial and industrial
exploitation, IP protection is not mandatory, if not justified.
Standard forms of protection:
▪ Patent
▪ Trademark
▪ Industrial design
▪ Copyright
Examples: Protection for a design: e.g. industrial design, copyright.
In some cases, it may be advisable to protect an invention by keeping it confidential as a
trade secret, or to postpone the filing of a patent (or other IPR) application.
Example (better not to protect for the moment): Keeping an invention (temporarily)
confidential could allow further development of the invention while avoiding the negative
consequences associated with premature filing (earlier priority and filing dates, early publication,
possible rejection due to lack of support or industrial applicability, etc) but this requires careful
consideration given the possible risks of such an approach.
Best practice: Consider seeking expert advice to help you to decide whether and how to
protect results.
Costs related to protection are eligible, if they fulfil the cost eligibility conditions set out in
Article 6.
369EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
When deciding on protection, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’
legitimate interests. Any other beneficiary invoking legitimate interests must demonstrate
how the decision would harm them. The mere fact that the protection would establish an
exclusive right which could affect beneficiaries which are competitors is not a legitimate
interest.
Example (harm): The protection could lead to the disclosure of valuable background that is held
by the other beneficiary (as a trade secret or flagged as confidential) and may require coordination.
Best practice: Although beneficiaries are not required to consult other beneficiaries before
deciding whether to protect their results or not, it may be advisable to provide for
arrangements (either in the consortium agreement or in separate agreements), to ensure
that where needed decisions on protection take due account of the interests of all
beneficiaries concerned.
Protection should last for an appropriate period and have appropriate territorial coverage (in
view of potential) commercial or industrial exploitation and other elements (e.g. potential
markets and countries in which potential competitors are located).
Patent applications should identify the rightful inventors.
Example (not rightful inventor): An entity systematically designates a head of department as
one of the inventors, although it is not true.
Be aware that errors (or fraud) in identifying inventors may lead to the invalidation of
the patent.
7. Exploitation of results (HE)
The beneficiaries must take measures aiming to ensure the exploitation of their results —
either by themselves (e.g. a beneficiary owning results uses them directly) or indirectly by
others (other beneficiaries or third parties, e.g. through licensing or by transferring the
ownership of results).
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific
measures to try to ensure that their results are exploited (to the extent possible and
justified).
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken (see Article 20).
Security obligations — Exploitation must be compliant with other grant obligations,
such as security rules (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
Where possible, these measures should be consistent with the impact expected from the
action and the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results. The exploitation of
results should take into consideration the objectives of the Horizon Europe Programme (see
specific objectives in Article 3(2) of the HE Regulation 2021/695), including promoting
innovation in the EU and strengthening the European Research Area.
The ’plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities’
is a document that details the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that
will be carried out during the project (or afterwards) , to achieve the expected impact.
All proposals must (unless explicitly excluded by the work programme/call conditions),
include a first version of the plan (summary of the planned activities under the description of
the impact pathways). If successful, the projects will then have to provide the complete plan
for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities (normally
within the first six months of the action and then regularly update it). Moreover, beneficiaries
370EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
will have to report on the activities undertaken. See Annex 5 > Communication,
dissemination and visibility.
‘Exploitation’ (as defined at the beginning of Annex 5) means the use of results in further
research and innovation activities other than those covered by the action concerned,
including among other things, commercial exploitation such as developing, creating,
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in
standardisation activities.
Exploitation can also be non commercial, for example use in non-commercial research
or non-commercial teaching activities. When results of the action are used to influence R&I
policy or decision making, this is another form of exploitation.
Best practice: Consider applying for dissemination and exploitation support services,
including go to market support and IP management provided by the European Commission,
during and after the end of your action i.e. the Horizon Results Booster. This service is
available to all running and finished projects.
The best effort obligation applies only to ‘beneficiaries having received funding under the
grant’ and applies during the action and up to four years after the end of the action.
Specific case (exploitation of results):
Additional exploitation obligations (HE) — Where the work programme/call conditions
provide for additional exploitation obligations, those obligations must also be complied
with/fulfilled (by ALL beneficiaries, unless explicitly stated otherwise).
Additional information obligation relating to standards (HE) — Where the work
programme/call conditions provide for this additional obligation, the beneficiaries must
moreover inform the granting authority on any results that could contribute to European or
international standards.
Example: The results are produced in an area in which standards play an important role (such as
in mobile communication, diagnostics or immunological diseases).
Public emergency — Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional
exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency, when requested by the granting
authority, the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences under fair and reasonable
conditions to legal entities that need the results to address the public emergency and commit
to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services at fair and reasonable
conditions.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. for HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Be also aware that for calls specifically addressing a public emergency, the additional
exploitation obligations may already have been activated directly in the work
programme/call conditions. In this case, there will normally not be an additional request by
the granting authority.
‘Public emergencies’ are emergencies characterised by an unexpected genuine and
sufficiently serious threat undermining EU security, public order or public health.
Examples: Public emergencies could cover events such as pandemic diseases (like Covid-19),
terrorist attacks, hacking, earthquakes, tsunamis, CBRN events, e.g. novel and highly fatal
infectious agents or biological or chemical toxins, as well as those from resulting cascading risks.
371EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The public emergency obligation is a last resort option that will only be activated if the
granting authority considers that the EU security, public order or public health cannot be
protected by any less restrictive measure.
Thus, the granting authority will for instance not request activation of the public emergency
obligation if it considers that the beneficiary is able to address the public emergency themself
and commits to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services directly or
indirectly at fair and reasonable conditions. In most cases the obligation will therefore
probably remain dormant.
In case of activation of the public emergency provision by a request of the granting authority,
the duration of the obligations and the fairness and reasonability of the licences will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the specific circumstances of the public
emergency, the context of each project and the nature of its results.
As this is an additional exploitation obligation, the beneficiary cannot OPT out and must
comply with the additional obligations if requested by the granting authority.
Best practice: If you intend to grant any exclusive licences to results that might be
concerned, you must make sure that the licensing agreement allows for an eventual
activation of the obligation (e.g. that it allows you to suspend the exclusive character and
grant licences).
Horizon Results Platform (HE) — The Horizon Results Platform (HRP) is a platform
developed by the European Commission to help promote the exploitation of the results from
the R&I framework programmes. It allows beneficiaries of grants from FP7, Horizon 2020,
Horizon Europe and Euratom to publish and promote the uptake of their results towards their
target audiences. It can be accessed by beneficiaries through the Portal.
Detailed instructions on how to publish results can be found in the IT How To > Managing
Project Results in the Horizon Results Platform.
Beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to consider the use of this free Platform to their own
benefit, at any stage of the project, during as well as after the end of the project, provided
they have key exploitable results (KER; high potential to be exploited, i.e.to be used in a
product, process or service, or act as an important input to further research, R&I related
policy or education, etc). Results such as outcomes or announcements of consortia meetings,
conferences or other events are not considered as key exploitable results and all project
deliverables are not necessarily key exploitable results either.
Publishing results in the Horizon Results Platform ensures high visibility to a variety of
potential users and stakeholders including industry, academia, investors, public
administrations, etc and may lead to finding help to exploit the results directly (e.g.
financing) or finding third parties which may be interested to exploit the results.
Example: Certain beneficiaries in a project have developed a prototype and have jointly filed for
intellectual property protection, however they do not have the capacity to bring the results to the
market. The beneficiaries concerned published their results on the Horizon Results Platform and a
company signalled its interest to use the technology in its production line. After negotiations, the
beneficiaries agreed to transfer ownership of the prototype and any attached rights to this
company in return for royalties.
The use of the Horizon Results Platform becomes mandatory, if one year after the end of
the action, key exploitable results are not exploited.
Example: Beneficiaries in a project have developed R&I policy recommendations and guidelines to
be used by public authorities in case of water pollution resulting from industrial activities. The
beneficiaries would like to see them being used but despite their best efforts they have not
managed to have local authorities use them. At the latest one year after the end of the grant, the
beneficiaries must publish the policy recommendations on the Horizon Results Platform (with the
372EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
appropriate result type = ‘policy related result’). Publishing them on HRP will provide them visibility
to policymakers from local, regional, national and EU authorities and also regulatory bodies.
However, if justified on the basis of a request of the beneficiary, the obligation to use the
Horizon Results Platform may be waived.
Examples:
1. A beneficiary is intending to exploit certain key exploitable results commercially, either
directly or indirectly, but awaits a marketing authorisation before being able to do so.
2. Two beneficiaries owning results are close to finalising an agreement with a third party to
exploit certain key exploitable results.
3. The Platform cannot be used because of the security recommendations that the project is
subject to.
Using the Platform does NOT mean that the beneficiary concerned should no longer use its best
efforts to exploit its results directly or indirectly via other means.
8. Transfers and licencing of results (HE)
Transfers of ownership:
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect
compliance with their obligations under the Agreement.
Security obligations — Transfer may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are
subject to limited disclosure/dissemination (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security).
In case of transfer, the beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations (regarding the
results) apply to the new owner and that this new owner will pass them on in any subsequent
transfer (e.g. by including this in their arrangements with the new owner).
Obligations that must be extended to new owners:
▪ Possible joint ownership obligations
▪ Protection of results
▪ Exploitation of results
▪ Transfer and licensing of results
▪ Access rights to result
▪ Dissemination of results, open science and visibility of EU funding.
When transferring ownership, they must also consider the other beneficiaries’ legitimate
interests, in particular:
− the beneficiary that intends to make the transfer must give the other beneficiaries
(that still have or still may request access rights) at least 45 days advance notice (or
less if agreed in writing; together with sufficient information to allow them to properly
assess the extent to which their access rights may be affected)
− any other beneficiary (with access rights) may object to the transfer within 30 days of
receiving notification (or less if agreed in writing), if it can show that it would
373EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
adversely affect its access rights; in this case, the transfer may not take place, until
the beneficiaries concerned reach an agreement
The mere fact that the results concerned are transferred to a competitor is NOT in itself a
valid reason for an objection. The beneficiary concerned must demonstrate the adverse
effects on the exercise of its access rights.
Example (adverse effect): Beneficiary A intends to transfer ownership of a new process it
created during the course of an action to a competitor of beneficiary B. If beneficiary B shows that
its access rights would be adversely affected by such a transfer (for instance, because the
competitor has a proven track record of systematically legally challenging beneficiary B’s claims),
the transfer may not take place until the two beneficiaries reach an agreement.
Granting licences:
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results, including on an exclusive basis, provided
this does not affect compliance with their obligations under this Agreement (e.g. they must in
particular ensure that any access rights can be exercised and that any additional exploitation
obligations are/can be complied with).
Security obligations — Licences may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are
subject to limited disclosure/dissemination (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security).
Exclusive licences (e.g. for commercial exploitation) may be granted only if all other
beneficiaries have waived their access rights and other access rights/obligations are
preserved, (e.g. the access rights of the EU, Member States or activation of the public
emergency obligation if applicable).
Specific cases (transfers and licencing of results):
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) — If a transfer of ownership is not explicit (through an
‘intended’ transfer) but part of a take-over or merger of two companies, confidentiality
constraints normally prevail (under M&A rules). Therefore, it may be necessary to inform the
other beneficiaries only after the merger/acquisition took place, instead of before.
Specifically-identified third parties — The beneficiaries may (by prior written agreement)
waive their right to object to transfers of ownership to a specifically-identified third party
(e.g. an affiliate entity of one of them). In this case, there is no need to inform them of such
transfers in advance (and they do not have the right to object).
Before agreeing to such a global authorisation, beneficiaries should carefully consider the
situation (and in particular the identity of the third party concerned), to determine if their
access rights would be affected.
Example: For large industrial groups, it is sometimes clear from the beginning that all results
produced will be transferred to another entity of the group, without being detrimental to the other
beneficiaries (who agreed to the global authorisation).
If the granting authority has the right to object to transfers, the beneficiary must formally
notify the request to waive its right to object in advance (through Portal Formal Notifications:
My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal
Notification) and the granting authority may object.
Joint research units (JRUs) — Where the internal arrangements of a JRU state that any
results produced by one member are owned jointly by all members, the JRU member that is
the beneficiary must ensure that it complies with the obligations on transfers under the Grant
Agreement (placing results under joint ownership of the JRU is a form of transfer).
374EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Common legal structures (CLS) — CLS (i.e. entities representing several other legal
entities, e.g. European Economic Interest Groupings (EEIG) or associations) that are
beneficiaries of an action may want to transfer ownership to one (or more) of their members.
This is not prohibited. However, the normal rules on transfers apply (e.g. access rights have
to remain available).
Best practice: Beneficiaries that are members of a common legal structure are strongly
advised to agree on specific arrangements with the other members of the common legal
structure, in particular relating to ownership and access rights.
Right to object to transfers or exclusive licensing — Where the work programme/call
conditions provide for the right to object, the granting authority may object to transfers or
exclusive licences (or, for Euratom grants, also non-exclusive licences) to legal entities
established in a non-associated third country if the granting authority considers that the
transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. for HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Possible grounds for objection:
▪ Planned transfer/licence not in line with EU competitiveness interests
Example: if the transfer or licence would create a major competitive disadvantage for
European companies or could make the results commercially unavailable on fair and
reasonable conditions in the EU
▪ Planned transfer/licence not consistent with ethical principles
Example: If the transfer or licence could cause the results to be used in a way that is not in
accordance with the fundamental ethical rules and principles recognised at EU and
international level
▪ Planned transfer/licence not consistent with security considerations (including, for
Euratom grants, the Member States’ defence interests under Article 24 of the
Euratom Treaty)
Example: If the transfer or licence could make results considered significant from a
security standpoint not readily available in the EU, or if security-sensitive results could fall
into the hands of third parties that are considered a security risk
▪ Planned transfer/licence weakens the EU scientific and technological bases.
Example: If the transfer or licence could weaken the EU capacity & independence in
strategic technological areas (e.g. quantum computing, artificial intelligence)
This right does NOT apply to results generated by ‘beneficiaries not having received funding
under the grant’.
The beneficiary must formally notify the granting authority in advance of any planned
transfer or exclusive licence (and, for Euratom grants, also of any non-exclusive licence)
through Portal Formal Notifications (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification).
A notification before the results are generated is allowed, if the specific results concerned
(and the details of the transfer/licence) can already be identified so an assessment can be
made.
Right to object waiver for specifically-identified third parties — A beneficiary may
formally notify (through Portal Formal Notifications: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project
375EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
> Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) a request to waive the right to
object regarding intended transfers or grants to a specifically identified third party, if
measures safeguarding EU interests are in place. If the granting authority agrees, it will
formally notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any
additional information requested).
Limitations to transfers and licensing due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy
or security reasons (restricted calls) — Where the work programme/call conditions
provide for restricted participation, prior approval by the granting authority is required
regarding any transfers or (exclusive or non-exclusive) licences to third parties which are
established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries).
9. Access rights to background & results (HE)
What & When? The beneficiaries must provide access to background and results, if it is
needed:
− by another beneficiary, for implementing action tasks or exploiting results
− by an entity established in a EU Member State or HE associated country and under the
direct or indirect control of another beneficiary, or under the same direct or indirect
control as another beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling such a beneficiary,
to exploit the results generated by that beneficiary— unless otherwise agreed or
provided for in other provisions of the Agreement.
Examples: Beneficiary A used background from beneficiary B to generate its results which is
also needed to exploit those results. Beneficiary A would like to use its entity C, a sister
company under the same control as beneficiary, established in a MS to exploit the results. For
this, entity C needs access rights to beneficiary B’s background. If entity C is established in a
Member State or an associated country, it has access rights unless otherwise provided for in the
consortium agreement. If not, the beneficiaries could agree on additional access rights (see
further below).
Other examples (restrictions) may be in relation to security related provisions or in case of
restrictions due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member
States.
There is NO definition of ‘needed’. The beneficiary owning the background or results has to
assess (on a case by case basis and taking into account the action’s specificities), if the
requesting beneficiary needs the access (and may refuse it, if it does not).
Example (results needed for implementation): If without these results, action tasks could
not be implemented, would be significantly delayed or would require significant additional
financial or human resources.
Example (background needed for exploitation): If without these results, exploiting a
result would be technically or legally impossible or if significant additional R&D work would
have to be carried out outside of the action to develop an alternative equivalent solution.
Best practice: To avoid conflicts and where appropriate, agree (e.g. in the consortium
agreement) on a common interpretation of what is needed.
However, for background there is NO (or a more limited) obligation to give access, if there
are restrictions (legal or otherwise) and the beneficiary has informed the others — before
acceding to the grant (or immediately when additional background is agreed on).
Example: A pre-existing agreement (e.g. an exclusive licence) which precludes the granting of
access rights to certain background for exploitation purposes.
By contrast, if a beneficiary contracts on background later, it must ensure that it can comply
with its access obligations under the grant.
376EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The other beneficiaries may waive their access rights, provided that such a waiver is made
in writing.
Best practice: Waivers should be made only on a case-by-case basis, once the results have
been correctly identified and it is clear that access is not needed.
How? Access rights are not automatic; they must be requested (in writing).
Best practice: Use your internal rules (e.g. consortium agreement) to specify how to make
such written requests.
Access may be requested even from beneficiaries who left the action before the end, under
the same conditions as from active beneficiaries. Similarly, if a beneficiary is no longer
involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant access.
If applicable, for entities established in a EU Member State or a HE associated country and
under the direct or indirect control, or under the same direct or indirect the same control as
another beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling such a beneficiary, access must be
requested directly from the beneficiary owning the background or results. However, the
beneficiary owning the background results may agree to a different arrangement.
Access to results for exploitation may be requested up to one year after the end of the action
— unless the beneficiaries agreed on another time limit.
The agreement by the beneficiary owning the results (on the request for access) may be in
any form (tacit, explicit, in writing or oral).
Best practice: To keep a record of entities that have access, a written agreement may be
needed, in particular for important background or results.
In case of disagreement, the requesting beneficiary can better substantiate its request,
withdraw it or resort to the conflict resolution procedures foreseen by the consortium (e.g. in
the consortium agreement). If a conflict on access rights to results is likely to affect the
action implementation, the beneficiaries must immediately inform the granting authority.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary
no longer has access rights.
Conditions for access:
Royalty free — Fair and reasonable conditions
Access to results must be given:
– for the implementation of action tasks: royalty-free
– for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions.
Examples (monetary compensation): A lump sum, a royalty percentage, or a combination
of both.
Examples (non-financial terms): A requirement to grant access to technology it has, or to
agree on cooperation in a different field or in a future project.
Best practice: In case financial terms are involved, it may not be always possible to
determine, at the moment of agreeing to these terms, what fair and reasonable financial
conditions are, since the potential value of the foreground or background and the ways of
exploitation may not be clear. Beneficiaries could in such cases opt for an open system which
allows them to take into account unexpected developments, for example by adjusting royalty
percentages in case certain milestones are reached.
377EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The conditions for access to background are slightly different. Unless restrictions apply,
access must be given:
– for the implementation of action tasks: the default rule is royalty-free
However, if agreed by the beneficiaries before the grant is signed, for background
other conditions may apply.
Example: A beneficiary owns a novel technology needed by other beneficiaries for
implementing their tasks under the action and the other beneficiaries do not bring the same
level of background. In such case the beneficiaries may agree that access to the novel
technology to implement the action will not be on a royalty-free basis.
Best practice: If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is
recommended that this is explained in detail in their proposal. Royalty fees paid for
access to background for implementation purposes may exceptionally be eligible costs
if explicitly agreed by all beneficiaries before grant signature (see Article 6.2.C.3).
– for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions.
Scope of access:
Sublicensing/Licensing — Additional access rights — More favourable terms — Additional
conditions
The access rights set out in the Grant Agreement cover only the access needed.
Access rights are a right to use by the entity concerned and do NOT automatically give the
right to the requesting beneficiary to sub-licence. (If this were the case, access rights to
results would be extended — without consent — to virtually any entity in the world, including
a beneficiary’s competitors).
Sub-licensing is only allowed if the beneficiary owning the results agrees — although such
agreement should not be unduly refused, if the sublicensing is necessary. In this case the
sub-licensing does not have to be royalty-free (even if the access rights concerned would be)
and can itself be made subject to specific conditions.
Examples:
1. A university may need the right to sub-license access to results needed to exploit its own
results to third parties, to make it possible to derive value from its own results.
2. In large industrial groups it is quite common that research is conducted by one entity and
exploitation by one or several other entities. Access rights enjoyed by the ‘research entity’ but
not by the ‘exploitation entities)’ would raise problems for those entities not covered by the
access rights for entities under the same control.
Best practice: If needed, agree on the terms and conditions of the sub-licensing generally
and in writing (in the consortium agreement or separately).
Examples: In such an agreement, they could foresee that sub-licensing could apply to the
results (or part of them), but not to the background; sub-licensing could apply to (some of the)
entities forming part of the same group , but not to (some of the) other entities.
The beneficiaries remain free to grant licences (including quasi-exclusive licences) to their
own results, as long as they can guarantee that all their grant obligations are/will be
respected, including that all access rights can be exercised. They can even grant an exclusive
licence to exploit their results, if the other beneficiaries have waived any access rights which
would make granting the exclusive licence impossible (and no additional obligations apply
with the same effect, e.g. additional exploitation/access rights obligations).
Beneficiaries are free to grant additional access rights to results, beyond the rights foreseen
in the grant if compatible with their obligations under the grant.
378EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Examples: Additional access rights for third parties (e.g. affiliated entities if they need it for
implementation purposes, entities under same control but not established in an EU Member State
or HE associated country).
Best practice: Such additional provisions may be included in the consortium agreement or in
a separate agreement.
Access may also be granted on more favourable terms (e.g. include the right to sub-licence)
or be made subject to additional conditions (e.g. appropriate confidentiality obligations).
Access rights may be exercised as long as agreed by the concerned beneficiaries (e.g. which
for patents could be until the patent expires).
Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies
and national authorities to results for policy purposes — Horizon Europe actions:
The granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies (and/or EU Member States
national authorities for Horizon Europe actions under the cluster ‘Civil security for Society’)
have specific access rights for policy purposes. Such access does not extend to beneficiaries’
background.
Access rights for the granting authority, Euratom institutions, funding bodies and
the Joint Undertaking Fusion for Energy — Euratom actions:
In Euratom actions, the granting authority, Euratom institutions, Euratom funding bodies and
the Fusion for Energy Joint Undertaking have royalty-free access, for:
− developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and programmes
− complying with Euratom’s obligations under international research and cooperation
agreements in the field of nuclear energy.
These access rights include the right to sub-license (e.g. to third parties involved in such an
international agreement) or to use the results in public procurement, as long as they are only
used for non-commercial and non-competitive purposes.
Example: Euratom is part of the ITER Agreement and is committed to disseminating information
on technological solutions developed in the context of ITER projects, and to sharing them on a
non-discriminatory basis with other ITER members and ITER itself. It does this by giving ITER and
ITER members royalty-free licences, including the right to sub-license, for the intellectual
property produced, so that they can publicly sponsor fusion and research programmes.
Additional access rights:
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional access rights, they must
also be respected and access granted.
Example: Additional access rights for the beneficiaries of linked actions.

COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION, OPEN SCIENCE AND VISIBILITY (— ARTICLE 17)
(HE)
Dissemination
Dissemination of results
The beneficiaries must disseminate their results as soon as feasible,in a publicly available format,subject to
any restrictions due to the protection of intellectual property, security rules or legitimate interests.
A beneficiary that intends to disseminate its results must give at least 15 days advance notice to the other
beneficiaries (unless agreed otherwise), together with sufficient information on the results it will disseminate.
381EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Any other beneficiary may object within (unless agreed otherwise) 15 days of receiving notification, if it can
show that its legitimate interests in relation to the results or background would be significantly harmed. In
such cases, the results may not be disseminated unless appropriate steps are taken to safeguard those
interests.
Additional dissemination obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional dissemination obligations, the beneficiaries must alsocomply
with those.
Open Science
Open science: open access to scientific publications
The beneficiaries must ensure open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to their results. In
particular, they must ensure that:
- at the latest at the time of publication, a machine-readable electronic copy of the published version
or the final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication, is deposited in a trusted repository
for scientific publications
- immediate open access is provided to the deposited publication via the repository, under the latest
available version of the Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or a
licence with equivalent rights; for monographs and other long-text formats, the licence may exclude
commercial uses and derivative works (e.g. CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND) and
- information is given via the repository about any research output or any other tools and instruments
needed to validate the conclusions of the scientific publication.
Beneficiaries (or authors) must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with the open access
requirements.
Metadata of deposited publications must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain Dedication (CC
0) or equivalent, in line with the FAIR principles (in particular machine-actionable) and provide information
at least about the following: publication (author(s), title, date of publication, publication venue); Horizon
Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and number; licensing terms; persistent identifiers
for the publication, the authors involved in the action and, if possible, for their organisations and the grant.
Where applicable, the metadata must include persistent identifiers for any research output or any other tools
and instruments needed to validate the conclusions of the publication.
Only publication fees in full open access venues for scientific publications are eligible for reimbursement.
Open science: research data management
The beneficiaries must manage the digital research data generated in the action (‘data’) responsibly, in line
with the FAIR principles and by taking all of the following actions:
- establish adata management plan (‘DMP’) (and regularly update it)
- as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP, deposit the data in a trusted repository;
if required in the call conditions,this repository must be federated in the EOSC in compliance with EOSC
requirements
- as soon as possible and withinthe deadlines set out in the DMP, ensure open access — via the repository
— to the deposited data, under the latest available version of the Creative Commons Attribution
International Public License (CC BY) or Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0) or a
licence/dedication with equivalent rights, following the principle ‘as open as possible as closed as
necessary’, unless providing open access would in particular:
- be against the beneficiary’s legitimate interests, including regarding commercial exploitation,or
- be contrary to any other constraints, in particular the EU competitive interests or the
beneficiary’s obligations under this Agreement; if open access is not provided (to some or all
data), this must be justified in the DMP
382EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- provide information via therepository about any research output or any other tools and instruments
needed to re-use or validate the data.
Metadata of deposited data must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or
equivalent (to the extent legitimate interests or constraints are safeguarded), in line with the FAIR principles
(in particular machine-actionable) and provide information at least about the following: datasets (description,
date of deposit, author(s) and embargo); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym
and number; licensing terms; persistent identifiers for the dataset, the authors involved in the action, and, if
possible, for their organisations and the grant. Where applicable, the metadata must include persistent
identifiers for related publications and other research outputs.
Open science: additional practices
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding open science practices, the beneficiaries
must also comply with those.
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding the validation of scientific publications,the
beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access to data or other results needed for validation of the
conclusions of scientific publications, to the extent that their legitimate interests or constraints are
safeguarded (and unless they already provided (open) access at publication).
Where the call conditions impose additional open science obligations in case of a public emergency, the
beneficiaries must (ifrequested by the granting authority) immediately deposit any research output in a
trusted repository and provide open access to it under a CC BY licence, a Public Domain Dedication (CC 0)
or equivalent. As an exception, if the access would be against the beneficiaries’ legitimate interests, the
beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licenses —under fair and reasonable conditions —to legal entities that
need the research output to address the public emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the
resulting products and services at fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after
the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities
Unless excluded by the call conditions, the beneficiaries must provide and regularly update a plan for the
exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities.
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules for communication, dissemination and visibility (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules regarding communication and dissemination activities.
Most programmes use the standard set of additional rules concerning the communication and
dissemination plan and the additional communication activities. Some programmes (HE,
RFCS, DEP) use more customised provisions.
2. Communication and dissemination plan (some programmes)
Programmes that need more detailed information about the communication strategy followed
by the action, have a provision obliging the beneficiaries to provide their full communication
plan (— in addition to the key elements that already need to be part of each proposal/DoA
Annex 1).
383EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For more guidance and communication best practices, see Communicating about your EU-
funded project and the HE Social Media Guide.
3. Special logos (some programmes)
In principle, for 2021-2027, all programmes follow the corporate EU visual identity, meaning
that there are in principle no longer any programme-specific logos. There are however
exceptions for some programmes (e.g. CREA Media, LIFE, HUMA, UCPM). Also, Grant
Agreements of EU funding bodies (such as for instance the EU joint undertakings) will keep
using their own logos (in addition to the EU logo) and will require their use by the projects.
4. Limited communication and visibility to protect persons involved (some
programmes)
Some programmes (especially those active in conflicts and crises, like HUMA and RELEX), will
limit communication and visibility options in order to protect the persons working on the
ground. In these cases, the consortium may propose to the granting authority alternative
arrangement.
5. Dissemination (HE)
Unless it goes against their legitimate interests, the beneficiaries must — as soon as feasible,
but not before a decision on their possible protection — disseminate their results, i.e. make
them public.
Security obligations — Dissemination may be restricted/NOT possible for results that
are subject to security rules (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
Results that are disclosed too early (before the decision on their protection) may run the risk
of making protection impossible.
Example: If a result is disclosed (in writing (including by e-mail) or orally (e.g. at a conference)
before filing for patent protection — even to a single person who is not bound by secrecy or
confidentiality obligations (typically someone from an organisation outside the consortium) this
may invalidate a subsequent patent application.
NO dissemination at all may take place, if:
− the results in question need to be protected as a trade secret (i.e. confidential know-
how) or
− dissemination conflicts with any other obligations under the grant (e.g. personal data
protection, security obligations, etc).
The beneficiaries may choose the appropriate publicly available format for disseminating their
results.
Standard forms of dissemination:
▪ website
▪ presentation at a scientific conference, at an education and training event or other
events with stakeholders and potential users of the results
▪ peer-reviewed publication
The dissemination measures should be consistent with the plan for the exploitation and
dissemination of the results (see below) and proportionate to the impact expected from the
action.
384EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
When deciding on dissemination, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’
legitimate interests.
The beneficiary that intends to disseminate must give the other beneficiaries at least 15 days
advance notice (together with sufficient information on the intended dissemination) — unless
otherwise agreed.
Any other beneficiary may object to dissemination — unless otherwise agreed — within 15
days of receiving notification, if it can show that it would suffer significant harm (in relation to
its background or results). In this case, the results may not be disseminated — unless
appropriate steps are taken to safeguard the interests at stake.
Examples (significant harm): Disseminating the results would lead to disclosure of valuable
background held by another beneficiary as a trade secret or would make protecting another
beneficiary’s results more difficult. Appropriate steps could include: omitting certain data or
postponing dissemination until the results are protected.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should provide for arrangements (either in the consortium
agreement or in separate agreements) to ensure that decisions on dissemination take due
account of the interests of all beneficiaries concerned and yet allow for publication of results
without unreasonable delay. This may include a specific mechanism to resolve any disputes
as soon as possible.
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional dissemination obligations,
those obligations must also be complied with/fulfilled.
Example: Requirement to disseminate the results in a specific website.
6. Open science (HE)
‘Open science’ is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of
knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the research process.
The open science provisions in Horizon Europe contain a set of requirements and encouraged
practices that cover some of the most important aspects of open science. They concern
research outputs such as scientific publications and research data and additional open
science practices .
‘Research outputs’ are results to which online access can be given in the form of scientific
publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes, such as software,
algorithms, protocols, models, workflows and electronic notebooks.
6. Open science: Open access to scientific publications (HE)
Beneficiaries must ensure open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to
their results. This includes articles and long-text formats, such as monographs and other
types of books. Immediate open access is required i.e. at the same time as the first
publication, through a trusted repository using specific open licences.
‘Peer review’ is the assessment of manuscripts or publications by researchers with relevant
expertise.
An article is considered to be peer-reviewed when it has been scrutinized and approved by
expert researchers. The number of the positive assessments required is set by each
publishing venue.
Long-text formats — such as books/monographs and edited volumes — are considered to be
peer-reviewed if the manuscript (or a substantial part thereof) has been reviewed at least by
one independent expert external to the publisher or to the series scientific editor(s). PhD
theses and habitations for professorial degrees are considered peer-reviewed, if they are
385EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
formally published through a publisher. Book chapters are NOT considered long-text formats
but are treated similarly to articles.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open access to ALL publications, even
if they are not peer-reviewed.
How to provide open access:
Beneficiaries/authors may publish in the venue of their choice, either in a closed venue (i.e.
access to all content is restricted), an open access publishing venue or in a hybrid publishing
venue, provided that all their open access-related obligations as detailed in this section are
complied with.
‘Open access publishing venues’ are publishing venues whose entire scholarly content is
published in open access (e.g. open access journals, books, publishing platforms, repositories
or preprint servers).
‘Hybrid publishing venues’ are publishing venues which provide part of their scholarly content
in open access, while another part is accessible through subscriptions/payments (e.g. hybrid
journals and books). These are often journals/books based on subscription/purchase which
provide open access to part of their content when an open access fee is paid by their
authors/institutions (paid ad hoc or on the basis of an institutional agreement with the
publishers).
‘Mirror and sister journals’ (i.e. more recently established open access versions of existing
subscription journals, which may share the same editorial board as the original journal and
usually have (at least initially) the same or very similar aims, scope and peer review
processes and policies; these journals often have a name similar to the subscription title but
a different ISSN) are considered open access publishing venues for Horizon Europe grants
(not hybrid journals).
In parallel, beneficiaries/authors must deposit their publication in a machine-readable format
(i.e. structured format that can automatically be read and processed by a computer) in a
trusted repository — before or at publication time — and immediately provide open access to
the publication through that repository.
Publishing in an open access venue without depositing in a repository, does NOT comply
with the open access requirements. All peer-reviewed publications must be deposited in
trusted repositories and open access provided to them through the repositories.
When choosing the publishing venue and the repository, beneficiaries/authors must keep in
mind that licensing requirements, metadata requirements and validation requirements must
also be complied with at this time.
The European Commission offers Horizon Europe beneficiaries Open Research Europe
(ORE), an open access publishing platform with no publishing fees. ORE is offered as
an additional publishing option to Horizon Europe beneficiaries. When ORE is the selected
publishing venue, all requirements for open access to scientific publications are automatically
fulfilled, as ORE deposits publications in the all-purpose repository Zenodo under the
conditions required by Horizon Europe.
Immediate open access through the repository must be provided either to the final peer-
reviewed manuscript accepted for publication or to the final published peer-reviewed version.
Please also note that publication fees are only eligible when publishing in full open access
publishing venues (venues in which the entire scholarly content is openly accessible to all)
and not in hybrid venues. Publication fees may, in particular, include peer review fees,
including where the peer review service has been provided by an organisation different from
386EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
the one providing the publishing venue. Peer review fees for publications are eligible for
reimbursement only for the first round of peer reviewers.
Publishing fees (including page charges or colour charges) for publications in other
venues, for example in subscription journals (including hybrid journals) or in books that
contain some scholarly content that is open and some that is closed are NOT eligible costs.
Publishing fees for open access books may be eligible to the extent that they cover the
first digital open access edition of the book (which could include different formats such as
html, pdf, epub, etc).
Printing fees for monographs and other books are NOT eligible.
Repository requirements:
Beneficiaries must ensure deposition of and open access to publications (and research data,
where the case) through trusted repositories.
‘Repositories’ are online archives, where researchers can deposit digital research outputs and
provide (open) access to them.
Repositories help manage and provide access to scientific outputs and contribute to the long-
term preservation of digital assets.
They can be institutional, operating with the purpose to collect, disseminate and preserve
digital research outputs of individual research organisations (institutional repositories, e.g.
the repository of University X) or domain-specific, operating to support specific research
communities and supported/endorsed by them (e.g. Europe PMC for life sciences including
biomedicine and health or arXiv for physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative
biology, quantitative finance and statistics; Phonogrammarchiv for audio-visual recordings
the CLARIN-DK-UCPH Repository for digital language data or the European Nucleotide Archive
or databases of astronomical observations operated by the European Southern Observatory,
among others). There are also general-purpose repositories, such as for example Zenodo,
developed by CERN.
Personal websites and databases, publisher websites, as well as cloud storage services
(Dropbox, Google drive, etc) are NOT considered repositories. Academia.edu, ResearchGate
and similar platforms do not allow open access under the terms required and therefore are
also NOT considered repositories.
Trusted repositories can be grouped into three categories which may overlap:
− certified repositories, such as those certified by international organisations or
government-authorised certification bodies (e.g. CoreTrustSeal, nestor Seal
DIN31644, ISO16363)
− disciplinary or domain repositories commonly used and endorsed by the research
communities, and which are recognised internationally
− general-purpose repositories, institutional repositories or any other repositories that
present the essential characteristics of trusted repositories, i.e.:
− display specific characteristics of organisational, technical and procedural quality,
such as services, mechanisms and/or provisions that are intended to secure the
integrity and authenticity of their contents, thus facilitating their use and re-use
in the short- and long-term. Trusted repositories have specific provisions in place
and offer explicit information online about their policies, which define their
services (e.g. acquisition, access, security of content, long-term sustainability of
service including funding, etc)
387EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− provide broad, equitable and ideally open access to content free at the point of
use, as appropriate, and respect applicable legal and ethical limitations. They
assign persistent unique identifiers to contents (e.g. DOIs, handles, etc), such
that the contents (publications, data and other research outputs) are
unequivocally referenced and thus citeable. They ensure that contents are
accompanied by metadata sufficiently detailed and of sufficiently high quality to
enable discovery, reuse and citation and contain information about provenance
and licensing. Their metadata is machine-actionable and standardized (e.g.
Dublin Core, Data Cite, etc) preferably using common non-proprietary formats
and following the standards of the respective community the repository serves,
where applicable
− facilitate mid- and long-term preservation of the deposited material. They have
mechanisms or provisions for expert curation and quality assurance for the
accuracy and integrity of datasets and metadata, as well as procedures to liaise
with depositors where issues are detected. They meet generally accepted
international and national criteria for security to prevent unauthorized access
and release of content and have different levels of security, depending on the
sensitivity of the data being deposited, to maintain privacy and confidentiality.
Licensing requirements and IPR:
Scientific publications must be licensed under the latest available version of a Creative
Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or an equivalent licence. For
monographs and other long-text formats the licence may exclude commercial uses and
derivative works (as in CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND or CC BY-NC-ND or equivalent licences).
For more guidance, including an explanatory checklist of the rights conferred by the above
licences that will help researchers to understand publisher-equivalent licences, see the HE
Programme Guide.
Beneficiaries (or authors, where the case) must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to
be able to comply with their open access requirements.
The obligation to ensure open access under the conditions set out in the Grant Agreement
precedes any subsequent publishing agreement and is therefore a prior obligation with
respect to such agreements.
Best practice: Beneficiaries/authors retain the copyright on their work and grant, insofar as
possible, non-exclusive licences to publishers. To facilitate this, beneficiaries should put in
place institutional policies to ensure copyright retention by authors and/or beneficiaries and
compliance with the open access requirements.
To help you find publishing venues that comply with Horizon Europe open access
requirements, you can use:
- the Journal Checker Tool — can help to determine whether a specific publishing venue
allows compliance with the open access obligations of Horizon Europe
- the Directory of Open Access Journals — can help to identify full open access journals
that allow open access publishing under CC BY or an equivalent licence
- Open Research Europe — open access publishing platform of the European
Commission, allows automatic compliance with the Horizon Europe requirements.
Validation requirements:
Information must be given via the repository (or via the copy of the publication deposited in
the repository) about any research output or any other tools and instruments needed to
388EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
validate the conclusions of the scientific publication. Research outputs, tools and instruments
may include data, software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks
and others. Information should include a detailed description of the research
output/tool/instrument, how to access it, any dependencies on commercial products,
potential version/type, potential parameters, etc.
Best practice: It is recommended that open access is provided to these research outputs,
tools and instruments — unless legitimate interests or constraints apply.
Metadata requirements:
Metadata should be in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
principles. In particular, it should be machine-actionable (i.e. machine-readable, and
automatic computer processing can extract information from the metadata attributes
ensuring a cross-linking between different research outputs) and follow a standardised
format, in line with community standards, and should provide rich information on the
publication/data (author(s), publication title, date of publication, publication venue); Horizon
Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and number; licensing terms.
Additionally, metadata must be open access under a Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication (CC0) or equivalent, ensuring its reusability.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or a handle) must
be provided for the peer-reviewed version of the publication in the first publishing venue
(e.g. journal, book, publishing platform); where the peer-reviewed version has been
published in a preprint server or a repository as first publishing venue, the PID of that
version has to be provided. PIDs also have to be provided for all author(s) involved in the
action (such as ORCIDs or ResearcherIDs) and, if possible, for their organisations (such as
ROR IDs) and the grant (such as grant DOIs).
Best practice: It is recommended that researchers apply these requirements for metadata to
digital research outputs, including data and other tools and instruments identified as
necessary to validate publications.
Visibility, acknowledgment of EU support and disclaimers:
Scientific publications must also acknowledge the EU support and display the European flag
(emblem) and funding statement in line with the provisions set out in Article 17 and, where
applicable, the special logos set out in Annex 5 (see specific rules below).
Best practice: In addition to the metadata requirements, in order to facilitate the
identification of your action and follow-up by the granting authority and your
readers/audience, it is recommended to include, within the text of your publication, specific
information on the grant (e.g. project name, acronym, grant agreement number, and/or your
project's digital object identifier (project DOI)).
7. Open science: Research data management (HE)
Beneficiaries must manage responsibly the digital research data generated in the action
(‘data’) in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. They
should also ensure open access to research data via a trusted repository under the principle
‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.
Generated data also includes re-used data that have been processed or modified in a
systematic or methodical way.
The requirements for research data management apply only to data that are generated in the
course of the action. Beneficiaries should also consider re-used data when developing their
389EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
data management plans (DMPs), if they form part of their research and to the extent
possible.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to manage research outputs other than
publications and research data also in line with the FAIR principles and to adequately describe
relevant efforts in the DMP. Other research outputs may include software, algorithms, code,
protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks among others.
How to meet the research data management and open access requirements:
Beneficiaries must do the following to meet the requirements:
− establish a data management plan (DMP), addressing important aspects of research
data management
AND
− deposit the data in a trusted repository and ensure open access through the
repository, as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP.
Data management plan
Beneficiaries must submit a DMP as a mandatory project deliverable (normally within 6
months after grant signature). An updated DMP deliverable must then be produced mid-
project (for projects longer than twelve months) and at the end of the project (where
relevant).
The ‘data management plan (DMP)’ is a document that outlines from the start of the project
the main aspects of the lifecycle of research outputs, notably including data. This includes
their provenance, organisation and curation, as well as adequate provisions for their access,
preservation, sharing, and eventual deletion, both during and after a project.
Writing a DMP is an activity directly linked to the methodology of the research, i.e. good data
management will make the work more efficient/save time, contribute to safeguarding
information and to increasing the impact and the value of the data among the beneficiaries
and others, during and after the research.
Beneficiaries should maintain the DMP as a living document and update it over the course of
the project whenever significant changes arise. This includes (but is not limited to) the
generation of new data, changes in data access provisions or curation policies, attainment of
tasks (e.g. datasets deposited in a repository, etc), changes in relevant practices (e.g. new
innovation potential, decision to file for a patent), changes in consortium composition.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to encode their DMP deliverables as non-
restricted, public deliverables, unless there are reasons (legitimate interests or other
constraints) not to do so. In the case they are made public, it is also recommended that open
access is provided under a CC BY licence to allow a broad re-use.
For more guidance on research data management and making research data FAIR, and for a
DMP template, see the HE Programme Guide.
De posit and ensure open access through trusted repository
The data must be deposited in a trusted repository, ensuring open access via the repository,
as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP.
The deposition of the data must take place as soon as possible after data
production/generation or after adequate processing and quality control have taken place,
providing value and context to the data and at the latest by the end of the project.
390EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This does not entail that data must be made open, but rather that it is deposited so that
metadata information is available and hence information about the data is findable. In
exceptional cases in which specific constraints apply (e.g. security rules), deposition can be
delayed beyond the end of the project.
Best practice: It is recommended to maintain data available for a substantial period — at
least five years, and preferably 10 years or even longer — according to specific needs and/or
disciplinary deposition practices, in line with the recommendations of the European Code of
Conduct for Research Integrity.
The data includes raw data, to the extent technically feasible, but especially if it is crucial to
enable re-analysis, reproducibility and/or data re-use.
Data underpinning a scientific publication should be deposited at the latest at the time of
publication, and in line with standard community practices.
For calls with a condition relating to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), data must be
deposited in trusted repositories that are federated in the EOSC in compliance with the EOSC
requirements. A list of the services offered by EOSC, including for storage and processing of
research data, can be found on the EOSC Portal.
Open access is required as the default for research data under the principle ‘as open as
possible, as closed as necessary’. This means that, as an exception, beneficiaries may or
must keep certain data closed for justified reasons; they must explain in the DMP the
exception(s) under which they choose to (or must) restrict access to some (or all) of the
research data.
Acceptable exceptions are: if providing open access is against the beneficiary’s legitimate
interests, including regarding commercial exploitation; if it is contrary to any other
constraints, such as data protection rules, privacy, confidentiality, trade secrets, EU
competitive interests, security rules, intellectual property rights or would be against other
obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples (valid justification):
1. Data which is commercially valuable may be kept closed if making the data open would
undermine the exploitation of the data or other results (such as could endanger trade secrets) or
make IP protection of results more difficult.
2. Data protection/privacy rules may mean that certain (sensitive) personal data cannot be made
open.
3. Security rules may also require closed data. In projects relating to the strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the Union, data should to be kept closed if making the data open
would put in jeopardy those objectives.
Licensing requirements:
Research data in open access must be licensed under the latest available version of a
Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) requiring attribution of
authorship, or a licence providing equivalent rights, or under a Creative Commons Public
Domain Dedication (CC0) or equivalent (which waives any rights to the data). The latter may
be appropriate in particular for large datasets that can be more easily re-used without
restrictions, or in any other case if authors so desire. A Creative Commons Public Domain
Mark (PDM) or equivalent should be applied to raw research data, unless the data meet the
requirements to be protected by copyright/database right.
Requirements for the re-use and validation of data:
Information must be given via the repository about any research output or any other tools
and instruments needed for the re-use or validation of research data. Research outputs, tools
and instruments may include data, software, algorithms, code, protocols, models, workflows,
electronic notebooks and others. Information must include a detailed description of the
391EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
research output/tool/instrument, how to access it, any dependencies on commercial
products, potential version/type, potential parameters, etc.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open access to these research outputs,
tools and instruments — unless legitimate interests or constraints apply.
Metadata requirements:
Metadata should be in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
principles. In particular, it should be machine-actionable (i.e. machine-readable, and
automatic computer processing can extract information from the metadata attributes
ensuring a cross-linking between different research outputs) and follow a standardised
format, in line with community standards, and should provide rich information on the data
(author(s), dataset description, date of dataset deposit, dataset deposit venue and dataset
embargo (if any)); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and
number; licensing terms.
Additionally, metadata must be open access under a Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication (CC0) or equivalent, to the extent that legitimate interests are safeguarded and
constraints are taken into account.
In cases where data is closed but there are no compelling reasons that the related metadata
should not be findable and accessible, it is recommended that open access is provided to the
metadata of the data, with CC0 public domain dedication or equivalent, if possible, while the
dataset itself remains closed.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) must be provided for the dataset (such as a Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) or a handle), for all author(s) involved in the action (such as ORCIDs or
ResearcherIDs) and, if possible, for their organisations (such as ROR IDs) and the grant
(such as grant DOIs).
All the above provisions regarding research data management are also recommended for
research outputs other than scientific publications and research data.
Beneficiaries (or researchers, where the case) should retain sufficient intellectual property
rights to comply with the research data management requirements and to follow the research
output management recommendations.
8. Open science: Additional open science practices (HE)
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional obligations regarding open
science practices, those obligations must also be complied with.
Such open science practices can include, where relevant, early and open sharing of research
(for example, through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, or crowd-sourcing);
research output management (beyond publications and data); measures to ensure
reproducibility of research outputs; providing open access to research outputs beyond
publications and research data (for example software, models, algorithms, and workflows);
participation in open peer-review; and involving all relevant knowledge actors including
citizens, civil society and end users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as
citizen science).
Specific cases (open science):
Additional obligations regarding validation of scientific publications — If provided for
in the work programme/call conditions, beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access
to data or other results needed for the validation of the conclusions of scientific publications,
to the extent that their legitimate interests are safeguarded and constraints are taken into
account (for example through agreements with relevant confidentiality provisions) and unless
they already provided the (open) access at the time of publication.
392EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Additional obligations regarding open science in public emergencies — If the public
emergency provisions apply and can be activated on request of the granting authority (see
above for more explanations on additional exploitation obligations in case of public
emergencies), the requirement regarding immediate open access is extended beyond
publications, i.e. to any research outputs as follows:
− Beneficiaries must immediately deposit any research output in a repository and
provide open access to it under the latest version of a CC BY licence or having
released it via a Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or equivalent. Immediate means
that deposition of the research outputs must take place as soon as feasible, taking
into consideration the urgent nature of public emergencies and the care for the public
good.
− As an exception, if providing open access would be against their legitimate interests,
the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable
conditions — to legal entities that need the research output to address the public
emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and
services on fair and reasonable conditions. This obligation will apply for a period of
time specified in the request and up to four years after the end of the action. The
duration of this obligation and the fairness and reasonability of the licences will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the specific circumstances of the
public emergency, the context of each project and the nature of its results.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
In addition to the requirements regarding data management plans (DMPs) outlined above, in
the case of a public emergency for which the granting authority has activated the provision
by a request made at the stage of the work programme/call conditions, the beneficiaries
should provide a DMP preferably with the proposal or at the latest before grant signature.
The work programme/call conditions may provide for additional obligations in this regard.
For more guidance on open science practices and how to incorporate them in the action see the
HE Programme Guide.
9. Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication
activities
Unless the work programme/call conditions explicitly state otherwise, proposals must include
a first version of the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including
communication activities. A more detailed plan will then need to be provided as mandatory
project deliverable (normally within 6 months after grant signature).
The ‘plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities’
is a document that details the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that
will be carried out in the project to achieve the expected impact.
All measures described in the plan should be proportionate to the scale of the project, and
should contain concrete actions to be implemented. Where relevant (and in particular for HE
Innovation Actions), the measures should describe a plausible path to commercialise the
393EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
innovations. If exploitation is expected primarily in non-associated third countries, justify by
explaining how that exploitation is still in the EU interest.
This plan must be updated as required under the Grant Agreement (at least once before the
end of the project), in alignment with the project’s progress. Changes on the dissemination,
exploitation and communication activities can be introduced through the Portal Continuous
Reporting tool. The last version of the plan before the end of the project must include the
dissemination and exploitation activities that the beneficiaries plan to implement in a period
up to 4 years after the end the project.
During that period, beneficiaries must continue reporting on the progress of their activities
and on the project results through the Portal Continuous Reporting tool, which will remain
accessible.

1. Specific rules for carrying out the action (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules for carrying out the actions.
Some of these additional rules are standardised (i.e. based on a similar text, e.g. specific
rules for public procurement actions, specific rules for financial support to third parties
(FSTP), specific rules for blending operations, etc). Others are completely customised and
programme-specific (e.g. specific rules for humanitarian aid operations (HUMA), specific rules
for ESF actions (ESF), specific rules for information and promotion campaigns for agricultural
products (AGRIP)).

SPECIFIC RULES FOR CARRYING OUT THE ACTION (— ARTICLE 18)
Implementation in case of restrictions due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU
and its Member States
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security, the beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated
partners, [third parties giving in-kind contributions,] subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third
parties are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) —unless
otherwise agreed with the granting authority.The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation
with entities established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect
the strategic assets, interests, autonomy or securityof the EU and its Member States.
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules for the participation in case of restrictions due to strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States (restricted
calls) (HE)
Where the work programme/call conditions restrict participation due to strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security (so-called ‘restricted calls’), the beneficiaries must ensure
that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners,
subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) are established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or,
if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless
otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
If applicable (and unless the work programme/call conditions provide otherwise),
beneficiaries should provide the necessary justification why the involvement of such entities
is needed. Thus, if already known at the time of submission, the proposals must clearly
indicate that they will involve such entities, i.e. identify (if possible) the entities concerned
and justify why their involvement is needed.
The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation with entities established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or,
if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect
the strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States. This
includes but is not limited to cooperations that could negatively impact the protection and
exploitation of the results.
For more guidance on restricted calls, see Guidance on participation in EU calls with ownership
and control restrictions.

The specific rules for the recruitment and working conditions of researchers apply to all
Horizon Europe and RFCS actions.
2. Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for their Recruitment —
Recruitment, working conditions and career development — Rights for the
researchers (HE, RFCS)
According to these rules, the beneficiaries must take all measures to implement the principles
set out in the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for their
Recruitment55.
The Charter provides a framework for researchers’ activities and career management, and
includes obligations for researchers, employers and funders. The Code of Conduct provides
for transparency to the recruitment and selection process, ensuring the equal treatment of all
applicants. It includes obligations for employers and funders.
55 Commission Recommendation 2005/251/EC of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on
a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75/67 , 22.3.2005, p. 67).
397EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific
steps to address conflicts between their policies and practices and the principles set out in the
European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken and measures put in place (see Article 20).
The granting authority will verify compliance with this obligation, when monitoring the action
implementation and in case of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 25).
The beneficiaries must in particular implement the general principles and requirements from
that relate to recruitment, working conditions and career development.
List of principles (relating to recruitment):
▪ Recruitment
▪ Transparency
▪ Judging merit
▪ Selection
▪ Variations in the chronological order of CVs
▪ Recognition of mobility experience
▪ Recognition of qualifications
▪ Seniority
▪ Postdoctoral appointments
List of principles (relating to working conditions):
▪ Research freedom
▪ Accountability
▪ Non-discrimination
▪ Working conditions
▪ Research environment
▪ Funding and salaries (in particular, adequate social security)
▪ Stability and permanence of employment
▪ Gender balance
▪ Intellectual property rights
▪ Complaints/appeals and
▪ Participation in decision-making bodies.
List of principles (relating to career development):
▪ Career development
▪ Access to research training and continuous development (independently of the
researcher’s status)
398EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Value of mobility
▪ Access to career advice
▪ Supervision
▪ Evaluation/appraisal systems.
The principles relating to recruitments imply that beneficiaries should have a clear policy for
recruiting and selecting researchers, which is publicly available and ensures that:
− all research vacancies and funding opportunities are publicly advertised (e.g. via the
EURAXESS Jobs Portal56)
− vacancies and funding opportunities are also published in English
− vacancy announcements include a clear job description
− vacancy announcements include the requirements for the position or the funding
opportunity, and the selection criteria
− there is an appropriate time period left between publication and the deadline for
applications
− there are clear rules for the composition of the selection panels (e.g. number and role
of members, inclusion of experts from other (foreign) institutions, gender balance)
− adequate feedback is given to applicants
− there is a complaint mechanism
− the selection criteria adequately value mobility, qualifications and experience,
including qualifications and experience obtained in non-standard or informal ways.
These principles also apply to selection procedures that do not lead to formal employment
relationship (e.g. award of a research fellowship).

Specific rules for access to research infrastructure (HE)
[OPTION for all HE and Euratom ToA (except HE IA, HE PCP/PPI, HE ERC Grants, HE EIC Grants and
HE EIT KIC Actions): Specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities
Definitions
Research Infrastructures —Facilities that provide resources andservices for the research communities to
conduct research and foster innovation in their fields. This definition includes the associated
human resources, and it covers major equipment or sets of instruments; knowledge-related
facilities such as collections, archives or scientific data infrastructures; computing systems,
communication networks, and any other infrastructure, of a unique nature and open to
external users, essential to achieve excellence in research and innovation. Where relevant,
they may be used beyond research, for example for education or public services, and they
may be ‘single-sited’, ‘virtual’ or ‘distributed’61:
When implementing access to research infrastructure activities, the beneficiaries must respect the following
conditions:
- for transnational access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, transnational access to research infrastructure or
installations for selected user-groups.
The access must include the logistical, technological and scientific support and the specific
training that is usually provided to external researchers using the infrastructure.
Transnational access can be either in person (hands-on), provided to selected users that visit
the installation to make use of it, or remote, through the provision to selected user-groups of
remote scientific services (e.g. provision of reference materials or samples, remote access to
a high-performance computing facility).
- categories of users that may have access:
Transnational access must be provided to selected user-groups, i.e. teams of one or more
researchers (users).
The majority of the users must work in a country other than the country(ies) where the
installation is located (unless access is provided by an international organisation, the Joint
Research Centre (JRC), an ERIC or similar legal entity).
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they have generated under the
action may benefit from the access (unless the users are working for SMEs).
Access for user groups with a majority ofusers not working in a EU Member State or
Horizon Europe associated countryis limited to 20% of the total amount of units of access
provided under the grant (unless a higher percentage is foreseen in Annex 1).
- procedure and criteria for selecting user groups:
The user groups must request access by submitting (in writing) a description of the work
that they wish to carry out and the names, nationalities and home institutions of the users.
The user groups must be selected by (one or more) selection panels set up by the
consortium.
The selection panels must be composed of international experts in the field, at least half of
them independent from the consortium (unless otherwise specified in Annex 1).
The selection panels must assess all proposals received and recommend a short-list of the
user groups that should benefit from access.
The selection panels must base their selection on scientific merit, taking into account that
priority should be given to user groups composed of users who:
61 See Article 2(1) of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme Regulation 2021/695.
400EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- have not previously used the installation and
- are working in countries where no equivalent research infrastructure exist.
It will apply the principles of transparency, fairness and impartiality.
Where the call conditions impose additional rules for the selection of user groups,the
beneficiaries must also comply with those.
- other conditions:
The beneficiaries must request written approval from the granting authority for the selection
of user groups requiring visits to the installations exceeding 3 months (unless such visits are
foreseen in Annex 1).
In addition, the beneficiaries must:
- advertise widely, including on a their websites, the access offered under the Agreement
- promote equal opportunities in advertising the access and take into account the gender
dimension when defining the support provided to users
- ensure that users comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement
- ensure that its obligations under Articles 12, 13, 17 and 33 also apply to the users
- keep records of the names, nationalities, and home institutions of users, as well as the
nature and quantity of access provided to them
- for virtual access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, virtual access to research infrastructure or installations.
‘Virtual access’ means open and free access through communication networks to digital
resources and services needed for research, without selecting the users to whom access is
provided.
The access must include the support that is usually provided to external users.
Where allowed by the call conditions, beneficiaries may in justified cases define objective
eligibility criteria (e.g. affiliation to a research or academic institution) for specific users.
- other conditions:
The beneficiaries must have the virtual access services assessed periodically by a board
composed of international experts in the field, at least half of whom must be independent from
the consortium (unless otherwise specified in Annex 1). For this purpose, information and
statistics on the users and the nature and quantity of the access provided, must be made
available to the board.
The beneficiaries must advertise widely, including on a dedicated website, the access offered
under the grant and the eligibility criteria, if any.
Where the call conditions impose additional traceability62 obligations, information on the
traceability of the users and the nature and quantity of access must be provided by the
beneficiaries.
These obligations apply regardless of the form of funding or budget categories used to declare the costs (unit
costs or actual costs or a combination of the two).]
62 According to the definition given in ISO 9000, i.e.: “Traceability is the ability to trace the history, application, use and
location of an item or its characteristics through recorded identification data.”The users can be traced, for example, by
authentication and/or by authorization or by other means that allows for analysis of the type of users and the nature and quantity
of access provided.
401EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities (HE)
The specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities apply to Horizon Europe
actions involving transnational and/or virtual access to research infrastructure for scientific
communities (in particular calls under Part III of the HE Work Programme, ‘Research
infrastructures’).
The specific rules in Annex 5 apply independently of the cost form chosen by the
beneficiary (unit cost or actual cost; see Article 6.2.D.3 and 6.2.D.4).
2. Transnational access to research infrastructure (HE)
Grants including this type of activity usually reimburse — for the provision of transnational
access — the following types of costs:
− ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the research infrastructure or installation and
costs related to logistical, technological and scientific support for users, including ad-
hoc user training and the preparatory and closing activities needed to use the
installation)
− ‘users’ travel and subsistence costs
− costs of advertising the transnational access offered under the action
− costs related to the selection procedure (e.g. the selection panel members’ travel and
subsistence costs, logistical costs of meetings, fees, etc.)
− costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the
periodic technical reports. For this purpose, beneficiaries should keep records of the
names, nationalities and home institutions of users, as well as the nature and quantity
of access provided to them.
‘Installation’ means a part or a service of a research infrastructure that could be used
independently from the rest. A research infrastructure consists of one or more installations.
The access costs (first indent) may be declared as unit costs, actual costs or — under certain
conditions — as a combination of the two (see HE RI authorising decision57), while the other
costs in this list (users’ travel and subsistence, advertisement, selection, reporting, etc) must
be declared as actual costs (see Article 6).
If the access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget
category 6.2.D.3 Transnational access to research infrastructure unit costs. They must fulfil
the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for that budget category (see
Article 6.2.D.3).
If they are declared as actual costs, they must be declared under the other budget categories
(see Article 6). They must fulfil the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for
57 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
402EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
the type of cost in question (e.g. costs for other goods and services must also fulfil the
specific eligibility conditions for the cost category C.3 Other goods, works and services).
Capital investments (i.e. equipment costs for renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable
equipment, infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed , unless provided for in the
work programme/call conditions (see also Article 6.2.D.3).
Transnational access must be measured (in ‘units of access’).
The units of access for the various installations must be specified in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. A unit of access will always be specified for each installation (regardless whether
the access costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs).
Examples (units of access): Per beam-hour for a synchrotron; per night for a telescope; per
number of frozen embryos for a mouse repository; per week of access for a historical archive; per
campaign-day for a research vessel.
Detailed information on the provision of access activity must be described in the periodic
technical reports.
Record-keeping — The beneficiaries must keep appropriate records and supporting
documentation to justify the number of units of transnational access for which they declare costs,
including:
− users’ names, nationalities and home institutions
− the nature and quantity of access and provided to them
− the number of units of access provided.
This information must be included in the periodic reports to the granting authority.
3. Transnational access which must be provided (HE)
Transnational access can be either:
− in person (hands-on), provided to selected users that visit the installation or
− remote, through the provision to selected users of remote scientific services.
Remote transnational access requires competitive selection of the users to be served under
the Grant Agreement, since it always applies to resources that are not unlimited (e.g.
computing hours on a supercomputer or remote analysis of a sample). It is thus different
from virtual access, for which selection of users is NOT required.
Examples (remote access): provision of reference materials or samples (e.g. shipping of a virus
strain); performing a remote sample analysis or sample deposition; remote access to a high-
performance computing facility.
Transnational access must be given to selected user groups (free of charge).
4. Categories of users that may have transnational access — Limited access for
special user groups (HE)
For transnational access, the majority of the users, in a user team applying for access, must
work in a country other than the country(ies) where the installation is located (— unless
access is provided by an international organisation, the European Commission Joint Research
Centre (JRC), a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) or similar legal entity
with international membership).
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they will generate under the
action may benefit from the access (— unless the users are working for SMEs).
403EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
User groups in which all or most users work in non-associated third countries may ONLY
have access for up to 20 % of the total number of units of access provided under the grant.
The consortium should itself define whether this 20% limit is uniformly applied to the
different installations or some installations may be used more than others. This should be
done in the consortium agreement.
Specific cases (transnational access to research infrastructure):
Distributed research infrastructure — In the case of distributed research infrastructures,
the exemption for the user origin/location applies to ALL installations providing services under
the umbrella of the research infrastructure (e.g. the ERIC), even if owned/operated by a
different legal entity (e.g. local/national node of an ERIC). In this case, all concerned
installations must be clearly listed in the proposal as being part of the same research
infrastructure benefitting from the exemption (e.g. the ERIC) and the distributed research
infrastructure (e.g. ERIC) must be a beneficiary. Beneficiaries must keep evidence that the
access to these installations or to their services are part of the offer of the distributed
infrastructure (e.g. service level agreements, other agreements).
With regard to related installations operated by another legal entity (e.g. local/national node
of an ERIC), this legal entity participate as:
- an affiliated entity to the research infrastructure
- another beneficiary if also carrying out other tasks in the project not under the
umbrella of the research infrastructure
- a third party to which the research infrastructure is purchasing access services
excluding any profit margin (see Article 6.2.C)
- a third party providing in-kind contributions free of charge
depending on the statutes of the research infrastructure, the agreements with its
nodes, the expected level of use of the concerned installations and any other relevant
implementation aspects.
5. Selection procedure with a selection panel (transnational access) (HE)
For transnational access, access providers must set up a common selection panel that
regularly evaluates the applications for access and recommends a shortlist of the user groups
that will benefit from access.
If justified, access providers may use several different selection sub-panels.
Example: Different thematic selection sub-panels could be set up for a set of analytical facilities
serving multidisciplinary communities.
6. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to users — Controls,
impact evaluation (transnational access) (HE)
The beneficiaries must ensure that users comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant
Agreement.
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are respected by the
users (e.g. through the agreement for the use of the research infrastructure, i.e. Terms and
conditions for use).
They cover in particular the obligations regarding controls and assessment. Thus, the
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA)
and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits
404EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
and investigations on the users (see Article 25), and in particular to audit proper
implementation of action tasks. If access is denied by the user, the costs will be rejected.
They must also ensure that the granting authority has the right to make an evaluation of the
impact of the action under Article 26.
7. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to users — Conflicts of
interest, confidentiality, visibility, liability (transnational access) (HE)
For transnational access, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the users comply with
certain other obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Obligations that must be extended to users:
▪ Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13)
▪ Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17)
▪ Liability for damages (see Article 33).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
users.
8. Virtual access to research infrastructure (HE)
Virtual access applies to digital resources and services needed for research that are available
through communication networks.
Grants including this type of activity usually reimburse — for the provision of virtual access—
the following types of costs:
− ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the installation during the course of the
action and costs related to technological and scientific support for users access (e.g. a
helpdesk)
− costs of advertising virtual access offered under the action
− costs related to the assessment carried out by the board of international experts (e.g.
costs of organising a board meeting)
− costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the
periodic technical reports and the assessment report (see below point 3).
The access costs (first indent) may be declared as unit costs, actual costs or — under certain
conditions — as a combination of the two (see HE RI authorising decision58), while the other
costs in this list (users’ travel and subsistence, advertisement, selection, reporting, etc) must
be declared as actual costs (see Article 6).
If the access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget
category 6.2.D.4 Virtual access to research infrastructure unit costs. They must fulfil the
general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for that budget category (see Article
6.2.D.4).
58 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
405EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If they are declared as actual costs, they must be declared under the other budget categories
(see Article 6). They must fulfil the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for
the type of cost in question (e.g. costs for other goods and services must also fulfil the
specific eligibility conditions for the cost category C.3 Other goods, works and services).
Capital investments (i.e. costs of renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable equipment,
infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed, unless provided for in the work
programme/call conditions (see also Article 6.2.D.4). In this case only the portion used to
provide virtual access under the project is eligible.
Virtual access must be measured (in ‘units of access’).
The units of access for the various installations be specified in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. A unit of access will always be specified for each installation (regardless whether
the access costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs).
When allowed by the call conditions and in well justified cases, the grant proposal can also
define objective eligibility criteria (e.g. affiliation to a research or academic institution) for the
users to whom access will be provided under the grant.
Detailed information on the provision of access activity must be described in the periodic
technical reports, including statistics on all users in the reporting period compiled through
web analytical tools.
9. Virtual access which must be provided (HE)
Since virtual access applies to digital resources and services available through communication
networks (i.e. resources that are unlimited available), the users do NOT have to undergo a
formalised selection procedure (this, together with the transnationality of users, is the main
difference between virtual and transnational access).
Access provided must be free of charge for users.
Example: Access to a database available on the internet.
10. Periodic assessment by a board of international experts (virtual access) (HE)
For virtual access, the access services must be regularly assessed by a board of international
experts, at least half of whom must be independent from the consortium (unless otherwise
specified in Annex 1).
At least two assessments are usually carried out during the course of an action.
The assessment reports must already be foreseen in the proposal (as deliverables; see HE RI
application form) and be included in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement.
406EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Annex 5 > HE PCP and PPI procurements
Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements (HE)
[OPTION for HE PCP-PPI: Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements
When implementing procurements in Pre-commercial Procurement (PCP) or Public Procurement of Innovative
Solution (PPI) actions,the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination,
equal treatment, sound financial management,proportionality and competition rules
- assign the ownership of the intellectual property rights under the contracts to the contractors (for PPI
procurements: unless there are exceptional overriding public interests which are duly justified in
Annex 1), with the right of the buyers to access results —on a royalty-free basis—for their own use
and to grant (or to require the contractors to grant) non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the
results for them —under fair and reasonable conditions —without any right to sub-license
- allow for all communications to be made in English (and any additional languages chosen by the
beneficiaries)
- ensure that prior information notices, contract notices and contract award notices contain information
on the EU funding and a disclaimer that the EU is not participating as contracting authority in the
procurement
- allow for the award of multiple procurement contracts within the same procedure (multiple sourcing)
- for procurements involving classified information: apply the security rules set outin Annex 5 mutatis
mutandis to the contractors and the background and results of the contracts
- where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons: apply the restrictions set out in Annex 5 mutatis mutandis to the contractors and the
results under the contracts
- where the call conditions impose a place of performance obligation: ensure that the part of the
activities that is subject to the place of performance obligation is performed in the eligible countries or
target countries set out in the call conditions
- to ensure reciprocal level of market access: where the WTO Government Procurement Agreement
(GPA) does not apply, ensure that the participation in tendering procedures is open onequal terms to
bidders from EU Member States and all countries with which the EU has an agreement in the field of
public procurement under the conditions laid down in that agreement, including all Horizon Europe
associated countries. Where the WTO GPA applies, ensure that tendering procedures are also open to
bidders from states that have ratified this agreement, under the conditions laid down therein. ]
1. Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements (HE)
These specific provisions apply to HE PCP and PPI types of action (i.e. calls with PCP/PPI
ToA).
They summarise the key requirements from General Annex H of the HE Work Programme for
the beneficiaries that are part of the buyers group (procurers).
407EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Formally speaking, the Annex 5 provisions apply ONLY for calls that run as PCP/PPI type
of action (i.e. where also the specific cost category in Article 6.2.D.5 applies).
Other types of calls (RIA, IA, CSA, etc) are NOT subject to Annex 5 (nor to Article
6.2.D.5) —even if projects should include PCP or PPI activities. For them, the PCP/PPI
activities must be handled as subcontracting in accordance with Article 6.2.B and Article
9.3.
However, for BOTH groups, the detailed provisions in General Annex H of the HE Work
Programme apply. If you plan to implement PCP or PPI activities in a Horizon Europe action,
you should therefore always first look at the General Annex.
2. Conflict of interest (HE)
The beneficiaries must avoid potential conflicts of interest in the preparation and
implementation of PCP/PPI procurements.
‘Conflict of interests’ means any situation where the impartial and objective implementation
of the Agreement could be compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life, political
or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect interest (see Article 12).
Therefore, entities that could have a potential conflict of interest with the PCP/PPI
procurement should in principle NOT be involved in the EU grant.
Thus, for instance potential providers of solutions can NOT participate as beneficiaries,
affiliated entities or associated partners in the EU grant. They can also NOT be used as
external experts, consultants or subcontractors for tasks to help prepare and/or manage the
PCP/PPI procurement (e.g. tasks for preparing the open market consultation and/or tender
specifications, evaluation of tenders, management of the procurement procedure).
Entities that are not potential providers, but which represent such providers (e.g. industry /
research associations or funding agencies, standardisation fora / bodies) can participate but
must take specific measures to ensure avoidance of conflict of interest. They must, for
instance, ensure that:
− the activities are performed in an impartial, independent way by their own staff (not
by staff of the providers)
− any interactions with providers are done in a non-discriminatory way (ensuring equal
treatment of ‘all’ providers, without giving any preferential treatment to those
providers that are represented by the entity).
3. Transparency — Communications in English — Equal treatment and non-
discrimination of tenderers and providers (HE)
The beneficiaries must comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and
equal treatment.
The transparency requirements apply both before, during and after the end of the PCP/PPI
procurement. They aim to ensure that all potentially interested providers are informed well
in advance to be able to make an offer and to disseminate the results of the PCP/PPI
procurement in line with the Horizon Europe policy on dissemination.
The public procurers must, in particular:
− publish prior information notices for the open market consultation (PINs), contract
notices and contract award notices in the OJEU (TED)
408EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− at the end of the PCP/PPI tender evaluation (for PCP, also for each phase) provide to
the granting authority:
− information on the total number of bids received, winning tenderer(s) and
abstracts of their project(s) (template) — public deliverable; will be published by
the granting authority
− final ranking list of the selected projects, final scores and qualitative assessment
per criterion for each bid received, minutes of the evaluation meeting — non-
public deliverable
− at the end of the action:
− give a demonstration to the granting authority of the tested solutions (PCP),
respectively the deployed innovative solution(s) (PPI)
− assessment by the procurers of the results achieved by each tenderer (for PCPs,
also after each phase) (template) — public deliverable; will be published by the
granting authority
Additional requirements for the PINs, contract notice and contract award notices (including
timing and exceptions) are set out in the General Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
Regarding deadlines for publication of notices, we will consider as the ‘date of publication’ the
date when you submitted the notice to the OJEU Publication Office.
In order to foster wide participation of potential providers from across Europe, the
procurement procedure must be done at least in English. In addition to English, you can also
choose to allow other languages.
This obligation applies not only to the language(s) used by the public procurers for
publication of the PINs, contract notice and contract award notice, the tender specifications
and contracts, but also to the language(s) that tenderers are allowed to use for the
submission of questions and offers.
Additional transparency requirements (including timing and exceptions) are set out in General
Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
The beneficiaries must ensure non-discrimination and equal treatment of all tenderers,
throughout the preparation and implementation of the procurement.
They must pay particular attention to:
− keep market consultations open to all tenderers
− evaluate all offers according to the same objective criteria, regardless of the
geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of the tenderers
It is therefore NOT possible to restrict the access or give preferential access to:
− tenderers from your specific country, region or city
− startups or SME type solution providers
− tenderers with a specific governance structure (e.g. stock listed vs non-stocklisted
companies, foundations, NGOs, research organisations, etc).
− not to provide information in a discriminatory manner that may give some
tenderers/providers an advantage over others
409EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− not to reveal confidential information communicated by a tenderer/provider without
their explicit agreement.
This can be ensured by including appropriate provisions for communication and
confidentiality of information in the open market consultation and call for tender
documents.
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
4. Intellectual property rights (HE)
Results generated by the beneficiaries follow the standard rules on IPR in Article 16 and
Annex 5.
For results generated by PCP/PPI procurement providers, the ownership of the IPR must
be assigned to the providers (for PPI procurements: unless there are exceptional overriding
public interests which are duly justified in the DoA Annex 1).
For PCP procurements, the beneficiaries must reserve the rights to:
− enjoy royalty-free access rights to the R&D results for their own use
− grant themselves (or to require the providers to grant) non-exclusive licences to third
parties, to exploit the results for them under fair and reasonable market conditions,
without any right to sub-license
This right serves as a safeguard to ensure continuity of service and a competitive
supply chain (during or after the action). It does NOT mean that every PCP provider
will always and automatically be obliged to grant licences to third parties to exploit the
results.
Example (licences needed): Other providers working for the procurers need access to the
IPR to work for the procurers. A PCP provider abuses its monopoly situation in the
commercialisation of products resulting from the PCP and, in order to ensure a competitive
supply chain, the procurers need another provider on the market to be able to supply them the
products.
The right is only allocated to the procurers (not to third parties directly) and only
applies to cases when licensing to third parties is needed to exploit the results ‘for the
procurers’ (not for other potential customers). Therefore, the provision does NOT give
competitors of the PCP providers any rights to require the procurers and/or PCP
providers to grant them licences to exploit the results. The provision also does NOT
give the procurers any rights to grant (or require the PCP providers to grant) licences
to third parties to exploit the results for ‘other markets’ beyond the procurers. The
licensing must ensure also that the PCP provider is financially compensated under fair
and reasonable market conditions.
− require the provider to transfer ownership of the results to them, if the provider uses
the results to the detriment of the public interest (including security interests) or fails
to commercially exploit the results within a given period after the PCP as fixed in the
PCP contract (call back provision)
This right serves as a safeguard to prevent abuse of results and ensure commercial
exploitation of results in the public interest, in case the PCP providers fail to do so
themselves. It can be exercised after consultation with the PCP on the reasons for why
this happened. By obtaining the IPR ownership, the public procurers can ensure
410EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
commercial exploitation of the results in line with the public interest. It will be for
exceptional cases.
Example (call-back needed): A PCP provider is winding up its business or decides to stop the
production line that commercialises the PCP results. A PCP provider abuses security related
results, for example to hack public services.
− to publish public summaries of the results of the PCP procurement, including
information about key R&D results attained and lessons learnt (e.g. on the feasibility
of the solution approaches to meet the requirements and lessons learnt for potential
future deployment of solutions).
Details that would be contrary to the public interest, would harm legitimate business
interests (e.g. regarding IPR-protected specificities of their individual approaches to
solutions) or could distort fair competition may not be disclosed.
To see what is normally published, see the templates for PCP-PPI Contractor details
and abstracts and End of phase and end of project results and conclusions for PCP-
PPI.
This allows to optimise the conditions for the PCP providers to pursue wide exploitation of
results and for the procurers to use the results without supplier lock-in, while ensuring that
the PCP procurement complies with the conditions for its exemption from the EU Public
Procurement Directives and from the international procurement agreements between the EU
and third countries.
If additional exploitation obligations apply, the beneficiaries must moreover ensure that the
PCP/PPI procurement call for tender documents comply with these obligations.
Example:
1. Due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions may require
that PCP/PPI providers commercialise the majority of the results in EU Member States.
2. Due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions may restrict
the participation to the action to entities that are established in (and controlled from) EU Member
States. Annex 5, stipulates that in the case, the beneficiaries (in particular the procurers carrying out
the PCP/PPI) as well as the PCP/PPI providers may NOT transfer ownership of their results or grant
licences to third parties which are not established (and, if applicable, are not controlled from) EU
Member States — unless they have requested and received prior approval by the granting authority.
Finally, for all PCP/PPI procurements, the allocation of the IPR to the providers must be
factored into the tender price. This will allow to obtain the best value for money price
according to market conditions (and rule out State aid).
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
5. Multiple sourcing (HE)
For PCP procurements, the use of multiple sourcing is obligatory, because pre-commercial
is per definition a procurement approach that awards multiple procurement contracts for R&D
services to multiple tenderers within the same procedure, in order to compare and test
potential alternative solution approaches from different providers in parallel.
For PPI procurements, the use of multiple sourcing is optional, unless the call conditions
explicitly require it. Although multiple sourcing requires higher upfront investment from the
buyers in terms of procurement budget and effort needed to monitor the contracts, multiple
sourcing can be useful for the deployment of solutions in PPIs for a number of reasons:
411EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− security reasons: multiple sourcing can be needed to guarantee the required security
levels and assurances in the supply of goods or services
− security of supply: multiple sourcing removes the dependency on only one supplier to
deliver all solutions and can guarantee that there is at all times security of supply of
sufficient solutions. This may be vital where a steady, reliable supply of
products/services is needed but the supply chain is fragile and the risk is too big to
rely on one supplier only to deliver all required solutions (e.g. supply of COVID
vaccines)
− strategic autonomy: multiple sourcing can reduce the dependency on non-European
providers for example by awarding the same contracts to both European and non-
European providers. This can be vital in situations of geopolitical tensions or
uncertainty
− continuity of service: solution/technology redundancy guarantees that if one solution
of one provider crashes/fails, another can immediately take over
Example: Since so many public services run these days on digital networks, ICT networks
typically install nodes from different competing providers and load balancing ensures that if
there is a technical failure in nodes from one provider, nodes from other providers that are
implemented differently can immediately take over the task and there is no service disruption.
− complementarity of solutions: when none of the solutions of different providers works
on its own in all circumstances, and the simultaneous deployment of different
solutions from different providers is needed to cover all the possible situations that
may occur
Example: If a harbour wants to track goods across the full supply route, solutions based on
sensors, camera’s, optical scanners, satellite images can all detect movement of goods in
different situations, but none of them covers all situations (indoor versus outdoor, short versus
long range, high versus low accuracy). If there is no provider on the market with and end-to-
end solution that can address all situations and requirements, the best way forward may be to
buy and install simultaneously different solutions that use alternative technologies from
different providers.
− better value for money: by awarding the same contract to multiple providers, the level
of competition is maximised. If the performance of one of the providers drops
significantly, the public buyer will immediately notice and there is no hurdle for him to
switch immediately to one of the other providers. If the performance of one provider
significantly increases, the buyer can immediately ask the other providers why they
are not performing at the same level. This competition can incentivize providers to
continue to improve their level of performance and reduce their prices over time in
order to remain among the best of the pack.
6. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to providers — Security
related obligations (HE)
Actions that involve security issues must apply the security rules set out in Annex 5 mutatis
mutandis to the PCP/PPI procurement providers, the background and results of the
PCP/PPI contracts.
These security rules will impact the preparation and implementation of the PCP/PPI. The
procurers must ensure that the whole process (market consultation, preparation of the tender
documents, evaluation of tenders, award and performance of the contracts) respects the
security rules.
For PCP/PPIs involving classified information, the beneficiaries need to ensure that
throughout the whole process all involved staff on the side of the participating providers,
subcontractors and procurers and other involved beneficiaries have the required security
412EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
clearances, and that all communications and deliverables are submitted and handled
according to the applicable rules for handling classified information.
In addition, the security rules may impact the procurement procedures in terms of limiting
the information that be disclosed (both in terms of IPR, deliverables of the procurement,
dissemination activities), limiting the providers that can participate (both to the market
consultation and the call for tenders) and limiting the allowed subcontracting. All these
aspects require also prior written explicit approval of the EU granting authority.
PCPs/PPIs involving dual-use goods or dangerous materials and substances must comply with
applicable EU, national and international law on handling these items, and the procurers must
ensure that PCP/PPI providers deliver them the required export or transfer licences.
In case the Grant Agreement includes security recommendations that affect the PCP/PPI
procurement, the beneficiaries must ensure that the open market consultation and tender
documents comply with the recommendation.
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
7. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to providers — Restrictions
on participation and/or control (HE)
If, due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions restrict
the participation to beneficiaries that are established in (and controlled from) eligible
countries, for example EU Member States only, , only procurers established in (and controlled
from) EU Member States are allowed to carry out the PCP/PPI procurement. Procurers
established in (and controlled from) third countries are NOT allowed to participate in the
action.
For such calls, the beneficiaries must apply the restrictions also to the contractors. For this,
the procurers must ensure that the PCP/PPI call for tender documents restrict participation to
bidders/providers established in the eligible countries. Other bidders/providers cannot
participate.
Example: Due to security reasons, the call conditions may require that the participation to the PPI
grants under the call is restricted to procurers from EU Member States (e.g. because the call
concerns solutions with potentially security sensitive products/solutions. The buyers group must
then incorporate provisions in its PPI call for tender documents that ensure that for the lots of the
PPI procurement that are concerned (i.e. involve the deployment of security sensitive
products/solution components), the participation is limited to bidders/providers that are
established in and controlled from EU Member States. For lots that are not concerned (i.e. do not
involve the deployment of security sensitive products/solution components), the participation
should remain open to providers from all countries with which the EU has an international
agreement on public procurement under the conditions provided by that agreement.
8. Place of performance obligation (HE)
Where the call conditions impose a place of performance obligation, the beneficiaries must
ensure that the part of the PCP/PPI procurement activities that is subject to the place of
performance obligation is performed (by the providers and their subcontractors) in the
eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions
413EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For PCP, a more general minimum condition regarding place of performance is also
set out in the General Annex H of the HE Work Programme, i.e. that the majority (i.e. at
least 50%) of the activities performed for the PCP contract as well as the principle R&D
staff must be located in EU Member States or HE associated countries.
The ‘activities performed for the PCP contract’ include R&D and operational activities (e.g.
research, development, testing, certifying solutions, etc).
The ‘principal R&D staff’ are the main researchers, developers and testers responsible for
leading the R&D activities covered by the contract.
For PPI, the minimum condition doesn’t apply since PPI procurements are typically
subject to the WTO GPA and other international procurement agreements.
Example (PCP): For projects in the field of security, the call conditions may specific for example
that 100% of the R&D work performed for the PCP contract on security components of the solution
as well as all the principle R&D staff working on security components must be located in the EU
Member States. The EU Member States are then the target countries for this additional place of
performance obligation. The procurers in the action must then ensure that their PCP call for tender
documents include not only the minimum place of performance obligation but also include the above
additional place of performance obligation. This will ensure that PCP providers and their
subcontractors implement minimum 50 % of all activities — including the non-security activities — of
the PCP in the EU Member States and HE associated countries and 100% of the R&D work for the
security components of the solution in the EU Member States.
Example (PPI): For projects in the field of security, the call conditions may specific for example
that 100% of the work for the PPI contract must be performed — and all the staff working on the PPI
contract must be located — in the EU Member States (or even in certain specific EU Member States).
The EU Member States listed in this obligation are then the target countries of this place of
performance obligation.
If a place of performance obligation applies, the beneficiaries must require PCP/PPI providers
to comply with it, including when they subcontract work.
The PCP/PPI call for tender documents and the procurement contract must clearly set out this
obligation and must require that it is passed on to subcontractors.
9. Market access for bidders from non EU countries — WTO GPA — International
agreements on public procurement (HE)
To ensure reciprocal level of market access, beneficiaries must ensure that where the WTO
Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) does not apply, the participation in tendering
procedures is open on equal terms to bidders from EU Member States and all countries with
which the EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement under the conditions laid
down in that agreement, including all HE associated countries. Where the WTO GPA applies,
ensure that tendering procedures are also open to bidders from states that have ratified this
agreement, under the conditions laid down therein.
PCP procurements are generally exempt from the WTO GPA and all other agreements on
public procurement between the EU and third countries because they are for R&D services
contracts (i.e. contracts with the objective to provide R&D services). Access to PCP
procurements can therefore be limited to PCP providers from the EU Member States and HE
associated countries (— and even restricted further in case of restricted calls due to strategic
assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons).
PPI procurements are generally not exempt from the WTO GPA and the other agreements
on public procurement between the EU and third countries. Access to PPI procurements must
therefore normally be open also to tenderers from third countries that are parties to the WTO
GPA or with whom the EU has an agreement on public procurement, under the conditions
specified in those agreements (— except for calls that are restricted due to strategic assets,
414EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
interests, autonomy or security reasons, provided that the restriction also falls under a
specific exemption in those agreements, e.g. exemptions for public security and public
health).
International agreements on public procurement usually also contain non-discrimination
obligations. Country of origin and other local content restrictions are thus only allowed in
PCP/PPI procurements if they fall under an exception/exemption of these agreements (e.g.
for PCPs: all PCPs are exempted, for PPIs: only limited exemptions exist, e.g. for security and
public health).
Example:
1. Due to the exceptional situation on public health created by the corona pandemic, COVID-19
vaccine procurement contracts may currently contain provisions requiring that vaccine production
takes place in the EU Member States and that essential components are sourced from the EU
Member States.
2. Due to exemptions for the utilities sector, public buyers in the utilities sector can reject tenders
for supply contracts when more than 50% of the products come from third countries with which the
EU does not have an international (WTO GPA or bilateral) agreement on public procurement.
3. Due to the exemption for PCP procurements, PCP procurements can require that essential
components for developing, testing and commercialising the solution are sourced from the EU
Member States and the countries associated to Horizon Europe as well as that the PCP providers
locate minimum 50% of the production of products and/or the provisioning of services that result
from the PCP in the EU Member States and the countries associated to Horizon Europe. If required,
e.g. due to security or public health reasons, this requirement could be restricted to EU Member
States.

and PPI grants, HE Programme Guide > Innovation Procurement and General Annexes B and H of
the HE Work Programme.
415EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Annex 5 > HE Co-funded partnerships
Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships (HE)
[OPTION for HE and Euratom Programme Cofund actions: Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships
When implementing financial support to third parties in Co-funded Partnerships, the beneficiaries must respect
the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and
sound financial management
- for the types of activity and categories of persons that will be supported:
- for multi-beneficiary projects (including multi-participant projects): the projects supported
must be transnational, involving at least two independent legal entities from two different EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries as recipients of the financial support
and may also include legal entities established in a non-associated third countries not
receiving financial support
- for mono-beneficiary projects (multi-participant projects): the projects supported must be
transnational, involving one legal entity established in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe associated country as recipient of the financial support and one legal entity
established in a non-associated third country not receiving financial support
- for the selection procedure and criteria:
- publish open calls widely (including on the Funding & Tenders Portal and the beneficiaries’
websites)
- keep open calls open for at least two months
- inform recipients of call updates (if any) and the outcome of the call (list of selected projects,
amounts and names of selected recipients)
- measures to avoid potential conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants must be
ensured (notably through appropriate communication/exchange of information channels and
independent and fair complaints procedures)
- use the following selection criteria: the standard Horizon Europe award criteria
- use the following selection procedures:
- projects must be selected following a joint transnational call for proposals
- beneficiaries must make the selection through a two-step procedure:
- Step 1: review at national or transnational level (including national
eligibility checks)
- Step 2: single international peer review
and in Step 2:
- proposals must be evaluated with the assistance of at least three independent
experts
- proposals must be ranked according to the evaluation results and the
selection must be made on the basis of this ranking
- the selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer,
who must make a report.
416EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Where the financial support is implemented through implementing partners, the beneficiaries must:
- ensure that the partners comply with the same rules, standards and procedures for implementing the
financial support
- implement effective monitoring and oversight arrangements towards the partners, covering all aspects
relating to the action
- ensure effective and reliable reporting by the partners, covering the activities implemented,
information on indicators, as well as the legality and regularity of the expenditure claimed
- ensure that the partnersprovide that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF,
Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the final recipients
- where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons: apply the restrictions set out in Annex 5 mutatis mutandis to the final recipients and
their results.]
1. Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships (HE)
The specific rules (such as the participation of beneficiaries/affiliated entities as recipients of
FSTP) for Co-funded Partnerships apply to certain HE Programme Co-fund types of action
(i.e. calls with COFUND ToA). They replace the former Joint programming initiatives (JPIs),
European research area networks (ERA-NETs) and European Joint programmes (EJPs) Cofund
actions in Horizon 2020.
The Annex 5 provisions focus ONLY on the cascading scenario (i.e. where beneficiaries
provide financial support to third parties (FSTP); so-called ‘co-funded calls’). For
transnational projects implemented by the beneficiaries themselves (as part of the action),
the standard rules of the Grant Agreement apply.
Co-funded Partnerships are ALSO subject to the rules for recipients of financial support
(FSTP) in Article 9.4.
2. Providing financial support vs implementation of transnational projects by the
beneficiaries (HE)
A core part of Co-funded Partnerships is to provide financial support to third parties (i.e. pass
on the EU support they receive via the Co-funded Partnerships grant to recipients that are
not party to the Grant Agreement, also called ‘cascade funding’).
In this case, the beneficiaries’ activity consists in providing the financial support, while it is
the final recipients (‘third parties receiving financial support’) that actually implement the
projects.
Specific cases (co-funded partnerships):
FSTP between beneficiaries — Beneficiaries to the EU grant can in principle NOT also be
final recipient (since that is not the purpose of a cascading grant).
However, if explicitly permitted by the call conditions/Grant Agreement and included and
justified in the DoA Annex 1, there are cases where exceptions are permitted (i.e. where the
co-funded call can be opened also for entities that are also beneficiaries of the EU grant or
417EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
other departments of the beneficiary). In this case, the consortium will be asked during grant
preparation to:
- -propose a clear list of beneficiaries (or which department of a beneficiary, where
applicable) that will have the responsibility of drafting call texts, and managing the
award procedure
- -identify the beneficiaries (or other departments of the same beneficiary) which can
apply for funding under the co-funded call for proposals
- -explain the measures to mitigate (potential) conflict of interest or unequal treatment
of applicants (see information barriers below) and
- -reflect this fully in their DoA Annex 1, both in the context of the description of the co-
funded call and in relation to the monitoring of the transnational projects.
If needed, beneficiaries must set up information barriers (‘firewalls’) to prevent exchanges or
communication that could lead to conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants and
ensure independent and fair complaints procedures.
Costs can be declared ONLY by the beneficiary providing the financial support, NOT by the
final recipient receiving the financial support (even if it is at the same time beneficiary of the
grant and can therefore declare other costs).
3. Calls for transnational projects (HE)
The projects financed under the co-funded calls must be transnational, i.e. for Horizon co-
funded partnerships, they must involve:
− for multi-beneficiary projects (including multi-participant projects): at least two
independent legal entities from two different EU Member States or HE associated
countries which implement the project receiving financial support; in addition the
projects may also include legal entities from non-associated third countries not
receiving any financial support from the EU grant
OR
− for mono-beneficiary projects (multi-participant projects): one legal entity from an EU
Member State or HE associated country which implements the project with financial
support; in addition, to ensure their transnational nature, the projects must include at
least one legal entity established in a non-associated third country not receiving any
financial support from the EU grant.
Note that additional eligibility conditions may apply in specific cases concerning the minimum
number of independent entities (including entities from third countries).
For Euratom Co-funded Partnerships, references to ‘associated countries’ must be understood
as Euratom associated countries (not HE associated countries).
4. Award criteria (HE)
The evaluation in the co-funded calls must be done on the basis of the same award criteria
that are used for Horizon Europe calls, i.e.:
(a) Excellence
(b) Impact
(c) Quality and efficiency of the implementation.
418EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The aspects to be taken into account for each award criterion should also be the same used
for Horizon Europe proposals. Depending on the type of action, General Annex D of the HE
Work Programme should be applied.
5. Two-step selection procedure (HE)
The selection procedure of the co-funded calls must follow a two-step procedure, ensuring
for:
Step 1: review at national or transnational level (including national eligibility checks)
Step 2: single international peer review
and that in Step 2:
– proposals must be evaluated with the assistance of at least three independent
experts
– proposals must be ranked according to the evaluation results and the selection
must be made on the basis of this ranking
– the selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer, who
must make a report.
Only entities/consortia that are eligible for funding under BOTH Horizon Europe rules and
national funding rules should be invited to Step 2.
The co-funded calls and projects must in principle comply BOTH with the applicable
Horizon Europe and with the national funding rules of the beneficiaries.
Best practice: Where possible, the beneficiaries are however encouraged to harmonise the
national rules and implementation modalities for their transnational calls (e.g. by using only
Horizon Europe rules as common rules).
Consortia should be allowed to adjust the budget between Steps 1 and 2, in order to balance
the requested funding and available funding per participating EU Member State and HE
associated country.
6. Independent experts — Observers (HE)
In addition to using expert evaluators for the evaluation of the co-funded calls, the
beneficiaries must appoint, for each call, an independent expert as an observer to verify that
the selection procedure meets the requirements (in particular, for the peer review evaluation
and the ranking).
The observer’s report must be submitted by the coordinator, as part of the periodic report
(see Article 21.2).
7. Ranking list — Joint selection list (HE)
The beneficiaries must base their selection (joint selection list) on the order of the ranking list
(or the ranking lists, if there are different topics).
If proposals have identical scores, the proposals coming from participating EU Member States
or HE associated countries with still available funding can be given precedence, in order to
maximise the number of selected projects.
The ranking list(s) and the joint selection list must be submitted by the coordinator, as part
of the periodic report (see Article 21.2).
419EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
8. Project implementation — Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement
to final recipients (HE)
The implementation of the transnational projects by final recipients will follow in principle the
rules of the cascade grant agreements they sign with the beneficiaries (e.g. usually national
rules, but they can also decide to use Horizon Europe rules as common rules for those
agreements).
In all cases, the beneficiaries must ensure that the users comply with certain obligations from
the EU grant (see Article 9.4).
Obligations that must be extended to recipients:
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding as appropriate (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18)
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are respected by the final
recipients (e.g. through the cascade grant agreement).
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
recipients, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
recipient, the costs will be rejected.

General > Annex 5 > HE ERC Grants
Specific rules for ERC Grants (HE)
[OPTION for HE ERC Grants: Specific rules for ERC Grants
When implementing ERC Grants, the beneficiaries must ensure that the action tasks described in Annex 1 are
performed under the guidance of the principal investigator.
In accordance with Article 21, beneficiaries must submit progress reports (scientific reports) and periodic
reports according to the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Points 4.1 and 4.2). Reports
must be prepared using the templates available in the Portal (ERC scientific and periodic reports).
The internal arrangements set out in Article 7 must cover the decision making procedures for scientific and
grant management issues, the distribution of the EU contribution, internal dispute settlement and division of
responsibilities for cases of rejection of costs or reduction of the grant.
In addition to the obligations set out in Article 17, communication and dissemination activities as well as
infrastructure, equipment or major results funded by the grant mustmoreover display the following special
logo:
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions for the principal investigator and their
team:
- host and engage the principal investigator for the whole duration of the action
- take all measures to implement the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers — in
particular regarding working conditions, transparent recruitment processes based on merit and career
development — and ensure that the principal investigator, researchers and third parties involved in the
action are aware of them
- enter — before grant signature — into a Supplementary Agreement with the principal investigator,
that specifies:
- the obligation of the beneficiary to meet its obligations under the Grant Agreement
- the obligation of the principal investigator to supervise the scientific and technological
implementation of the action
- the obligation of the principal investigator to assume the responsibility for the scientific
reporting for the beneficiary and contribute to the periodic reporting
- the obligation of the principal investigator to meet the time commitments for implementing
the action and for working in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe associated country, as
set out in Annex 1
- the obligation of the principal investigator to apply the beneficiary’s usual management
practices
421EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- the obligation of the principal investigator to inform the beneficiary immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect the Grant Agreement, such as:
- a planned portability of the grant (or part of it) to a new beneficiary (see Articles 32.2,
39, 40, 41)
- any personal grounds affecting the implementation of the action
- any changes in the information that was used as a basis for signing the supplementary
agreement
- any changes in the information that was used as a basis for awarding the grant
- the obligation of the principal investigator to ensure the visibility of EU funding in
communications or publications and in applications for the protection of results (see Article
16 and 17)
- the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights — during the implementation of
the action and afterwards —, in particular, the obligation of the principal investigator to
uphold the intellectual property rights of the beneficiary and full access — on a royalty-free
basis — for the principal investigator to background and results needed for their activities
under the action
- the obligation of the principal investigator to maintain confidentiality (see Article 13)
- for portability of the grant to a new beneficiary (see Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41):
- the right of the principal investigator to request the portability of the grant, provided that
the objectives of the action remain achievable
- the obligation of the principal investigator to:
- propose to the coordinator (in writing) to what extent the action will be transferred
and the details of the transfer arrangement
- provide a statement to the coordinator with the detailed results of the research up to
the time of transfer
- the right of the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court of
Auditors (ECA), etc.) to exercise their rights also towards the principal investigator
- the applicable law and the dispute settlement forum
- provide the principal investigator with a copy of the signed Agreement
- guarantee the principal investigator scientific independence, in particular for the:
- use of the budget to achieve the scientific objectives
- authority to publish as senior author and invite as co-authors those who have contributed
substantially to the work
- preparation of scientific reports for the action
- selection and supervision of the other team members, in line with the profiles needed to
conduct the research and in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual management practices
- possibility to apply independently for funding
- access to appropriate space and facilities for conducting the research
- provide — during the implementation of the action — research support to the principal investigator
and the team members (regarding infrastructure, equipment, access rights, products and other
services necessary for conducting the research)
- support the principal investigator and provide administrative assistance, in particular for the:
- general management of the work and their team
- scientific reporting, especially ensuring that the team members send their scientific results
to the principal investigator
422EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- periodic reporting, especially providing timely and clear financial information (for actual
costs)
- application of the beneficiary’s usual management practices
- general logistics of the action
- access to the electronic exchange system
- inform the principal investigator immediately (in writing) of any events or circumstances likely to
affect the Agreement
- ensure that the principal investigator enjoys adequate:
- conditions for annual, sickness and parental leave
- occupational health and safety standards
- insurance under the general social security scheme, such as pension rights
- allow (for both mono and multi-beneficiary actions) the portability of the grant to a new beneficiary,
if requested by the principal investigator and provided that the objectives of the action remain
achievable (see Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41). The beneficiary may object only on the basis that the
portability of the grant is not possible under national law. In particular, the beneficiary must:
- agree with the principal investigator and the new beneficiary on a plan for the transfer of the
intellectual property rights under the Agreement to the new beneficiary
- transfer to the new beneficiary any part of the pre-financing received which is not covered by
an approved periodic report, if requested by the granting authority
- transfer to the new beneficiary the equipment purchased and used exclusively for the action
— against reimbursement of the costs that have not yet been depreciated (for actual cost
grants) or under fair and reasonable conditions agreed among the concerned beneficiaries (for
lump sum grants) — if requested by the principal investigator and the granting authority, and
unless the transfer is not possible under national law.
For ERC Grants with more than one principal investigator, the above-mentioned obligations must be ensured
by each beneficiary towards their principal investigators and their teams (and by each principal investigator
towards their beneficiary, the coordinator and the other principal investigators). Moreover, the following
specificities must be observed:
- for the implementation of the action: the corresponding principal investigator bears the overall
responsibility for the supervision of the scientific and technological implementation of the action,
while the other principal investigators must contribute to the overall implementation and supervise
each one their parts
- for the reporting: the corresponding principal investigator assumes the primary responsibility for the
scientific reporting and contribution to the periodic reporting, while the other principal investigators
must contribute to both the scientific and periodic reporting
- for events or circumstances likely to affect the Agreement: each principal investigator must inform
the coordinator, their beneficiary and the other principal investigators
- for portability of the grant by one of the principal investigators (Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41):
- the corresponding principal investigator must verify that the beneficiary of the principal
investigator and the coordinator were informed
- the principal investigator concerned must provide the coordinator and their beneficiary with a
statement on the detailed results of the research up to the time of transfer
- for the internal arrangements (Article 7): they must also cover settlement of disputes between the
principal investigators and between them and the beneficiaries).
For ERC Proof of Concept Grants, the specific rules on reporting (scientific and periodic reporting) and the
special conditions for the principal investigator and their team do not apply.]
423EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Specific rules for ERC Grants (HE)
The specific rules for ERC Grants apply to all HE ERC types of action (i.e. calls with ERC ToA,
including ERC SyG and ERC PoC).
ERC types of action that use actual costs also have two special cost categories in
Article 6.2.D.7 and 6.2.D.8.
2. Actions under the guidance of the principal investigator (PI) (HE)
ERC Grants are designed to attract excellence in fundamental research and focus on principal
investigators (PIs).
PIs do not become party to the Grant Agreement, but they are the key actors, in charge of
the research activities. The host institution which hosts and engages the PI is the one that
must apply for the ERC Grant (and will act as coordinator, in case of multi-beneficiary
grants).
For ERC Synergy Grants (SyG), there might be several host institutions (beneficiaries
hosting and engaging a PI). In this case, the coordinator will be the entity hosting and
engaging the corresponding PI, who will be the administrative contact point for the group of
PIs.
The host institution becomes the signatory of the Grant Agreement and formally subscribes
to the legal and financial obligations under it.
The hosting institution must ensure that the action is performed under the guidance of the PI.
Due to the key role of the PI, they can NOT be replaced by any other researcher during the
action. Requests for amendments to change the PI will be rejected.
Combining ERC & other EU grants — ERC grants do NOT prevent PIs from applying
independently (i.e. in their own name) for further EU funding for other actions or for the same
action, but for costs that are not eligible (or not declared) under the ERC grant.
The fact that the funding rate for ERC grants is 100% does not mean that the grant pays for
100% of the costs of the ERC action. Therefore, cost items not declared under the ERC grant may
be covered by other EU funding.
2. Scientific and financial reporting (HE)
The ERC Grant Agreements set out different reporting periods for the financial and scientific
reporting.
The financial reporting corresponds to the periodic reporting in standard EU grants. The
scientific reporting is a special form of progress reporting.
The scientific reporting is done separately from the periodic reporting (i.e. in addition to the
financial reports which are needed to receive interim and final payments).
Normally, the two types of reports alternate between them. At the end of the action, they are
submitted together in a single periodic report, in order to receive the final payment.
For ERC Starting Grants, Consolidator Grants and Advanced Grants, where the usual duration
is 60 months, the first scientific report is submitted after 24 months, while the first periodic
(financial) report is submitted after 30 months. Depending on the overall duration of the
action the periodicity may change.
424EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For ERC Synergy Grants, where the normal duration is 72 months, the scientific reports are
expected at month 24, 48 and 72, whereas the periodic (financial) reports are expected at
month 18, 36, 54 and 72.
Scientific reports (progress reports):
The scientific reports must be submitted through the Portal (Scientific Reporting tool).
These scientific reports include:
– information about the scientific progress of the work
– the achievements and results of the action
– information on whether and how open access has been provided to the results
– information on how the results have been disseminated
– a summary of the achievements of the action, for publication by the granting
authority.
Financial reports (periodic reports):
The financial reports are available directly through the Portal (Periodic Reporting tool).
These financial reports include:
– an overview of the action implementation indicating in particular any significant
deviation in relation to the DoA Annex 1
– a narrative containing information on the eligible costs, including an explanation on
the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
– an individual financial statement
– a consolidated financial statement, created automatically by the IT system (on the
basis of all financial statements submitted by the beneficiaries and affiliated entities
for the reporting period), which counts as the request of payment
– the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (when required by the Grant
Agreement; see Article 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3).
3. Host and engage the PI (HE)
The principal investigator must be hosted and engaged by the host institution, for the whole
duration of the action.
This obligation is also an eligibility criterion for ERC actions. Like all eligibility criteria, it
must be fulfilled for the entire duration of the action (see Article 7) — otherwise the
action may have to be terminated (see Article 32).
Normally the PI will be employed by the host institution, but there may be cases where the
PI’s employer is a third party who makes the PI available to work for the host institution,
where the PI is self-employed, or where the PI has a particular status in the HI (e.g.
‘emeritus’).
The specific conditions of engagement (which normally should be similar to those of an
employee of the host institution) will be subject to clarification and approval by the granting
authority during the grant preparation (or in case of an amendment request).
425EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
4. Supplementary agreement (HE)
The host institution must — before grant signature — conclude a supplementary agreement
(SA) with the principal investigator.
The ‘Supplementary Agreement (SA)’ is an agreement between the host institution and the
principal investigator to set out their internal arrangements for implementing the grant and
govern their relationship during the ERC action.
The supplementary agreement is NOT intended to replace the employment/engagement
contract.
It should cover all the practical issues that may arise in the context of the grant
implementation and must remain in place at least for the action duration (— without any
interruptions). For ERC Synergy grants (i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs),
each host institution must conclude a supplementary agreement with the PI(s) it engages.
The supplementary agreement must be concluded before grant signature (or in case of
portability before submission of the amendment request) and have the following minimum
content:
Main obligations (towards the PI):
▪ Host and engage the PI for the whole duration of the action
▪ Scientific independence, to achieve the action’s objectives under the best possible
conditions, and within the time agreed
▪ Research support, to conduct the research as described in the Grant Agreement
▪ Access to and protection of intellectual property rights
▪ Adequate working conditions, always in accordance with national law and
institutional rules
▪ Administrative support, to manage the legal and financial aspect of the action
▪ Grant portability, allowing and facilitating the transfer of the grant to another host
institution.
Main obligations (of the PI):
▪ Supervision of the scientific and technological implementation of the action
▪ Responsibility for the scientific reporting and contribution to the financial reporting
▪ Meeting the time commitment for implementing the action (see below”)
▪ Applying the host institution’s usual management practices (in particular,
regarding the way the work is organised, the premises where it is carried out, and
the manner in which it is supervised)
▪ Informing the host institution immediately of any events or circumstances likely to
affect the Grant Agreement
▪ Ensure the visibility of EU funding
▪ Upholding the intellectual property rights of the beneficiaries
This obligation is not limited to respecting the host institution’s intellectual
property rights (IPRs). The PI must actively inform it, if they become aware of any
violations.
426EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: The PI reads a research article and discovers a violation of the host institution’s
project IPRs. They are obliged to inform the host institution.
▪ Maintaining confidentiality.
A template for a model supplementary agreement is available on the ERC website. The model
is not mandatory; beneficiaries may use other clauses, provided they benefit the research
action and do not contradict the Grant Agreement (e.g. if the supplementary agreement
contains additional provisions concerning intellectual property, they must allow the host
institution to comply with its obligations under Article 16 of the Grant Agreement).
The granting authority is NOT party to the supplementary agreement and has NO responsibility
for it (nor for any adverse consequences).
It must NOT contain any provisions contrary to the Grant Agreement. Contradicting provisions are
considered void and cannot be opposed to the granting authority.
5. PI time commitments (HE)
The host institution must make sure that the principal investigator ensures a sufficient time
commitment and presence throughout the action, to guarantee its proper implementation.
The host institution must in particular make sure that the PI complies with the minimum
requirements set out in the DoA Annex 1 regarding working time on the action and working
time in an EU Member State or HE associated country.
These two time commitment obligations are as follows:
- % of working time that the PI must work on the action
- % of working time that the PI must work in an EU Member State or HE associated
country.
To be operational, these two percentages must be translated into working days, i.e.:
- minimum number of days that the PI must work in the action over its duration
- minimum number of days that the PI must work in an EU Member State or HE
associated country over the duration of the action.
The calculation should be done as follows:
Step 1 — For each year of the action, the percentages of PI commitment are applied to
215 fixed annual days.
The 215 fixed annual days work as a ceiling: they apply even if the PI works in total
more days (i.e. has other parallel affiliations, freelance activities or work-related
obligations or works more days on the action). In this case, the time commitment is
capped at 100% and the days are calculated on the 215 fixed annual days.
By contrast, if the PI works in total less days than the 215 fixed annual days, the time
commitment obligation will be reduced proportionally (e.g. in cases of part-time
employment, maternity leave, sick leave…).
The total work of the PI will be determined by adding up all their days of remunerated
work, including under contracts with entities other than the host institution.
Example: The % of PI commitment to the ERC action is 50%. The PI works 129 annual days at
the host institution and has another contract with a different entity to work 35 days over the
year. The days that the PI works in total are 164 days (129 + 35). Since this amount is lower
than the 215 fixed annual days, the time commitment obligation will be: 164 x 50 % = 82 days
427EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 — Sum up the results for each year of Step 1 to get the total number of days over
the action duration.
The percentages must be reached for the overall action duration (NOT annually or per
reporting period).
The PI's time commitments obligations must ALWAYS be fulfilled — even if no personnel
costs are charged for them to the project.
6. Transfer of the GA (portability) (HE)
Portability means that the PIs have a right to request the transfer of their grant to a new host
institution — provided that the objectives of the action remain achievable and that the new
host institution meets the eligibility criteria set out in the ERC work programme/call
conditions.
Portability allows the PI to request the transfer of the entire grant or part of it, and it applies
both in case of mono-beneficiary grants and multi-beneficiary grants. In ERC Synergy Grants
(i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs), each PI has the right to transfer their part
of the action. They must inform and consult the other PIs, to ensure that the action’s
objectives can still be achieved.
ERC grants can thus be transferred to a new host institution (‘new beneficiary’) — at any time
during the action.
Transfers without a formal amendment are void and may result in grant termination. The
former host institution remains fully responsible until the granting authority has approved the
amendment.
The transfer may be based on any ground that is beneficial for the PI and does not affect the
achievement of the action’s objectives.
The transfer may be refused, if the objectives of the action do not remain achievable or if
there is an issue with eligibility (e.g. if the PI requests a transfer to an institution established
in a non-associated third country). In this case the Grant Agreement may be terminated (see
Article 32). Exceptions, in line with the applicable ERC work programme/call conditions, may
apply for ERC Synergy Grants.
In addition, the former host institution (‘former beneficiary’) may oppose a transfer if it is not
allowed under national law.
The transfer conditions (including transfer of team members, intellectual property rights and
equipment) should be negotiated with the new host institution, taking into account the views
of the PI.
Amendment procedure:
Portability transfers are done directly in the Portal Amendment tool as in/out amendment
(AT4 beneficiary termination is combined with AT1 Addition of a new beneficiary; see Article
39; new for 2021-2027).
The procedure is therefore in principle the one for consortium-initiated partner terminations
(see Article 32).
The PI should first contact the host institution that signed the Grant Agreement (i.e. the
former host institution).
Best practice: Both the beneficiaries and the PI should keep records of the consultation and
decision-making process for each portability case.
428EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The former host institution must submit a request for amendment to the granting authority
(see Article 39). The amendment should normally cover both the termination of the old host
institution and the addition of the new host institution.
The termination/addition may exceptionally (and in duly justified cases) not be necessary,
if the old host institution remains in the action as normal beneficiary (and the action becomes
a multi-beneficiary action), but in this case the amendment will have to do a change of
coordinator to change the roles (AT11).
The transfer date must be indicated in the amendment request. If the new host institution
joins the action, the transfer date must be the same date as the accession date. Retroactive
dates may be accepted only in exceptional cases, if duly justified.
In addition, the financial reporting periods may be adapted to match the transfer date (can
be done in the same amendment). The scientific reporting periods will usually remain
unchanged (since the transfer normally has no effect on the scientific implementation of the
action).
For more guidance on amendments, see the Amendment Guide and the Online Manual >
Amendments.
Effects:
The effects are also those of consortium-initiated partner terminations (see Article 32).
The host institution must — within 60 days from either the transfer date or the date of
signature of the amendment whichever is the latest — submit:
− a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned (only in case of
multi-beneficiary grants)
− a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate
on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
The documents will be used for calculating the next payment due to the former beneficiary.
The granting authority will moreover instruct the former host institution to transfer the
remaining pre-financing to the new host institution.
If the PI requests it, the granting authority may also require the former host institution to
transfer equipment that was purchased and used exclusively for the action.
The former host institution may oppose this only if it is not possible under national law. It
may however negotiate transfer conditions with the new host institution, taking into account
the views of the PI.
Thus, the new host institution should make its best effort to buy the equipment fully used for
the project. If it does so, it may declare the costs of this purchase (and any other related
costs, i.e. dismantling, transfer and installation), if they fulfil the eligibility conditions set out
in Article 6. In particular, the purchase price should not be higher than the net accounting
value of the equipment at the former host institution (i.e. initial value of the asset minus
depreciation incurred until the transfer).
Specific cases (ERC):
PI employed by a third party — The PI may be employed not by the host institution but by
a third party (from an EU Member State or HE associated country), i.e.:
− a third party that provides the PI as in-kind contribution or
429EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− an affiliated entity.
This must be specifically justified in the proposal (or amendment request) and included in the
DoA Annex 1.
In this case, the supplementary agreement should be signed by the PI, the host institution
and the third party employing the PI.
Retired PI — The PI may be retired. In this case, there must still be an ‘engagement’
relationship, comparable to an employment relationship, between the PI and the host
institution, ensuring that the PI will have the scientific independence and the necessary rights
to supervise the research and the team, and comply with the rights and obligations specified
in the Grant Agreement.
PI who is also the representative of the host institution— If the PI is at the same time
the representative of the host institution entitled to sign the supplementary agreement on
behalf of the host institution (because of their position in the institution), the supplementary
agreement must be counter-signed by another person empowered by the institution. The PI
can NOT sign their own supplementary agreement for both sides.
Portability — If the Grant Agreement is transferred to another host institution, a new
supplementary agreement must be signed with the new host institution. The new
supplementary agreement must take effect from the grant transfer date (or before). The
Grant Agreement cannot be amended before the new supplementary agreement has been
provided to the granting authority.
Former host institution remains beneficiary — If certain team members (or equipment)
stay with the former host institution, while the PI moves to a new host institution, the Grant
Agreement is transferred and changed into a multi-beneficiary grant (allowing both the
former host institution and the new host institution to participate in the grant). The former
host institution stays on as beneficiary, the organisation that hosts and engages the PI is the
new host institution.
If the former host institution remains only for a limited time (e.g. to ensure a smooth
handover), it can then be terminated at a later stage (see Article 32).
Recruitment costs — The host institution must guarantee the PI scientific independence to
select the other team members. Thus, for ERC actions, recruitment costs, if clearly
attributable to the action, are eligible as ‘other direct costs’, even for the unsuccessful
candidates (because recruitment is part of the action activities).
Purchase of scientific publications — The host institution must provide research support
to the PI regarding any equipment, products or services necessary for conducting the
research. Consequently, costs related to the purchase of scientific publications (e.g. books,
manuscripts, articles, digital copies, etc) may be eligible, if their direct link to the action and
their necessity for the action is demonstrated.
Costs for ‘teaching buy-outs’ — The host institution must support the PI and provide
administrative assistance. However, if the host institution hires substitutes to perform some
of the PI’s duties that are not linked to the ERC grant (e.g. teaching), these costs are NOT
eligible.
For more information on participation and funding and successful projects, see the ERC website,
ERC Work Programme and the call and topics pages of the ERC calls.

SINGLE ENTRY POINT FOR SOLIDARITY ACTIVITIES
The European Union is built on solidarity, a shared value which is strongly felt throughout European society. Solidarity
defines the European project and provides the necessary unity to cope with current and future crises by holding a strong
moral ground. Solidarity provides a clear compass to guide the European youth in their aspirations for a better Union.
Young people need easily accessible opportunities to engage in solidarity activities, which could enable them to express
their commitment to the benefit of communities while acquiring useful experience and competences for their personal,
educational, social, cultural, civic and professional development, thereby improving their employability.
The European Solidarity Corps brings together young people to build a more inclusive society, supporting vulnerable
people and responding to societal and humanitarian challenges. It offers an inspiring and empowering experience for
young people who want to help, learn and develop and provides a single-entry point for such solidarity activities
throughout the Union and beyond.
The Programme opens more and better opportunities covering a broad range of areas, such as integration of migrants,
environmental challenges, prevention of natural disasters, education and youth activities, preservation of cultural
heritage, humanitarian aid. It also supports national and local actors, in their efforts to cope with different societal
challenges and crises.
By extending its scope to cover volunteering activities in support of humanitarian aid operations, the European Solidarity
Corps provides needs-based emergency aid and helps to deliver assistance, relief and protection where most needed.
It thus helps addressing not only unmet societal needs in Europe but also humanitarian challenges in third countries.
The activities of the European Solidarity Corps support the objectives of the EU Youth Strategy for 2019-20273 which
encourages young people to become active citizens, agents of solidarity and positive change for communities across
Europe, inspired by EU values and a European identity. The European Solidarity Corps also contribute to fulfilling the
objectives of the Horizon Europe Missions, which tackle some of the greatest challenges facing our societies: improving
the lives of people affected by cancer, adapting to climate change, restoring our ocean and waters, restoring soil health,
and living in climate-neutral and smart cities.
BUILDING ON PAST EXPERIENCE, LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE
The European Solidarity Corps builds on the achievements of more than 25 years of European programmes in the field
of youth and solidarity, especially on the success of the European Voluntary Service, on the EU Aid Volunteers initiative
and on the previous European Solidarity Corps running from 2018 to 2020.

4Part A – What are the objectives, priorities and important characteristics?
WHAT IS THE POLICY CONTEXT?
THE EU YOUTH STRATEGY
The EU Youth Strategy is the framework for EU youth policy cooperation for 2019-20274 within which it shall make the
most of youth policy's potential. EU youth cooperation aims at tackling existing and upcoming challenges young people
are facing all over Europe and provides a framework of objectives, principles, priorities, core areas and measures for
youth policy cooperation for all relevant stakeholders.
An important aspect of the EU Youth Strategy is the 11 European Youth Goals5, which were developed in the context of
the EU youth dialogue through a participatory approach that involved decision-makers, young people and researchers.
These Youth Goals present a vision for a Europe that enables young people to realise their full potential. They identify
cross-sectoral areas that affect young people’s lives and point out which challenges need to be tackled. Among others,
the Youth Goals call for inclusive societies, space and participation for all and quality employment for all young people.
The EU Youth Strategy should contribute to realising this vision of young people by mobilising EU level policy instruments
as well as actions at national, regional and local level by all stakeholders.
The EU Youth Strategy is built on three core areas of action:
▪ ENGAGE
▪ CONNECT
▪ EMPOWER
Under ENGAGE, the EU Youth Strategy aims for a meaningful civic, economic, social, cultural and political participation
of young people. The Strategy fosters youth participation in democratic life, supports social and civic engagement and
aims to ensure that all young people have the necessary resources to take part in society.
Under CONNECT, the EU Youth Strategy underpins opportunities for young people to experience exchanges,
cooperation and civic action in a European context first hand.
Under EMPOWER, the Strategy aims at supporting youth work in all its forms as catalyst for the empowerment of young
people across Europe.
THE EU POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR VOLUNTEERING
Currently, the policy framework for volunteering is mainly set by the 2022 Council Recommendation on the mobility of
young volunteers across the European Union6. This Recommendation aims to eliminate obstacles to volunteering in
Europe by raising awareness, increase the capacity to offer volunteering opportunities, reduce barriers to participation
especially for disadvantaged groups and increase the recognition of skills gained.
Humanitarian aid volunteering actions of the European Solidarity Corps will be guided by the European Consensus on
Humanitarian Aid7 and strive to contribute to enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of Union humanitarian aid, in
line with the Good Humanitarian Donorship principles8. International humanitarian law and human rights law will be
promoted.
THE LEGACY OF THE EUROPEAN YEAR OF YOUTH
One of the transversal priorities of the European Solidarity Corps is to support participation in democratic life, promote
common values and foster active citizenship. This was a key focus of the European Year of Youth 2022 which aimed to
help young people to become active and engaged citizens. Building on the achievements and contributing to the long-
lasting legacy9 of the 2022 European Year of Youth, the Programme will continue to empower young people and to
encourage their participation in democratic life in 2025.

5Part A – What are the objectives, priorities and important characteristics?
WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES, PRIORITIES AND IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS?
OBJECTIVES
GENERAL OBJECTIVE
The general objective of the Programme is to enhance the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible
and high-quality solidarity activities, primarily volunteering, as a means to strengthen cohesion, solidarity, democracy,
European identity and active citizenship in the Union and beyond, addressing societal and humanitarian challenges on
the ground, with a particular focus on the promotion of sustainable development, social inclusion and equal
opportunities.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE
The specific objective of the Programme is to provide young people, including young people with fewer opportunities,
with easily accessible opportunities for engagement in solidarity activities that induce positive societal changes in the
Union and beyond, while improving, recognising and offering validation of competences, as well as facilitating their
continuous engagement as active citizens.
POLICY PRIORITIES
INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
The European Solidarity Corps seeks to promote social inclusion, tolerance, human rights and the value of differences
and diversity of all kinds and to provide all young people equal access to opportunities across all its actions.
The Corps provides accessible and flexible formats of activities, additional financial support as well as a range of support
measures (e.g. general and language training, insurance, support before and after solidarity activities, administrative
assistance) to encourage the participation of young people with fewer opportunities and better cater for their specific
needs. When designing their projects and activities, organisations should have an inclusive approach and make use of
the available mechanisms to involve a diverse range of participants.
The European Solidarity Corps should also support projects and activities actively addressing the issue of inclusion and
diversity more broadly in the society.
In order to implement these principles, a Framework on inclusion measures10 as well as an Inclusion and Diversity
Strategy11 have been developed to support organisations to better reach out to more participants with fewer
opportunities and help addressing the barriers different target groups may face.
Young people with fewer opportunities are young people who are at a disadvantage compared to their peers because
they face one or more exclusion factors and obstacles. The list of barriers, spelt out below, is not exhaustive and is meant
to provide a reference in taking action with a view to increasing accessibility and outreach to disadvantaged groups:
▪ Disabilities: This includes physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which, in interaction with
various barriers, may hinder someone’s full and effective participation in society on the same footing as
others12.
▪ Health problems: Barriers may result from health issues including severe illnesses, chronic diseases, or any
other physical or mental health-related situation that prevents someone from participating in the
programme.
▪ Barriers linked to education and training systems: Individuals struggling to perform in education and training
systems for various reasons, early school-leavers, NEETs (people not in education, employment or training)
and low-skilled adults may face barriers. Although other factors may play a role, these educational difficulties,
while possibly linked to personal circumstances, mostly result from educational systems which create
structural limitations and/or do not fully take into account the individual’s particular needs. Individuals can
also face barriers to participation when the structure of curricula makes it difficult to undertake a learning or
training mobility abroad as part of their studies.

6Part A – What are the objectives, priorities and important characteristics?
▪ Cultural differences: While cultural differences may be perceived as barriers by people from any background,
they can particularly affect people with fewer opportunities. Such differences may represent significant
barriers to learning in general, all the more for people with a migrant or refugee background – including but
not limited to newly-arrived migrants, people belonging to a national or ethnic minority, sign language users,
or people with linguistic adaptation and cultural inclusion difficulties. Being exposed to foreign languages
and cultural differences when taking part in any kind of programme activities may put some individuals off
and, in a way, limit the benefits from their participation. Such cultural differences may even prevent potential
participants from applying for support through the programmes, thereby representing an entry barrier
altogether.
▪ Social barriers: Social adjustment difficulties, such as limited social competences, anti-social or high-risk
behaviours, (ex-)offenders, (ex-)drug or alcohol abusers, or social marginalisation may represent a barrier.
Other social barriers can stem from family circumstances – for instance being the first in the family to access
higher education or being a parent (especially a single parent), a caregiver, a breadwinner or an orphan, or
having lived or currently living in institutional care.
▪ Economic barriers: Economic disadvantage, for instance a low living standard, low income, learners who need
to work to support themselves, dependence on the social welfare system, long-term unemployment,
precarious situations or poverty, being homeless, in debt or with financial problems, may represent a barrier.
Other difficulties may derive from the limited transferability of services (in particular support to people with
fewer opportunities) that need to be "mobile" together with the participants when going to a far place or, all
the more, abroad.
▪ Barriers linked to discrimination: Barriers can occur as a result of discrimination linked to gender, age,
ethnicity, religion, beliefs, sexual orientation, disability, or intersectional factors (a combination of two or
several of the mentioned kinds of discrimination).
▪ Geographical barriers: Living in, for example, remote or rural areas, on small islands or in
peripheral/outermost regions, in urban suburbs, in less serviced areas (limited public transport, poor
facilities) or less developed areas may constitute a barrier.
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE GOALS
The European Solidarity Corps can make a meaningful contribution to the Commission’s commitment to tackling climate
and environmental-related challenges. To contribute to the European Green Deal13, the Programme aims at integrating
green practices into all projects and activities as well as promoting environmentally sustainable and responsible
behaviour among participants and participating organisations. Organisations and participants should thus have an
environmental-friendly approach when designing and implementing their activities. Activities contributing to other
existing EU initiatives in the area of environmental sustainability (e.g. the New European Bauhaus) are highly
encouraged.
The Programme also supports projects and activities addressing the societal challenges related to environmental
protection, sustainability and climate goals. Such projects can tackle a variety of issues, aiming for example at protecting,
conserving and enhancing the natural capital or raising awareness about environmental sustainability and enabling
behavioural changes for individual preferences, consumption habits and lifestyles. The programme supports initiatives
aimed at preventing and mitigating or repairing the adverse effects of extreme weather events and natural disasters, as
well as activities that provide support to affected communities in the aftermath of such extreme weather events or
natural disasters.
HORIZON EUROPE MISSIONS
Relatedly, the European Solidarity Corps are also creating synergies with the Horizon Europe Missions in 2023-27,
wherever the volunteering activities of the European Solidarity Corps can contribute to the ambitions of the Missions
for climate adaptation, ocean and waters restoration, soil health restoration, the promotion of climate-neutral and
smart cities, and the improvement of the lives of people affected by cancer.
In support of these synergies, the European Solidarity Corps is implementing a financial contribution of the Horizon
Europe Programme, earmarked for Volunteering Projects supporting the Horizon Europe Missions and Green Deal goals
and key strategies, thus further increasing the solidarity opportunities available to young people in these areas.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
The political guidelines of the European Commission underline the need for Europe to lead the digital transformation14.
The European Solidarity Corps can play a role by supporting Europeans, regardless of their gender, age and background
to live and thrive in the digital age through projects and activities that aim to boost digital skills, foster digital literacy
and/or develop an understanding of the risks and opportunities of digital technology.
The European Solidarity Corps also promotes the use of virtual and digital components such as information,

7Part A – What are the objectives, priorities and important characteristics?
communication and technology tools in all projects and activities.
PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRATIC LIFE, COMMON VALUES AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT
The Corps promotes participation of young people in democratic processes and civic engagement. With volunteering at
its heart, the programme engages and empowers young people to be active in society and addresses the Europe-wide
trends of youth limited participation in democratic life and the low levels of knowledge and awareness about European
matters that have an impact on the lives of all European citizens.
The activities supported by the European Solidarity Corps should also strive to strengthen European identity (notably as
regards common EU values and, the principles of unity and diversity, as well as participant countries’ social, cultural and
historical heritage) and the participation of young people in democratic processes including European, national, regional
and local elections, and thorough involvement in other EU initiatives, platforms revolving around participation and civic
engagement.
The Youth Participation Strategy15 has been designed to provide a common framework and support the use of the Corps
to foster youth participation in democratic life. The Strategy aims to improve the quality of youth participation in the
Corps and complements key EU Youth Policy documents, such as the EU Youth Strategy, the EU Youth Goals16 and the
Legacy of the European Year of Youth 2022. The Youth Participation Toolkit17 accompanies the Strategy and aims to, in
practical terms, enhance the participation of young people in each of the actions of the Corps, by sharing know-how,
recommendations, tools and practical guidance.
PROMOTION OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND MENTAL HEALTH
Across all its actions, the Corps aims to support activities related to prevention, promotion and support in the field of
health, in line with the HealthyLifeStyle4All, with special focus on supporting vulnerable or disadvantaged population
groups. Volunteers may be mobilised around major health challenges, especially regarding mental health, as well as
policy priorities such as cancer prevention and care.
INNOVATION
The Corps also strives to add value by promoting and supporting new waves of innovation by mobilising young people
and organisations to contribute to awareness of and innovative solutions to a wide range of societal challenges, for
example in the context of rural innovation ecosystems (rural youth depopulation, sustainable energy systems, health
promotion and disease prevention, etc).
In addition, specific annual policy priorities in 2025 for the Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas action will be:
- Relief for persons fleeing armed conflicts and other victims of natural or man-made disasters;
- Fostering positive learning experiences and outcomes for young people with fewer opportunities;
- Promoting waste management and recycling solutions.
For more details, please see section “Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas”.
IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS
In line with the objectives of the European Solidarity Corps, the following features deserve special attention.
RESPECT FOR EU VALUES
The European Solidarity Corps’ implementation, and therefore, the programme beneficiaries, the participants and the
activities implemented under the programme, have to respect the EU values of respect for human dignity, freedom,
democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities,
in full compliance with the values and rights enshrined in the EU Treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In line with the grant agreements, the beneficiary’s grant may be terminated or reduced if such provisions are not
respected.
VOLUNTEERING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CORPS
As one of the most visible manifestations of solidarity, volunteering provides young people with the opportunity to take
part in activities that address identified needs within local communities and contribute to overcoming important societal

challenges on the ground.
Volunteering also enables young people to acquire useful experience, skills and competences for their personal,
educational, social, cultural, civic and professional development, thereby improving their employability and active
citizenship. Activities supported under volunteering constitute a rich experience in a non-formal and informal learning
context, which enhances young people’s competences.
NON-FORMAL AND INFORMAL LEARNING
Non-formal learning refers to learning which takes place outside formal education and training through learning
activities and with some form of learning support. It has a participative and learner-centred approach; it is carried out
by learners on a voluntary basis and is therefore closely linked to young people’s needs, aspirations and interests.
Informal learning refers to the learning in daily life activities, at work, with peers, etc. It can often be characterised as
learning by doing. In the youth sector, informal learning has an important role for example in peer group discussions, in
voluntary activities and in a variety of other situations.
Non-formal and informal learning enable young people to acquire essential competences that contribute to their
personal and socio-educational development and foster their active participation in society, thereby − amongst others
− improving their employment prospects. Such learning experiences have also a strong potential to improve the
attainment in formal education and training as well as to address young NEETs (i.e. young people not in employment,
education or training) or young people with fewer opportunities and combat social exclusion.
Learning activities within the youth field are meant to have a significantly positive impact on young people as well as on
the organisations involved, the communities in which these activities take place, the youth field itself and the European
economic and societal sectors at large.
RECOGNITION AND VALIDATION OF LEARNING OUTCOMES
To ensure the impact of European Solidarity Corps activities on the personal, educational, social, civic, and professional
development of the participants, the competences that are the learning outcomes of the solidarity activities should be
properly identified and documented.
To that end, the use of effective instruments at Union and national level for the recognition of non-formal and informal
learning, such as Youthpass and Europass should be encouraged, as appropriate. For further information, see part D of
this Guide.
EUROPEAN ADDED VALUE
The European Solidarity Corps must support solidarity activities which present a clear European added value, for
example by virtue of their:
▪ transnational character, particularly with regard to learning mobility and cooperation;
▪ ability to complement other programmes and policies at local, regional, national, Union and international
level;
▪ European dimension with regard to the topics, aims, approaches, expected outcomes and other aspects of
these solidarity activities;
▪ approach with regard to involving young people from different backgrounds;
▪ contribution to the effective use of Union transparency and recognition tools.
INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION
The European Solidarity Corps includes a strong international dimension (i.e. cooperation with third countries not
associated to the Programme, through involvement of young people and organisations). Through its extended
geographical scope, the Corps contributes to the EU efforts to support and strengthen capacity and resilience in non-
EU countries. It can serve as a powerful tool for building bridges between diverse societies and fostering connections
between like-minded individuals across Europe and the world.
In accordance with Article 14 (2) of the European Solidarity Corps Regulation, legal entities from other third countries
non-associated to the Programme may be eligible for the actions referred to in Articles 5 and 7 of the Regulation
(networking activities, quality and support measures and volunteering under the ‘participation of young people in
solidarity activities’ strand) in duly justified cases and in the EU’s interest. Among this group of applicants, in line with
the EU Youth Strategy 2021-2027, Council conclusions of 5 June 2020 on Youth in external action and the Youth Action
Plan (YAP) in EU external action 2022 – 2027, special consideration will be given to candidate countries, Easter
Partnership countries and Western Balkan countries, as well as other countries with whom the EU has association or
cooperation agreements. The cooperation with these countries is in the EU’s strategic interest as it fosters the
connectedness of this group of applicants with the applicants of EU Member States.
The participation of these countries is fully in line with the EU Youth Strategy 2021-2027 which calls “to foster the
9Part A – What are the objectives, priorities and important characteristics?
connectedness between young people in the EU and candidate countries, Eastern-Partnership and Western Balkan
partners, as well as with other third countries with whom the EU has association or cooperation agreements.”
“Connections, relations and exchange of experience are a pivotal asset for solidarity and the future development of the
European Union. This connection is best fostered through different forms of mobility.”
In addition, the Council conclusions of 5 June 2020 on Youth in external action stresses the contribution of young
generations to building stronger, more legitimate, peaceful and democratic societies. The programme contributes to
promoting the meaningful participation and engagement of all young people, and hence in strengthening exchanges
and dialogue between young people from the Union and partner countries, including the Eastern Partnership, the
Western Balkans and the Southern Neighbourhood.
This is further supported by the Youth Action Plan (YAP) in EU external action 2022 – 2027. Specifically, the Youth Action
Plan states that the EU will further promote young people-to-people contacts through the existing initiatives like the
European Solidarity Corps, encouraging the participation of young people in volunteering and solidarity projects.The
Programme also supports in delivering the Global Gateway strategy for a Stronger Europe in the World. Cooperation in
volunteering activities has gradually become an important instrument for the implementation of EU external policies,
based on European values, trust and autonomy.Under the EU Enlargement Policy, the European Solidarity Corps aims
to strengthen the informal and non-formal educational and volunteering systems of acceding countries, candidate
countries and potential candidate countries and contribute to the process of aligning their legislation to meet the EU
standards.
Activities in third countries not associated to the Programme take place where there are no ongoing international or
non-international armed conflicts, subject to a substantiated Union’s interest as spelt out under each of the programme
actions concerned.
Based on restrictive measures or guidelines adopted at EU level, some organisations and individuals of third countries
not associated to the Programme, including subsidiaries of such organisations and entities held by such third country
individuals, may not be considered eligible to take part in some or all actions of the European Solidarity Corps
programme.
MULTILINGUALISM
Multilingualism is one of the cornerstones of the European project and a powerful symbol of the EU’s aspiration to be
united in diversity. Foreign languages have a prominent role among the skills that will help equip people better for the
labour market and make the most of available opportunities. The EU has set the goal that every citizen should have the
opportunity to learn at least two foreign languages from an early age.
While the promotion and support of language learning is primarily covered under other EU initiatives, it has been
demonstrated that the lack of language competences is one of the main barriers to European cross-border activities in
general such as those supported by the European Solidarity Corps. In order to help overcoming this barrier, linguistic
support is provided in the context of the European Solidarity Corps. For further information, see part D of this Guide.
PROTECTION, HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PARTICIPANTS
The protection, health and safety of participants involved in the activities supported by the European Solidarity Corps
are important principles of the programme. All European Solidarity Corps participants should have the opportunity to
take full advantage of the possibilities for personal and professional development and learning offered through the
European Solidarity Corps. This should be assured in a safe environment which respects and protects the rights of all
persons, their physical and emotional integrity, their mental health and their wellbeing.
To this end, each organisation participating in the European Solidarity Corps must have in place effective procedures
and arrangements, including repatriation in case of unexpected security crisis, to promote and guarantee the safety,
protection and non-discrimination of the participants in their activities. Such measures should be adapted based on the
needs of the participants. With this regard, all volunteers must be insured against the risks linked to their participation.
A specific insurance policy is foreseen for cross-border volunteers. For further information, see part D of this Guide.
If applicable, it is strongly recommended that participants in transnational activities taking place in EU Member States
or some third countries associated to the programme are in possession of a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).
This is a free card that gives access to medically necessary, state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in any of
the 27 EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, under the same conditions and at the same cost (free in some
countries) as people insured in that country. More information on the card and on how to obtain it is available at
http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=559.
COMMUNICATING PROJECTS AND THEIR RESULTS TO MAXIMISE IMPACT
Communicating projects and their results is crucial to ensure impact on different levels. Applicants are required to plan
their communication activities aimed at sharing information about their project and results during and beyond the
project life cycle. Project applications will be evaluated based on relevant criteria to ensure that these aspects are
covered. The level and intensity of communication and dissemination activities should be proportional to the objectives,
10Part A – What are the objectives, priorities and important characteristics?
the scope and the targets of the different actions of the Corps. Beneficiaries of European Solidarity Corps funding must
follow the communication guidelines for project beneficiaries18 prepared by the European Commission; and monitor
and evaluate the success of their communication activities, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
As indicated in the communication guidelines, beneficiaries must clearly acknowledge the European Union’s support in
all communication and dissemination activities and products, such as events, websites, visual material and publications.
In particular, they must ensure that the European Union emblem19 is included in all communication material and that it
respects the provisions laid out in the grant agreement. The beneficiary’s grant may be reduced if such provisions are
not respected.
WHAT ARE THE ACTIONS AND THE QUALITY AND SUPPORT MEASURES?
In order to achieve its objectives, the European Solidarity Corps implements four Actions structured into two strands:
▪ Participation of young people in solidarity activities:
− Volunteering Projects;
− Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas;
− Solidarity Projects.
▪ Participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities (“Volunteering under the
European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps”):
− Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects.
Additionally, the European Solidarity Corps supports a series of activities and measures aiming at providing high-quality
solidarity activities.
▪ Quality and Support measures
− networking activities for individuals and organisations participating in the European Solidarity Corps;
− appropriate measures to provide clearance requirements in accordance with applicable national law;
− measures taken before, during or after the solidarity activities that aim to ensure the quality and
accessibility of volunteering, including online and offline training, adapted, where appropriate, to the
solidarity activity in question and its context, language support, insurance, including accident and
sickness insurance, the further use of Youthpass, which identifies and documents the competences
acquired by participants during the solidarity activities, capacity building, and administrative support for
participating organisations;
− the development and maintenance of a Quality Label;
− the activities of European Solidarity Corps Resource Centres to support and raise the quality of the
implementation of the Programme actions and enhance the validation of their outcomes;
− the establishment, maintenance and updating of an accessible European Solidarity Corps Portal and of
other relevant online services, as well as necessary IT support systems and web-based tools.

12Part A – Who implements the European Solidarity Corps?
WHO IMPLEMENTS THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS?
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
The European Commission is ultimately responsible for the running of the European Solidarity Corps. It manages the
budget and sets priorities, targets and criteria for the programme on an on-going basis. Furthermore, it guides and
monitors the general implementation, follow-up and evaluation of the programme at European level. The European
Commission also bears the overall responsibility for the supervision and coordination of the structures in charge of
implementing the Programme at the national level.
THE EDUCATION AND CULTURE EXECUTIVE AGENCY (EACEA)
At the European level, the European Commission’s Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA or the Executive
Agency) is responsible for the implementation of a number of actions of the Corps in direct management. In addition
to the information contained in this Guide, the relevant Call documents and application forms for the actions covered
by this Guide and managed by the Executive Agency are published in EU Funding & Tenders Portal21.
The Executive Agency oversees the complete life-cycle management of the projects under the Programme, from the
promotion, the evaluation of the grant applications, the monitoring of projects to the dissemination of the projects and
Programme’s results. It is also responsible for launching specific calls for proposals relating to some actions of the
Programme that are not covered by this guide.
The European Commission, notably through the Executive Agency is responsible for:
▪ carrying out studies in the fields supported by the Programme;
▪ carrying out research and evidence-based activities through the Eurydice network;
▪ improving the visibility and the systemic impact of the European Solidarity Corps through dissemination and
exploitation activities of the Programme’s results;
▪ ensuring the contractual management and financing of bodies and networks supported by the European
Solidarity Corps;
▪ managing calls for tenders to provide services within the framework of the Corps.
NATIONAL AGENCIES
The European Solidarity Corps is mainly implemented through indirect management22, meaning that the European
Commission entrusts budget implementation tasks to National Agencies. The rationale of this approach is to bring the
European Solidarity Corps as close as possible to its beneficiaries and to adapt to the diversity of each country. For this
purpose, one or more National Agencies is appointed in each EU Member State and third country associated to the
Programme. These National Agencies promote and implement the European Solidarity Corps at the national level and
are the link between the European Commission and participating organisations at local, regional and national levels.
Their tasks are to:
▪ provide with appropriate information on the European Solidarity Corps;
▪ administer a fair and transparent selection process for project applications to be funded in their country;
▪ monitor and evaluate the implementation of the European Solidarity Corps projects in their country;
▪ provide support to project applicants and participating organisations throughout the project life-cycle;
▪ collaborate effectively with the network of all National Agencies and the European Commission;
▪ ensure the visibility of the Corps;
▪ promote the dissemination and exploitation of the results at local and national level.
In addition, National Agencies play an important role as intermediate structures for the policy development and
qualitative implementation of the European Solidarity Corps by:
▪ carrying out the Training and Evaluation Cycle in EU Member States and third countries associated to the
Programme;
▪ carrying out projects and activities outside the tasks of project life-cycle management that support the
qualitative implementation of the European Solidarity Corps and/or trigger policy developments such as
Networking Activities;
▪ contributing to the links and synergies between the European Solidarity Corps and the Union youth policy;
▪ promoting and communicating to stakeholders on the opportunities to further engage youth in Horizon
Europe Missions activities;

13Part A – Who implements the European Solidarity Corps?
▪ providing a supportive approach to newcomers and less advantaged target groups in order to remove the
obstacles to full participation;
▪ seeking cooperation with external bodies and National Authorities to increase the impact of the European
Solidarity Corps in their country and in the European Union.
The supportive approach of the National Agencies aims to guide the potential applicants and beneficiaries through all
phases, from the first contact with the European Solidarity Corps and through the application process to the
implementation of the project and the final evaluation. This principle is based on the idea that, to guarantee equal
opportunities to everybody, it is necessary to support target groups through advising, counselling, monitoring and
coaching systems tailored to their needs.
14Part A – Who implements the European Solidarity Corps?
WHAT OTHER BODIES ARE INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS?
Apart from the European Commission, the Executive Agency and the National Agencies, the following bodies provide
complementary expertise to the implementation of the Corps.
RESOURCE CENTRES
The Resource Centres are part of the quality and support measures mentioned in the Regulation establishing the
European Solidarity Corps. They constitute additional entrusted tasks to be performed by designated National Agencies
to support the development, implementation and quality of actions under the European Solidarity Corps. The European
Solidarity Corps benefits from the already well-established network of Resources Centres under the Erasmus+
programme and a dedicated European Solidarity Corps Resource Centre.
SALTO RESOURCE CENTRES
SALTO23 Resource Centres are structures mainly supported through the Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps
Programmes aiming to improve the quality of projects in the field of youth and education. Through their thematic
(participation & information, inclusion & diversity, training & cooperation, digital transformation and green
transition) or geographical (Eastern Europe and Caucasus, Southern Mediterranean, Western Balkans) focus, they
provide resources, information and training in specific areas for National Agencies and other actors and foster the
recognition of non-formal and informal learning. The SALTO resource centres also offer support and develop
trainings, tools and resources for the European Solidarity Corps. Their experience and knowledge thus also benefit
the stakeholders of the European Solidarity Corps.
Their work, directly linked to the Corps, involves:
▪ Coordinating the implementation of Youthpass for recognition of non-formal and informal learning in the
programme;
▪ Carrying out the award and monitoring of the Quality Label in the countries not associated to the
programme;
▪ Carrying out the Training and Evaluation Cycle in the third countries not associated to the programme;
▪ Supporting the inclusion dimension of the Corps and the implementation of the “Inclusion and Diversity
Strategy”.

Corps projects with a view to making the programme more inclusive and diverse.
More specifically, this SALTO also acts as evidence-based knowledge hub and impartial broker based on
its expertise and experience with programme management in the field of inclusion and diversity. This
means continuously building and channelling the knowledge and lessons learned from programme
implementation in this thematic area into the contexts of programme development in cooperation with
the NA network and the Commission through appropriate platforms. Moreover, this SALTO supports the
National Agencies to implement the programme in a way that puts into practice the relevant policy
decisions (e.g. Council conclusions/resolutions), results of mutual learning activities, and decisions on the
inclusion and diversity priority.
Key responsibilities of SALTO for Inclusion and Diversity are:
• Raising the quality and impact of projects and activities of European Solidarity Corps, focusing on
the inclusion and diversity priority;
• Helping to optimise the implementation, monitoring and follow-up of the inclusion and diversity

The European Solidarity Corps Portal is integrated into the European Youth Portal and accessible via the EU Initiatives menu.
17Part A – Who can participate in the European Solidarity Corps?
WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS?
Young people constitute the target population of the European Solidarity Corps. Except for Solidarity Projects where young
people can apply directly, the Corps involves young people through organisations, institutions, public or private bodies that
organise solidarity activities. The conditions of access to the Corps therefore relate to these two actors: the "participants"
(young people participating in the Corps) and the "organisations". For both participants and participating organisations, the
conditions for participation depend on the country in which they are legally based, and on the Action concerned. These
conditions are specified in Part B and C of this Guide, under each specific Action.
PARTICIPANTS
Young people express their willingness to participate in the European Solidarity Corps by registering on the European Solidarity
Corps Portal. The registration on the European Solidarity Corps Portal is possible as of 17 years of age but participants must
have reached 18 and must not be older than 30 at the start date of the activity. For participants in humanitarian aid related
solidarity activities, the upper age limit at the start of the activity is 35 years old.
PARTICIPATING ORGANISATIONS
European Solidarity Corps projects are mainly submitted and implemented by participating organisations. Organisations
participating in European Solidarity Corps projects must be established in an EU Member State or third country associated to
the Programme, or a third country not associated to the Programme .
ELIGIBLE COUNTRIES24
Member States of the European Union and third countries associated to the Programme can participate fully in all the Actions
of the European Solidarity Corps. In addition, some Actions are open for participation of third countries not associated to the
Programme. Please refer to the Actions in Part B and Part C of this Guide for the specific conditions.
24 Entities from EU Member States and people legally residing in them can fully take part in all the Actions of the European Solidarity Corps. In addition, in
accordance with article 13 of the Regulation, the following third countries can be associated to the programme subject to agreements between the European
Union and those countries: members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA); acceding
countries, candidate countries and potential candidates. In addition, in accordance with article 14 of the Regulation, entities from other third countries and
people residing in them can be eligible in some Actions in duly justified cases and in the Union interest.

disabilities etc.);
In the long run, the combined effect of supported solidarity activities is expected to have a positive impact on a large number
of stakeholders in EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme or third countries not associated to
the Programme.
20Part B – Volunteering Projects
VOLUNTEERING PROJECTS
WHAT ARE VOLUNTEERING PROJECTS?
Volunteering projects offer opportunities for young people to take part in solidarity activities contributing to the daily work
of participating organisations, to the ultimate benefit of the communities within which the activities are carried out.
Volunteering is a full-time32 unpaid activity that has a duration of up to 12 months. This type of solidarity activity is undertaken
through participating organisations that offer young people the opportunity to carry out a wide variety of activities, in a
structured way.
Participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the volunteer.
The scope of volunteering projects is broad, covering a wide range of areas, such as environmental protection, climate change
mitigation or greater social inclusion.
Volunteering may take place in a country other than the country of residence of the participant (cross-border) or in the country
of residence of the participant (in-country).
WHICH ACTIVITIES CAN BE SUPPORTED UNDER THIS ACTION?
The following activities are supported:
INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTEERING
Individual Volunteering is a solidarity activity of a duration of 2 weeks to 12 months. This type of solidarity activity provides
young people with the opportunity to contribute to the daily work of organisations in solidarity activities to the ultimate
benefit of the communities within which the activities are carried out.
Individual volunteering activities can take place:
▪ Cross-border i.e. activities taking place in a country different from the country of residence of the participant(s);
or
▪ In-country, i.e. activities taking place in the same country as the country of residence of the participant. These
activities aim to encourage and facilitate the participation of young people with fewer opportunities, however they
are open to all participants.
In-country activities should present a clear European added value including complementarity
to existing national schemes. Projects with in-country activities presenting a weak or a lack of
European added value will not be considered as relevant in the context of the Corps.
In terms of activity duration, individual volunteering can be short term (participation lasting between 14 and 59 days,
excluding travel days) or long term (participation lasting between 60 and 366 days, excluding travel days).
VOLUNTEERING TEAMS
Volunteering teams are solidarity activities that allow teams of participants coming from at least two different countries to
volunteer together for a period between 2 weeks and 2 months.
The composition of the volunteering teams must be international; at least a quarter of the volunteers must come from a
country other than the one where the activity takes place. Examples:
- A grant application is submitted by an organisation legally established in country B for a volunteering activity with 20
participants that takes place in country B. In this case at least 5 participants must come from countries different from
country B (country A, C, D etc).
32 At least 30 and not more than 38 hours per week
21Part B – Volunteering Projects
- A grant application is submitted by an organisation legally established in country A for a volunteering activity with 20
participants that takes place in country B. In this case, at least 5 participants must come from country A, because the link
with the National Agency of the applicant must be preserved (see eligibility criteria on page 25). Volunteers from other
countries may also participate (country B, C, D etc).
In volunteering teams, European Solidarity Corps’ volunteers will carry out tasks for a project over a short period of time
(usually, but not exclusively, during holidays, breaks between study periods, transition from education to work, etc.). Despite
their shorter duration, these activities will be valuable both for the individuals and for the communities in which the
volunteering takes place.
Examples of the valuable work that can be accomplished even over a short period of time include: restoring cultural heritage
damaged by natural or man-made disaster, catering for species threatened by extinction; organising educational activities in
refugee camps, etc.
Volunteering teams activities can bring a significant contribution to the inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities in
the European Solidarity Corps.
The advantages of this specific type of group activities compared to standard individual volunteering activities include the
following:
▪ Volunteers will carry out the activity in a group. This can be an incentive for youngsters who do not feel ready to
embark into challenging experiences on their own. The activity will also be shorter in its duration. This can foster
the participation of those youngsters who cannot commit for a long period of time because of their studies or jobs,
but still want to be of help for the community;
▪ The above makes volunteering teams particularly suitable for a first experience in volunteering. They can thus serve
as an entry way for long-term activities or provide an incentive to start their own solidarity project.
Furthermore, the following additional type of activity can also be funded:
▪ Preparatory visits to the venue of the volunteering activities before the start of the activities. The purpose of the
preparatory visits is to ensure high quality activities by facilitating and preparing administrative arrangements,
building trust and understanding and setting-up a solid partnership between the organisations and the young
people involved. The visits will be organised for activities involving young people with fewer opportunities or when
the visit is necessary for the implementation of an activity with a strong inclusion dimension. Participants with
fewer opportunities that will take part in the planned volunteering activities can be involved in the visit, in order
to help with their preparation and involve them in activity design so that their needs are taken into account from
the start. The preparatory visits can also take place online. However, only the physical preparatory visits will receive
funding.
HOW TO SET UP A VOLUNTEERING PROJECT?
A volunteering project consists of four stages: planning, preparation, implementation and follow-up. Participating
organisations and young people involved in the activities should take an active role in all those stages enhancing thus their
learning experience.
▪ Planning (including defining the learning outcomes, activity formats, development of work programme, schedule
of activities);
▪ Preparation phase, including practical arrangements, selection of participants, set up of agreements with partners
and participants, tailor-made linguistic/intercultural/task-related preparation based on the needs of participants
before departure;
▪ Implementation of activities;
▪ Follow-up phase, including the evaluation of the activities, issue of the certificate of participation, support to
participants upon return as well as the evaluation, dissemination and use of the activities’ outcomes.
Most European Solidarity Corps activities are implemented by one or several participating organisations. All participating
organisations involved in a volunteering activity must hold a valid Quality Label. The organisations involved assume the role
of “supporting” the implementation of the activities and the volunteers and/or “hosting” the volunteers:
▪ The host role covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant, including the
development of a programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the
participant during all the phases as appropriate (some of these activities can be carried out by a support
organisation involved in the same project).
▪ The support role entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, a mediation between
them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity as well
as project management and coordination.
22Part B – Volunteering Projects
Where only one organisation is involved (in-country activities or volunteering teams), the organisation has to ensure that all
phases are carried out and the above tasks and responsibilities are fulfilled. In all cases, the involvement of a support
organisation in activities involving young people with fewer opportunities is highly recommended.
In addition, organisations applying for grant must hold a valid Quality Label for lead organisations. For more information on
the Quality Label, please refer to the section “Quality Label for volunteering in solidarity activities”.
SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS
Young people who want to participate in the European Solidarity Corps must register on the European Solidarity Corps Portal
https://youth.europa.eu/solidarity. Young people with fewer opportunities may receive support from organisations to
complete the registration phase. The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers a meeting place for young people and
organisations holding a Quality Label and willing to implement solidarity activities. Organisations have to select the
participants from the database of registered young people.
QUALITY AND SUPPORT MEASURES
A set of measures and services, such as training, language learning support, identification and documentation of the
competences acquired, insurance are foreseen to ensure the quality of the volunteering activities and a strong learning
dimension for the participants. Some of these measures are optional and could be used depending on the interest and needs
of the participants and some of them are compulsory. Organisations should aim to promote the use of the General Online
Training as part of the volunteers’ learning experience. Detailed information on those measures is available in Part D of this
Guide.
PRIORITIES
INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
The European Solidarity Corps seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness. Organisations should
design accessible and inclusive activities, taking into account the views and needs of participants with fewer opportunities.
Volunteering projects should also aim to support projects and activities actively addressing the issue of inclusion and diversity
more broadly in the society.
To support inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities, additional support measures and
funding that allow participating organisations to better accommodate and cater for the needs of young people
with fewer opportunities are available.
In order to benefit from additional funding applicants will be required to describe how they will involve
in activities young people who are at comparative disadvantage i.e. they have comparatively fewer
opportunities than their peers in the same country/area/age group/situation. In this sense, “involving”
does not refer to a target group that the applicant organisation may work with. It means to facilitate
the participation of young people with fewer opportunities by designing the project activities in an
inclusive and accessible way. This requires specific measures of outreach and support to ensure that
young people with fewer opportunities can participate in activities on equal terms as others.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION
Volunteering activities should promote environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among participants, raising
the awareness about the importance of acting to reduce or compensate for the environmental footprint of activities.
Volunteering activities should be designed and implemented with environmental consciousness by e.g. integrating sustainable
practices such as opting for reusable or eco-friendly materials, reducing waste and recycling, using sustainable means of
transportation.
Projects and activities addressing the societal challenges related to environmental protection, sustainability and climate goals
should also be supported, notably where they contribute to fulfilling the objectives of relevant Horizon Europe Missions. Such
projects can tackle a variety of issues, aiming for example at protecting, conserving and enhancing the natural capital or raising
awareness about environmental sustainability and enabling behavioural changes for individual preferences, consumption
23Part B – Volunteering Projects
habits and lifestyles. Volunteering initiatives should also aim at preventing and mitigating or repairing the adverse effects of
extreme weather events and natural disasters, as well as activities that provide support to affected communities in the
aftermath of such extreme weather events or natural disasters.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
The European Solidarity Corps can play a role by supporting Europeans, regardless of their gender, age and background to live
and thrive in the digital age. Those projects and activities that aim to boost digital skills, foster digital literacy and/or develop
an understanding of the risks and opportunities of digital technology, should also be supported. Depending on the design and
objectives of the activities, the development of competences and awareness on digital issues, and the use of new technologies
can be introduced in volunteering activities within the ESC programme.
Participating organisations are encouraged to make use of digital tools and learning methods to complement and add value
to their activities, to improve the cooperation between partner organisations, support further dissemination of the outcomes
or support for community building. The General Online Training on the EU Academy platform should also be used (see part D
for more information about these tools).
Organisations could also envisage adding virtual cooperation between volunteers, and between volunteers and participating
organisations, before, during and after the activities. Online activities may contribute to lowering the threshold of
participation for young people with fewer opportunities or to strengthening the overall impact of the projects. Blending
volunteering activities with other virtual components may also add to the quality of the project.
PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRATIC LIFE
Volunteering projects should promote participation of young people in democratic processes and civic engagement. With
volunteering at its heart, the ESC programme engages and empowers young people to be active in society and addresses the
Europe-wide trends of youth limited participation in democratic life and the low levels of knowledge and awareness about
European matters that have an impact on the lives of all European citizens.
The European Solidarity Corps supports all participating organisations in improving the quality of their projects by integrating
a participatory dimension, offering young people relevant opportunities to actively engage and participate in the conception
and implementation of project activities as a pathway to discovering the benefits of active citizenship and participation in
democratic life.
Resources for enhancing the participatory dimension of supported projects can be accessed i.e. via the website
participationpool.eu. Links with and involvement in existing national, international or (other) EU initiatives and platforms
revolving around participation and civic engagement are also encouraged.

HOW TO ACCESS FUNDING?
Only organisations that are holders of a Quality Label for lead organisation40 can apply for funding under Volunteering Projects.
The grant applications are based on the activities approved beforehand, during the evaluation procedure for obtaining the
Quality Label for lead organisations. Please read the relevant section for more details on how to obtain the Quality Label.
Thus, a detailed description of the planned activities is not required for this simplified grant application procedure. Instead,
the applications focus on estimating the number, type and duration of activities to be implemented, the number of
participants and proportion of young people with fewer opportunities involved and the policy priorities and thematic areas
addressed.
The activities to be implemented must follow the rules and principles laid down for each activity type in the respective sections
of this Guide.

BUDGET ALLOCATION
In this simplified application procedure, the applications do not undergo a qualitative assessment and therefore no award
criteria are applied. The awarded grant amount will depend on a number of elements:
▪ the total budget available for allocation ;
▪ the requested activities;
▪ the minimum and maximum grant;
▪ the score of the Quality Label application for lead organisation;
▪ applicant’s performance (progress report score, budget absorption and final report score of the last completed
volunteering project, if available);
▪ policy priorities and thematic areas addressed by the activities applied for;
▪ proportion of young people with fewer opportunities involved.
Detailed rules on basic and maximum grant, scoring of the allocation criteria, weighting of each criterion, the allocation
method, and the budget available for volunteering projects will be published by the National Agency ahead of the call
deadline.
33Part B – Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas
VOLUNTEERING TEAMS IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS
WHAT ARE VOLUNTEERING TEAMS IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS?
Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas are large scale, high impact projects supporting voluntary activities carried out by
young people from at least two different countries coming together to express solidarity by implementing short-term
interventions that address common European challenges in policy areas defined each year at EU level.
WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES OF 2025 CALL FOR THIS ACTION?
RELIEF FOR PERSONS FLEEING ARMED CONFLICTS AND OTHER VICTIMS OF NATURAL
OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS
The Corps can add significant value by contributing to the provision of relief and assistance to those whose lives, livelihoods
and communities have been disrupted by the natural or man-made disasters, including armed conflicts. The importance of
solidarity among individuals and communities, within or across borders, has become even more apparent with the Russian
invasion of Ukraine and the resulting big inflow of displaced people into the EU, frequent occurrences of extreme weather
events (e.g. floods and forest fires) as well as large-scale seismic events in certain countries. It is crucial to use the Corps’
potential to implement community-based activities that foster sustained empathy and solidarity among young people and
also facilitate exchange and cooperation between people from different backgrounds.
FOSTERING POSITIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
WITH FEWER OPPORTUNITIES
The Corps can provide significant value by assisting children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds or otherwise
vulnerable groups with the attainment of adequate learning achievements. The European Year of Youth and the European
Year of Skills have fostered the efforts in reaching out to all young people, including those with fewer opportunities.
PROMOTING WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING SOLUTIONS
The Corps can provide significant value by promoting activities intended to raise awareness about environmental issues and
stress the importance of waste segregation and recycling techniques. Involving local communities should be a priority in order
to build positive and sustainable habits and ensure their longevity, which in turn would result in stronger community bonds,
the sense of togetherness and shared responsibility. This priority is particularly relevant in the context of the municipal and
packaging waste targets for 2025 introduced by the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC.
WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES?
Activities by Volunteering Teams in High-Priority Areas will aim to:
• address clearly defined unmet societal challenges in the area of “relief for persons fleeing armed conflicts and other
victims of natural or man-made disasters” and/ or “fostering positive learning experiences and outcomes for young
people with fewer opportunities”; promote solidarity across the participating countries; enable the young people
to gain skills and competences which are useful for their personal, educational, social and professional
development;
• provide tangible benefits to the communities within which the activities are carried out;
• ensure a direct contact between the participant and the beneficiaries of the solidarity-related activities, to enable
the participant to gain skills that are useful for their educational and social development;
• reach out to young people with fewer opportunities, including refugees, asylum seekers and migrants;
• promote diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue - and the EU values of human dignity, freedom, equality
and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities - as well as projects enhancing
media literacy, critical thinking and a sense of initiative among young people;
• reinforce the capacities and international scope of the participating organisations;
34Part B – Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas
• raise young volunteers’ awareness and understanding of other cultures and countries, offering them the
opportunity to build networks of international contacts, to actively participate in society and to develop a sense of
European citizenship and identity.
35Part B – Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas
WHICH ACTIVITIES CAN BE SUPPORTED UNDER THIS ACTION?
The following activities are supported:
Volunteering Teams
Volunteering Teams are full-time42 non-remunerated solidarity activities that should bring together groups of minimum 5
participants to volunteer together for a period between 2 weeks and 2 months (up to 59 days, excluding travel days). The
composition of the team should be international (including participants from at least two different countries). At least quarter
of team members should come from eligible countries that are different from the country where the activity takes place.
Young people can only be involved in one activity at a time. In volunteering teams, European Solidarity Corps’ volunteers carry
out tasks for a project over a short period of time (usually, but not exclusively, during holidays, breaks between study periods,
transition from education to work, etc.). One project should in principle aim to organise volunteering teams for at least 40
participants or more. Volunteering activities should aim to cover one or more high priority areas.
Examples of the valuable work that can be accomplished by volunteering teams under this Action include:
Volunteers are involved in volunteering activities organising recreational and educational activities for children, integration
and promotion of cultural exchange with refugees in local communities, engaging refugees in providing services to the
community and to most vulnerable populations, e.g. regeneration of green spaces, recovery and redistribution of unused
food, recycling of materials.
In Volunteering Teams, volunteers will carry out the activity in a group. This can be an incentive for
young people who do not feel ready to embark upon challenging experiences on their own. The activity will
be shorter in its duration. This can foster the participation of those young people who cannot commit for a
long period of time because of their studies or jobs, but still want to be of help for the community.
The above makes also Volunteering Teams an inclusive format, particularly suitable for a first experience in
volunteering and the participation of young people with fewer opportunities. They can thus serve as
an entry-way for long-term activities or even provide an incentive to start an own solidarity project.
Complementary activities
Complementary activities are relevant side activities designed to add value and augment the results of the project as well as
to strengthen its impact on the local, regional, and/or European level. These complementary activities aim at raising
awareness of the value of volunteering for young people and for communities as well as at strengthening the recognition of
the skills and competences gained by the volunteers. These activities could also enhance the capacity of the solidarity sector
organisations to tackle common European challenges and their abilities to develop volunteering projects.
Complementary activities could include workshops, conferences, seminars, training courses, job shadowing, coaching,
exchange of good practices etc. The complementary activities that require the physical presence of (a) volunteer(s) should
take place within the timeframe of the volunteering activity.
Preparatory Visits
Preparatory visits are visits to the venue of the volunteering activities before they start. They should ensure high quality of
activities involving young people with fewer opportunities or when the visit is necessary for the implementation of an activity
with a strong inclusion dimension. The visit can focus on facilitating and preparing administrative arrangements, building trust
and understanding and setting-up a solid partnership between the organisations and the people involved. Young people with
fewer opportunities that will take part in the planned activities can be involved in the visit, in order to help with their
preparation and involve them in activity design so that their needs are taken into account from the start.
42 At least 30 and not more than 38 hours per week
36Part B – Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas
HOW TO SET UP A PROJECT?
A project is implemented by at least three eligible organisations from at least two different EU Member States or third
countries associated to the Programme and will typically consist of the following stages:
▪ Planning (defining the needs, objectives, development of work programme, schedule of activities etc.);
▪ Preparation (practical arrangements, selection of participants, set up of agreements with partners and participants,
linguistic/intercultural/task-related preparation of participants before departure);
▪ Implementation of activities (including support and guidance to participants during the activities);
▪ Follow-up (the evaluation of the activities, follow-up of participants, issue of the certificate of participation as well
as the dissemination and use of the project's outcomes).
Implementation of cross-border solidarity activities for groups of volunteers are the core of a project. A project must thus
include at least one volunteering team activity and should in principle offer volunteering for at least 40 young people.
A project could also include complementary activities. Furthermore, organisations are encouraged to organise preparatory
visits to ensure high quality of activities involving young people with fewer opportunities.
Eligibility criteria laid down below must be respected.
SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS
Young people who want to participate in the European Solidarity Corps must register on
https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity_en. Young people with fewer opportunities may receive support from organisations to
complete the registration phase. The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers a meeting place for those young people and
organisations holding a Quality Label and willing to implement solidarity activities. Organisations must select the participants
from the database of registered young people within the portal.
QUALITY AND SUPPORT MEASURES
A set of measures and services, such as training, language learning support, identification and documentation of the
competences acquired, insurance are foreseen to ensure the quality of the volunteering activities and a strong learning
dimension for the participants. Some of these measures are optional and could be used depending on the interest and needs
of the participants, and some of them are compulsory. Organisations should aim to promote the use of the General Online
Training and the Online Language Support as part of the volunteers’ learning experience. Detailed information on those
measures is available in Part D of this Guide.
POLICY PRIORITIES
INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
The European Solidarity Corps seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness. Organisations should
design accessible and inclusive activities, taking into account the views and needs of young people with fewer opportunities.
To support inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities, additional support measures and
funding that allow participating organisations to better accommodate and cater for the needs of young people
with fewer opportunities are available.
In order to benefit from additional funding applicants will be required to describe how they will involve
in activities young people who are at comparative disadvantage i.e. they have comparatively fewer
opportunities than their peers in the same country/area/age group/situation. In this sense, “involving”
does not refer to a target group that the applicant organisation may work with. It means to facilitate
the participation of young people with fewer opportunities by designing the project activities in an
inclusive and accessible way. This requires specific measures of outreach and support to ensure that
young people with fewer opportunities can participate in activities on equal terms as others.
37Part B – Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION
Volunteering activities should promote environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among participants, raising
the awareness about the importance of acting to reduce or compensate for the environmental footprint of activities.
Volunteering activities should be designed and implemented with environmental consciousness by e.g. integrating sustainable
practices such as reducing waste and recycling, using sustainable means of transportation.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
Participating organisations are encouraged to make use of digital tools and learning methods to complement and add value
to their activities, to improve the cooperation between partner organisations, support further dissemination of the outcomes
or support for community building. The General Online Training and the Online Language Support should also be used (see
part D for more information about these tools).
Organisations could also envisage adding virtual cooperation between volunteers, and between volunteers and participating
organisations, before, during and after the activities. Online activities may contribute to lowering the threshold of
participation for young people with fewer opportunities or to strengthening the overall impact of the projects. Blending
volunteering activities with other virtual components may also add to the quality of the project.
PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRATIC LIFE
The European Solidarity Corps supports all participating organisations in improving the quality of their projects by integrating
a participatory dimension, offering young people relevant opportunities to actively engage and participate in the conception
and implementation of project activities as a pathway to discovering the benefits of active citizenship and participation in
democratic life. Resources for enhancing the participatory dimension of supported projects can be accessed i.e. via the
website participationpool.eu. Links with and involvement in existing national, international or (other) EU initiatives and
platforms revolving around participation and civic engagement are also encouraged.
WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA USED TO ASSESS PROJECTS?
The projects are selected and managed by the Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA).
Projects will be assessed against the following criteria: admissibility, eligibility, exclusion, selection and award (see part E for
the admissibility, selection and exclusion criteria).

41Part B – Quality Label
QUALITY LABEL FOR VOLUNTEERING IN SOLIDARITY ACTIVITIES
WHAT IS THE QUALITY LABEL?
The Quality Label is a process that certifies that an organisation is able and willing to carry out high quality solidarity activities
in compliance with the principles, objectives and quality standards of the European Solidarity Corps. Obtaining a Quality Label
is a precondition for participation in volunteering activities.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUALITY LABEL?
There are three types of Quality Label, depending on the role(s) that the organisation wishes to play in the process:
▪ Host role - covers the full range of activities related to hosting a participant, including the development of a
programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the participant during all the
phases as appropriate;
▪ Support role - entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, a mediation between
them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity;
▪ Lead role - for organisations who apply for grants, manage and coordinate volunteering projects. This role cannot
be awarded independently, organisations must hold a Quality Label for host/support in order to be able to act in a
lead capacity. Further information on the lead organisations is available in the section 'What is the Quality Label
for lead organisations?' below.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
The requirements to obtain the Quality Label vary depending on the type of Quality Label requested.
The Quality Label is awarded following a fair and transparent selection process carried out by the National Agencies, involving
three main stages: submission of Quality Label application, assessment and award.
The applications for the Quality Label can be submitted on a continuous basis (i.e. at any time). The organisations will submit
application forms by filling in parts which are relevant for the Quality Label roles they wish to play.
Applications are assessed by the National Agency against eligibility criteria, selection exclusion and award criteria (for more
information on this last criterion, see Part E of this Guide).
The National Agency may organise monitoring visits, formal checks or other activities to assess the ability of the candidate
organisation to respect the required quality standards and provide support. Formal checks may take the form of desk checks
or visits to the organisation. The National Agency may request assistance of other National Agencies or external experts in
other countries to check and monitor applications.
The Quality Label is awarded for the entire duration of the programming period, subject to continued compliance with
requirements. The Quality Label remains valid until the end of the last activity in which the organisation is involved as partner,
implemented through a grant of the current programming period. The National Agencies will monitor compliance and may
carry out periodical reassessments.
Organisations who do not hold a Quality Label for lead organisation may act as partners in projects, they cannot apply for
funding.
In order to facilitate partner-finding, profiles of all organisations holding a Quality Label are published in a database46 of
Quality Label organisations.
Once awarded a Quality Label, organisations have access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal where they are invited to
publish volunteering activities for which they are looking for participants. Organisations must make use of the European
Solidarity Corps Portal's database to search for potential participants. Information in the database is published as it is
formulated in the Quality Label application form.
PRE-DEFINED ACTIVITIES AND LOCATIONS
An organisation applying for the Quality Label with a host role must declare pre-defined activities, i.e. standard activities in
which volunteers are involved, with a set of tasks that they will carry out in the organisation.
Organisations applying for a host role may also declare locations during the application for a Quality Label. A location is a
place in which the activities are organised for a specific number of volunteers. A location must not have distinct legal
personality from the applicant host organisation. By default, the main address of the host organisation is considered as a first
46 https://youth.europa.eu/volunteering/organisations_en
42Part B – Quality Label
location, but organisations can declare and host volunteers in more than one location. Organisations can organise an activity
for volunteers that are hosted in different locations, provided that the hosting capacity in terms of number of volunteers is
not exceeded. The locations’ appropriateness to accommodate volunteering activities should be demonstrated in the Quality
Label application. The National Agencies will assess all declared locations against the award criteria. All locations must be in
the same country where the host organisation is based.
The pre-defined activities that the volunteers will be involved in, in terms of tasks to be performed, must also be defined for
each location.
WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES AND QUALITY STANDARDS?
The European Solidarity Corps guarantees high-quality volunteering activities, through the Quality Label process. The activities
are based on a common understanding of key principles and standards, including:
▪ Highest ethical standards. Volunteering activities must be organised by taking into account EU values and ethical
principles highlighted in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union and Article 21 of the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights and other applicable EU, international and national law (including the General Data Protection
Regulation 2016/679).
▪ Equal opportunities and non-discrimination. Volunteers are to be selected in a fair, transparent and objective way,
regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion or disability. No previous
qualifications, educational level, specific experience or language knowledge must be required. A more specific
profile of the volunteer might be drawn up if justified by the nature of the tasks of the activity or by the project
context. Participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the volunteer. The activities should
respect the principles set out in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
▪ Avoidance of job substitution. Volunteering activities must not substitute traineeships or jobs, so that any adverse
effect on potential or existing paid employment is avoided. The involvement of volunteers should complement the
work of paid staff. They should not replace paid staff or undercut their pay and conditions of service.
▪ Avoidance of harmful activities. Security and safety of the participants, participating organisations and target
groups must be ensured. Such security and safety should include appropriate clearance requirements for
participants working with vulnerable groups in accordance with applicable national law. Volunteering activities
should be implemented with due consideration for the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as environmental
crises, conflicts or pandemics. The activities should respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the
Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child47.
▪ Provision of high quality, easily accessible and inclusive activities. The volunteering tasks should enable
participants to develop skills and competencies for personal, social and civic development. Organisations should
embed the activities of volunteers within the local context and to facilitate volunteers’ interaction with the local
community and civil society. The value and benefits of European Solidarity Corps volunteering should be recognised
for volunteers, through identification and documentation of learning outcomes, preferably through Youthpass.
▪ Adequate training and volunteering arrangements. Safe and decent living and volunteering conditions must be
ensured for participants. The young people and the organisations must sign a volunteering agreement that will
outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and will include a well-defined set of volunteering tasks.
▪ No profit. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, beneficiaries must not derive any profit from the activities
funded by the grants awarded (see part E of this Programme Guide for further details). Furthermore, organisations
should cover the participants’ expenditure arising from participation in such solidarity activities but should not
provide them with salaries or an economic benefit.
In addition to complying with the above-mentioned principles, organisations implementing volunteering activities must carry
out the following set of tasks and responsibilities.
When applying for a Quality Label, organisations must be able to demonstrate their capacity to perform the tasks and
responsibilities relevant to the role they are applying for.

The Quality Label (lead, host and support) will be periodically reassessed and monitored at least once during the programming
period (until 31 December 2027) by the national agencies or relevant SALTO centres for organisations established in a third
47Part B – Quality Label
countries not associated to the Programme. The National Agency/SALTO may issue a survey, carry out desk monitoring, use
data from final reports and participant reports, organise monitoring visits, formal checks or request and assess progress
reports or conduct a structured monitoring visit etc. to track the performance of organisations, assess the respect of the
agreed quality standards, and provide support. A progress report is obligatory only for lead organisations, while for host and
support roles, the progress report is optional, and other monitoring methods and sources may be used. Structured monitoring
visit at the premises of the organisation may replace reports/report parts: Progress report for host, support and/or lead role
and/or Locations/Standard activities update. An assessment of the progress report (or a structured monitoring visit) will be
conducted by at least one expert (internal or external).
Formal checks may take the form of desk checks or visits to the organisation and any other premises where activities do take
or have taken place. The National Agency/SALTO may request assistance of National Agencies or external experts in other
countries to check and monitor activities taking place there.
The organisations holding a Quality Label must notify the National Agency/SALTO of any changes in their organisation that
should be reflected in their Quality Label. The National Agency/SALTO can reassess whether that organisation continues to
comply with the conditions that led to the attribution of the Quality Label.
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS FOR THE QUALITY LABELS FOR LEAD
ORGANISATION
At least once during the validity of their Quality Label for lead organisation, organisations will be required to submit a progress
report and to:
• Report on how they are progressing towards reaching their objectives;
• Report on how they are ensuring that the quality standards are respected;
• Update their activity plan.
The National Agency may decide to request a progress report on the different elements (Progress report Lead role, Progress
report Host role, Progress report Support role, Location/Standard activities update, Activity plan update) at the same time, or
separately.
The National Agency may decide to replace the following reports/report parts with a structured monitoring visit at the
premises of the organisation: Progress report (host, support and/or lead) and/or Locations/Standard activities update.
Based on the organisation’s performance resulting from reporting, monitoring and quality assurance checks, or as result of
significant changes in the organisation, the National Agency may change the number and schedule of progress reports.
Organisations holding a Quality Label for lead organisations may request for their Quality Label and activity plan to be updated
and reassessed. This can be done at two-year intervals for the duration of their Quality Label. Requests for administrative
changes that do not affect the activity plans and do not require quality assessment can be submitted at any time.
REMEDIAL MEASURES
In case of organisations who are considered high risk or who fail to comply with National Agency’s instructions and deadlines,
have very low performance resulting from reporting, monitoring and quality assurance checks, or repeatedly violate the rules
of the Programme (including in another action), the National Agency may take the following remedial measures:
• Observation. If put under observation, the National Agency may limit the level of funding that an organisation
holding a Quality Label for lead organisations can apply for. Observation measures for organisations with host
and/or support role may include limiting number of volunteers involved in activities. Organisations who received
Quality Label for the first time may be put under observation if risk of low-quality implementation is identified
during the operational capacity check.
• Suspension. If suspended, organisations will no longer be able to participate in the programme until they have taken
measures and improved performance. Suspended organisations holding a Quality Label for lead organisation are no
longer able to apply for funding. The National Agency may also terminate some or all of their ongoing grant
agreements.
The observation or suspension period will continue until the National Agency determines that the conditions and quality
requirements set in this Call are once again fulfilled, and that the risk of low performance has been addressed by the
organisation.
Organisations under suspension or observation may not apply for a new Quality Label.
48Part B – Quality Label
TERMINATION
In cases of serious underperformance, failure to comply with National Agency’s instructions and deadlines or repeated
violations of the Programme rules, the Quality Label can be withdrawn. The National Agency will give due consideration to
each case of non-compliance and will prompt the organisation well in advance to allow enough time to take corrective
measures.
In addition, the National Agencies may terminate a Quality Label if the organisation ceases to exist or, in the case of lead
organisations, following a period of at least three consecutive years in which no grant requests have been made.
49Part B – Solidarity Projects
SOLIDARITY PROJECTS
WHAT IS A SOLIDARITY PROJECT?
A Solidarity Project is a non-profit solidarity activity initiated, developed and implemented by young people themselves
for a period from 2 to 12 months. It gives a group of minimum five young persons the chance to express solidarity by taking
responsibility and committing themselves to bring positive change in their local community. The project should have a
clearly identified topic which the group of young people wish to explore together, and which is to be translated into the
concrete daily activities of the project and involve all the members of the group. Solidarity Projects should address key
challenges within the communities, where relevant including those identified jointly in the border regions and it should
also present European added value. Participation in a solidarity project is an important non-formal learning experience
through which young people can boost their personal, educational, social and civic development.
A solidarity project will typically consist of the following stages:
▪ Planning;
▪ Preparation;
▪ Implementation of the activities;
▪ Follow-up (including the evaluation of the activities as well as the sharing of project's results).
WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES?
A Solidarity Project should clearly refer to the European Solidarity Corps' objectives and principles in particular solidarity.
This common value provides the necessary unity to cope with current and future societal challenges, which young Europeans
are willing to help address by expressing their solidarity in practice. A Solidarity Project could address young people facing
situations that make their inclusion in society more difficult. A solidarity project should also consider sustainable and
environmental-friendly practices in the planned activities.
The young people should take the initiative to respond to the issues and challenges around them, which is why a solidarity
project should be directly linked to the local community they live in, although some of them can also tackle regional or even
national issues. Some solidarity projects could also tackle common challenges identified jointly in the border regions. A
Solidarity Project should have an impact on the local community by addressing local issues, targeting a specific group or
developing local opportunities (particularly in communities located in rural, isolated, marginalised or cross-border areas) but
also through involving different actors and developing new partnerships. Thus, by setting common goals and cooperating to
achieve them, communities can benefit from a solidarity project.
Together with addressing the local challenges, a solidarity project should also demonstrate European added value by
addressing priorities identified at European level. A solidarity project should reflect a common concern for topics within the
European society, such as for example integrating third-country nationals, climate change or active democratic participation.
The European added value can be expressed through any element of a solidarity project that is linked with European issues,
values and priorities. The European priorities will also be promoted through sharing of the results of the project. In cases of
cross-border projects it should be clear what common challenges are jointly shared by the local communities spread over the
border and living in proximity and how a solidarity project could bring benefits to those regions by addressing them50.
Participation in a Solidarity Project will also be an important non-formal learning experience for young people. It should foster
sense of initiative, active European citizenship and entrepreneurial spirit. In particular, young people managing the project
could absorb in practice the concept of social entrepreneurship by creating new products or services that benefit local
community or society in general and address important societal challenges. By putting their own ideas into practice, meeting
unexpected situations and finding solutions for them, trying out innovative and creative measures, young people will learn
new skills and develop their capacities, express their own creativity and take responsibility for their action. They will boost
their self-esteem, autonomy and motivation to learn. Participation in managing and implementing a solidarity project could
be also a first step into self-employment or setting up organisations in the solidarity, non-profit or youth sectors.
50 A flexibility is allowed in a definition of cross-border regions which can include also regions spread by a sea, as long as the common challenges that a project
will address are clearly identified.
50Part B – Solidarity Projects
HOW TO SET UP A SOLIDARITY PROJECT?
Young people who want to form a group to run a solidarity project must be registered in the European Solidarity Corps portal
as a first step, in order to apply to a solidarity project. There is no maximum number of the group’s members. The activities
will take place in the country of residence of the applicant, facilitating in particular the participation of young people who may
encounter difficulties to engage in transnational activities.
The group will decide autonomously on the working methods and how the project will be managed. One of the group’s
members will assume a role of legal representative who will submit the application (unless an organisation applies on behalf
of the group). The group will arrange the distribution of tasks and responsibilities, ensure efficient coordination and
communication between its members and define the amount of time spent in carrying out the tasks in relation to the goals
of the project. Working methods should aim to involve all members of the group through various phases of the project and
of activities (preparation, implementation and sharing the results). The phases should be clearly structured with the help of
a project’s timetable.
A group of young people who plan a solidarity project can seek for support from an organisation (any public or private body).
An organisation may apply on their behalf for a grant under the European Solidarity Corps. The role of the organisation should
be administrative, to support the group in the project life-cycle administrative and financial tasks. However, it can also offer
support and guidance in identifying and documenting learning outcomes.
Young people carrying out a Solidarity Project may be supported by coaches. A coach is a resource person who could have
youth work experience to accompany groups of young people and support their participation through different phases of the
project. The coach will remain outside the Solidarity Project, so he/she will not be a member of the group and if needed, can
come from an organisation applying on behalf of the group. The coach empowers the group of young people in those areas
and topics they need support in, so that they can successfully implement the project by themselves, and (s)he can play
different roles based on the needs of the group. This could be done through regular coaching sessions throughout the project
period, punctual trainings on specific topics or a combination of both. The coach can provide advice on having quality learning
process and assist in identifying and documenting learning outcomes at the end of the project. The group of young people
can use the support of one or several coaches depending on their needs. As a principle, the coach works with the applying
group of young people, not with the target group(s) of the project.
For example, a coach could be a person to turn to with doubts, questions, conflicts in the group; a trainer to give a workshop
on project management; to teach the group certain skills needed for the project; a person supporting and monitoring the
learning process.
Through the different phases of the project, the group should reflect on the learning process, which they experience and have
experienced. During the planning phase of the project, the learning goals should be discussed together with the general aims
of the project. During the implementation, regular reflection is encouraged and towards the end of the project, the group
should consider measures that make the learning outcomes visible. For recognising and validating these learning outcomes it
is recommended to use Youthpass and the related learning process reflection.
The group should reflect together on measures aimed at the visibility of their project and the visibility of the European
Solidarity Corps in general. The group should also reflect on follow-up measures. This means that the project should be
framed within a longer-term perspective and planned with a view to have effects after it ends. In order to make the project
and its results more sustainable, the group is expected to carry out a final evaluation. This should make possible to assess
whether the objectives of the project have been achieved; the expectations of the group have been met and evaluate the
overall success. The group should consider the ways of sharing the results of the project and reflect on with who they should
be shared.
PRIORITIES
INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
The European Solidarity Corps seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness. Young people
implementing Solidarity Projects should design accessible and inclusive activities, taking into account the needs of participants
with fewer opportunities. Special funding for the participation of people with fewer opportunities is available both for the
members of the group and the target group.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION
Solidarity Projects should promote environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among participants, raising the
awareness about the importance of acting to reduce or compensate for the environmental footprint of activities. Solidarity
Projects should be designed and implemented with environmental consciousness by e.g. integrating sustainable practices
such as reducing waste and recycling, using sustainable means of transportation.
51Part B – Solidarity Projects
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
The European Solidarity Corps supports incorporating the use of digital tools and learning methods in Solidarity Projects.
Groups of young people implementing solidarity projects are encouraged to make use of digital tools and learning methods
to complement the physical activities and add to the quality of the project.
PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRATIC LIFE
The European Solidarity Corps supports integrating a participatory dimension in solidarity projects, offering young people
relevant opportunities to actively engage and participate in the conception and implementation of project activities as a
pathway to discovering the benefits of active citizenship and participation in democratic life.

Before submitting an application, applicants are advised to read carefully the entire section.
WHICH ACTIONS ARE SUPPORTED?
Under this strand, the European Solidarity Corps supports volunteering in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities.
Given the significant increase in global humanitarian needs and with a view to enhancing the promotion of solidarity and the
visibility of humanitarian aid among Union citizens, there is a need to develop solidarity between Member States and with
third countries affected by man-made or natural disasters. Contributing to assistance to people and communities outside the
Union in need of humanitarian aid, based on the fundamental principles of neutrality, humanity, independence and
impartiality, is an important expression of solidarity.
Activities implemented under the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps aim at contributing to providing needs-based
humanitarian aid aimed at preserving life, preventing and alleviating human suffering and maintaining human dignity and to
strengthening the capacity and resilience of vulnerable or disaster-affected communities. Humanitarian Aid Volunteering
projects funded under this strand will offer the opportunity to young people aged 18 to 35 years old to participate in
volunteering activities, aiming at supporting humanitarian aid operations. Such activities will provide young people with the
opportunity to carry out tasks needed to support the activities undertaken by their host organisation.
To ensure the safety of young people, volunteering under this strand may only take place in countries:
▪ where humanitarian aid activities and operations take place; and
▪ where there are no ongoing international or non-international armed conflicts53.
53 Art 10(2) of the REGULATION (EU) 2021/888 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 May 2021 establishing the European Solidarity Corps

56Part C – Participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities
QUALITY LABEL FOR HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING
WHAT IS THE QUALITY LABEL?
The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering certifies that an organisation is able to carry out high quality solidarity
activities in compliance with the principles, objectives and requirements of the action ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid
Corps’. Obtaining this Quality Label is a precondition for participation only in volunteering activities in support of humanitarian
aid operations.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUALITY LABEL?
When applying for a Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering, applicant organisations can choose one of the following
roles:
▪ Support role – entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, mediation between
them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity. The
support role also entitles the organisation to submit project applications and coordinate partnerships for
Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects;
▪ Host role – covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant, including the
development of a programme of the young person’s activities and providing guidance and support to the
participant during all the phases as appropriate.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering is awarded following a selection process, involving three main stages:
submission of application, assessment and award.
The applications for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering can be submitted on a continuous basis (i.e. at any
time) during the programming period, to the Executive Agency, which is the sole implementing body for this action. The
applications will be evaluated at set intervals, according to an annual timetable, which is aligned to the timetable of the
Humanitarian Aid Volunteering call for projects.
Applications will be assessed against admissibility, eligibility, selection, exclusion and award criteria (for more information on
the admissibility, selection and exclusion criteria, see Part E of this Guide). Successful organisations will be awarded the Quality
Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering. The Executive Agency will award this Quality Label and monitor compliance and may
carry out periodical reassessments. The Quality Label will be valid for the entire duration of the programming period and until
the end of the last project in which the organisation is involved.
In order to facilitate partner-finding and the setting up of project consortia, profiles of all organisations holding this Quality
Label are published in a database54 of Quality Label organisations on the European Solidarity Corps Portal. To identify potential
partners, partner searching tool on the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal55 can be used.
APPLYING FOR A QUALITY LABEL ON BEHALF OF SUPPORTING OR HOSTING
ORGANISATIONS
An organisation that applies for a Quality Label in a support role or in a host role may also apply for host role on behalf of its
branches located in those regions of third countries where humanitarian aid activities and operations take place and where
there are no ongoing international or non-international armed conflicts, and with which it shares the same legal personality.
This procedure is designed to help larger organisations, with several branches, including when they are located in different
countries.
The applicant organisation is accountable for the quality and safety of the activities offered by host organisation(s) on behalf
of which it is applying.

57Part C – Participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities
WHAT ARE THE QUALITY STANDARDS?
The European Solidarity Corps guarantees high-quality volunteering activities, through the Quality Label process. Participating
organisations must respect the following principles and standards:
▪ Equal opportunities and non-discrimination. Volunteers are to be selected in a fair, transparent and objective way,
regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion or disability. No previous
qualifications, educational level, specific experience or language knowledge must be required. In order to promote
inclusion, participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the volunteer. The activities should
respect the principles set out in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
▪ Avoidance of job substitution. Volunteering activities must not substitute traineeships or jobs, so that any adverse
effect on potential or existing paid employment is avoided. The involvement of volunteers should complement the
work of paid staff. They should not replace paid staff or undercut their pay and conditions of service.
▪ Avoidance of harmful activities. Security and safety of the young people, participating organisations and target
groups must be ensured. Such security and safety should include appropriate clearance requirements for
volunteers working with vulnerable groups in accordance with applicable national law. Volunteering activities
should be implemented with due consideration for the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as environmental
crises, conflicts or pandemics. The activities should respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the
Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child56.
▪ Provision of high quality, easily accessible and inclusive activities. The volunteering tasks should enable young
people to develop skills and competencies for personal, social and civic development. Particular attention will be
given to the capacity of hosting organisations in third countries and the need to embed the activities of volunteers
within the local context and to facilitate volunteers’ interaction with local humanitarian actors, the hosting
community and civil society. The value and benefits of European Solidarity Corps volunteering should be recognised
for volunteers, through identification and documentation of learning outcomes, preferably through Youthpass.
▪ Adequate training, working and volunteering arrangements. Safe and decent living and working conditions must
be ensured for volunteers. The young people and the organisations must sign a volunteering agreement that will
outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and will include a well-defined set of volunteering tasks.
▪ “No profit”. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, beneficiaries must not derive any profit from the activities
funded by the grants awarded. Furthermore, volunteering should cover the participants’ expenditure arising from
participation in such solidarity activities but should not provide them with salaries or an economic benefit.
TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ORGANISATIONS HOLDING A QUALITY LABEL FOR
HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING
In addition to complying with the above-mentioned principles, organisations implementing humanitarian aid volunteering
projects must carry out specific tasks and responsibilities in order to ensure high quality activities. When applying for a Quality
Label, organisations must be able to demonstrate their capacity to perform the tasks and take up responsibilities relevant to
the role they are applying for, as outlined in the requirements below. This list is not comprehensive, and in some cases, the
set of tasks and responsibilities may overlap between host and support organisations, without prejudice to the overall quality
of the activity.

VOLUNTEERING UNDER THE EUROPEAN VOLUNTARY HUMANITARIAN AID
CORPS (HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING)
WHAT IS VOLUNTEERING IN SUPPORT OF HUMANITARIAN AID OPERATIONS?
Volunteering under the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps60 (Humanitarian Aid Volunteering) takes place in third
countries where there are ongoing humanitarian aid operations. This action gives the opportunity to young people aged 18
to 35 years old to contribute to society by short-term or long-term volunteering activities aimed at improving living conditions
of people in need. Volunteering is a full-time61 non-remunerated activity. Projects must be in line with the humanitarian aid
principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, as well as with the ‘do no harm’ principle.
WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES?
The projects funded under Humanitarian Aid volunteering should:
a. where relevant, facilitate the transition from the humanitarian response to long-term sustainable and inclusive
development
b. contribute to strengthening the capacity and resilience of vulnerable or disaster-affected communities;
c. reinforce disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction;
d. link relief, rehabilitation and development;
e. ensure a high level of safety and security for volunteers.
Additionally, to increase the quality and impact of the action on local communities, projects could include complementary
activities. They should also facilitate the active involvement of local staff and volunteers from the countries and communities
in which they are implemented.
WHICH ACTIVITIES CAN BE SUPPORTED?
The following activities are supported under Humanitarian Aid Volunteering:
• Individual volunteering
• Volunteering teams
• Complementary activities
INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTEERING
Individual volunteering is an activity in the field of humanitarian aid of a duration of 2 to 12 months, excluding travel time.
This type of volunteering provides young people with the opportunity to carry out tasks needed to support the activities
undertaken by the host organisation.
Individual volunteering activities take place cross-border, in a country different from the country of residence of the
volunteer(s), as detailed in the section on general eligibility criteria – “geographical location”.
Mentor expertise should support the individual volunteering activities.

Volunteering teams are activities that allow in principle teams of 5 to 40 participants coming from at least two different EU
Member States or third countries associated to the Programme to volunteer together for a period between 2 weeks and 2
months (up to 59 days , excluding travel time).
Volunteering teams activities take place cross-border, in a country different from the country of residence of the participants,
as detailed in the section on general eligibility criteria – “geographic location”.
In volunteering teams, volunteers are deployed over a short period of time to perform a clearly defined activity, which can be
realised in a short time frame. Despite their short duration, these activities will be valuable both for the volunteers and for the
communities benefitting from this service. This format may facilitate the participation of people with fewer opportunities due
to the short duration and the participation in a collective endeavour.
Specific mentor expertise could be involved in support of the activities of volunteering teams and could be reinforced where
young people with fewer opportunities are involved.
The advantages of this specific type of group activities compared to individual volunteering activities include the following:
• Volunteers will carry out the activity in a group. This can be an incentive for young people who do not feel ready to
embark into challenging experiences on their own;
• The activity will be shorter in its duration. This can foster the participation of those young people who cannot commit
for a long period of time because of their studies or jobs, but still want to be of help for the local community.
COMPLEMENTARY ACTIVITIES
Complementary activities are relevant side activities related to the projects and designed to add value, give more resonance
to their results and increase their impact on local and/or regional level. Such complementary activities aim also at raising
awareness on the value of volunteering and solidarity at local level, reaching out to the local community. The complementary
activities that require the physical presence of (a) volunteer(s) should take place within the timeframe of the volunteering
activity.
Complementary activities can contribute to capacity building of local organisations and communities, to create a feeling of
ownership by actors at local level. Specific expertise and experienced/professional profiles can be contracted in this
framework, aiming to ensure further support to volunteers (including people with fewer opportunities) and intergenerational
sharing of experience.
Complementary activities could include meetings, coaching, conferences, job shadowing, training courses, practical workshops
involving local youth, etc.
HOW TO SET UP A PROJECT?
A project supported by this strand should include one or more volunteering activities with at least 15 participants per project.
The volunteering activities can be combined in a flexible manner, depending on the objectives of the project, the identified
needs at local level and the needs of the participating organisation(s) and volunteers.
A project is implemented by at least three eligible applicants with a valid Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering, of
which at least two must be support organisations from two different countries and at least one host organisation with no
affiliation to another support organisation taking part in the project.
A project will typically consist of the following stages:
• Planning (defining the needs, objectives, development of work programme, schedule of activities, etc.);
• Preparation (practical arrangements, selection of volunteers, set up of agreements with partners and participants,
linguistic/intercultural/learning and task-related preparation of volunteers before departure, preparatory
meetings);
• Implementation of volunteering activities (including support and guidance to volunteers during the activities);
• Follow-up (including the evaluation of the activities, issue of the certificate of participation as well as the
dissemination and exploitation of the project’s outcomes).
66Part C – Participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities
All participating organisations involved in Humanitarian Aid Volunteering must hold a valid Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid
Volunteering. For more information on the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering, please refer to the relevant
section of this Guide (Part C – Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering).
Organisations taking part in Humanitarian Aid Volunteering should cover the following roles:
• A support role that entails supporting, preparing and/or training volunteers before departure (including tailor made
training for people with fewer opportunities), a mediation between them and their host organisations and/or
providing support to volunteers upon return from their activity. The support role also entitles the coordinator to
submit project applications and manage the consortium.
• A host role that covers the full range of activities related to hosting a volunteer, including the development of a
programme of the volunteer’s activities and providing guidance and support to the volunteer during all the phases
of the project as appropriate (some of these activities can be carried out by a support organisation involved in the
same project). Specific arrangements for people with fewer opportunities must be put in place.
Associated partner organisations may contribute to a project to cater for specific needs, such as to facilitate the inclusion of
young people with fewer opportunities. Associated partner organisations do not need to hold a Quality Label for
humanitarian aid volunteering, as they are not meant to host and send volunteers.
Arrangements and procedures foreseen by the host organisation to ensure the security and safety of volunteers, including for
their safe return in case of a serious security incident, must be in place prior to the arrival of the volunteer at the place of the
volunteering activity in a third country.
No age limit applies to coaches, mentors and experts, who are part of the ‘learning and training component’ for Humanitarian
Aid Volunteering as set out in Article 10(1) and are not considered as ‘participants’ in the sense of Article 2(3) of the
Regulation.
SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS
Young people who want to participate in the European Solidarity Corps must register on the European Solidarity Corps
Portal62. Young people with fewer opportunities may receive support from appropriate entities specialised in dealing with
young people with fewer opportunities, to complete the registration phase. The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers a
meeting place for young people and organisations holding a Quality Label and willing to implement solidarity activities.
Organisations have to select participants that are registered in the Portal and successfully completed the mandatory trainings
organised by the Commission.
Young people interested in participating in Humanitarian Aid Volunteering need to complete on the EU Academy63 Portal a
self-assessment and specific online training, followed by a test. This option is usually available throughout the year – however,
the access to the training environment can be temporarily closed in case of too high demand. Those who pass the test may
be invited for a face-to-face training of 5 days, offered in several training venues in Europe. It should be noted that the number
of places for face-to-face training is limited. Upon completion of the face-to-face training, the candidates will be able to apply
for vacancies proposed by Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects for individual volunteering or for volunteering teams. The
project members will manage the entire selection process and inform the candidates on its outcome.
QUALITY AND SUPPORT MEASURES
A set of measures and services, such as training, language learning support, insurance, identification and documentation of
the competences acquired are foreseen to ensure the quality of the volunteering activities and a strong learning dimension
for the young people. Some of these measures are optional and could be used depending on the interest and needs of the
young people and some of them are compulsory. Organisations should aim to promote the use of the General Online Training
and the Online Language Support and assessment offered by the Commission as part of the volunteers’ learning experience.
Detailed information on those measures is available in Part D of this Guide.

67Part C – Participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities
PRIORITIES
INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
The European Solidarity Corps seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness. Organisations should
design accessible and inclusive activities, taking into account the views and needs of participants with fewer opportunities.
To support inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities, additional support measures and
funding that allow participating organisations to better accommodate and cater for the needs of young people
with fewer opportunities are available.
In order to benefit from additional funding applicants will be required to describe how they will involve
in activities young people who are at comparative disadvantage i.e. they have comparatively fewer
opportunities than their peers in the same country/area/age group/situation. In this sense, “involving”
does not refer to a target group that the applicant organisation may work with. It means to facilitate
the participation of young people with fewer opportunities by designing the project activities in an
inclusive and accessible way. This requires specific measures of outreach and support to ensure that
young people with fewer opportunities can participate in activities on equal terms as others.
Wherever relevant, projects should take into account the specific needs of women and seek
to involve women and groups and networks of women.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION
A project should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organisations and volunteers involved should have an
environmental-friendly approach when designing the activities, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about
environmental issues, make them think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener
ways of implementing their activities.
Volunteering activities should promote environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among young people, raising
the awareness about the importance of acting to reduce or compensate for the environmental footprint of activities.
Volunteering activities should be designed and implemented with environmental consciousness by e.g. integrating sustainable
practices such as reducing waste and recycling.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
Participating organisations are encouraged to make use of digital tools and learning methods to complement and add value
to their activities, to improve the cooperation between partner organisations, support further dissemination of the outcomes
or support for community building. The General Online Training and the Online Language Support, available in EU Academy,
should also be used (see part D for more information about these tools).
Organisations could also envisage adding virtual cooperation between volunteers, and between volunteers and participating
organisations, before, during and after the activities. Online activities may contribute to lowering the threshold of
participation for young people with fewer opportunities or to strengthening the overall impact of the projects. Blending
volunteering activities with other virtual components may also add to the quality of the project.
PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRATIC LIFE
The European Solidarity Corps supports all participating organisations in improving the quality of their projects by integrating
a participatory dimension, offering young people relevant opportunities to actively engage and participate in the conception
and implementation of project activities as a pathway to discovering the benefits of active citizenship and participation in
democratic life. Resources for enhancing the participatory dimension of supported projects can be accessed i.e. via the
website participationpool.eu. Links with and involvement in existing national, international or (other) EU initiatives and
platforms revolving around participation and civic engagement are also encouraged.

ART UALITY AND SUPPORT MEASURES
In this Part, readers will find the following information:
▪ a description of the support measures;
▪ a description of their objectives and for whom they are;
▪ additional information on key elements of the participation in a European Solidarity Corps project.
The Quality and Support measures described in this section are relevant only for the Actions covered under this Guide.
Before submitting an application, applicants are advised to read carefully the entire section.
WHICH MEASURES ARE SUPPORTED?
The European Solidarity Corps provides a range of quality and support services for participants and participating organisations.
These measures vary depending on the Action and the type of activity the participants and organisations are involved in.
▪ Support to learning
− Mentoring;
− General Online Training;
− Language Learning Support;
− Compulsory training for candidate volunteers in humanitarian aid volunteering;
− Training and Evaluation cycle;
− Recognition of Learning Outcomes.
▪ Insurance
▪ European Solidarity Corps Portal
▪ European Solidarity Corps Youth Card

WHAT ARE THE AIMS OF THESE MEASURES?
As far as quality and support measures are concerned, the specific objectives of the European Solidarity Corps shall be pursued
through actions that aim:
▪ to ensure compliance with the principles and objectives of the European Solidarity Corps on the part of all public
and private organisations seeking to participate in the activities of the European Solidarity Corps;
▪ to ensure that the solidarity activities that are offered to the European Solidarity Corps participants contribute to
addressing concrete, unmet societal needs and strengthening communities and are of high quality and properly
validated.
73Part D – Quality and Support measures
SUPPORT TO LEARNING
To support, reinforce and complement the learning acquired through participation in the activities, specific quality and
support measures are foreseen: the General Online Training, language learning support, the Training and Evaluation Cycle,
mentoring and recognition of learning outcomes.
GENERAL ONLINE TRAINING
WHAT IS THE GENERAL ONLINE TRAINING?
The General Online Training is a set of training modules for the registered candidates and participants selected for an activity
provided on the EU Academy platform and accessed through the European Solidarity Corps portal. General Online Training is
a general induction with various modules that apply to participants and registrants, regardless of their status within the
European Solidarity Corps. Topics include: the mission of the European Solidarity Corps, ethics, integrity, roles and
responsibilities of the participants, European values, inter-cultural awareness, thematic training, health and safety, Youth Talks
as legacy of the European Year of Youth 2022, etc. The objective of the training is to support European Solidarity Corps
registered candidates in their engagement in quality solidarity activities and contribute to the building of the community of
the European Solidarity Corps. The training should become part of a non-formal learning process of European Solidarity Corps
participants who will be involved in specific projects and for the registered candidates in the portal not yet selected to capture
their attention and stimulate their motivation. Likewise, the General Online Training includes a Guidebook that is deemed
suitable for youth workers to both enrich the General Online Training experience and empower young people to also carry
out activities offline.
FOR WHOM?
General Online Training is available primarily to the registered candidates and participants selected for an activity. It is offered
on the EU Academy platform and accessed via the European Solidarity Corps portal.
74Part D – Quality and Support measures
LANGUAGE LEARNING SUPPORT
WHAT IS THE LANGUAGE LEARNING SUPPORT?
Language learning support is available for participants carrying out a solidarity activity in the framework of the European
Solidarity Corps. Depending on the Action, Language learning support takes the form either of a grant (150 EUR linguistic
support) or of an online course via the Online Language Support67 (OLS). The OLS is hosted on the corporate learning
management platform of the European Commission called EU Academy68. Online courses are encouraged as e-learning offers
advantages for language learning in terms of access and flexibility. OLS allows participants to assess, practise and improve
their knowledge of the language chosen. The EU Academy platform will provide features such as social networking to enable
collaborative learning as well as free language learning material. The provision of the 150 EUR linguistic support shall be based
on mutual trust between organisations who should ensure appropriate linguistic support. Other forms for support may be
offered to support the language learning needs of particular target groups. For participants in Volunteering Projects, a specific
grant (150 EUR linguistic support) for language learning support may be provided if the required language or level (in the
language of mobility) is not available in OLS yet. In such cases, the language learning must be arranged by the participating
organisations. Beneficiaries of the 150 EUR linguistic support should encourage participants to start learning the language
before their activity. Furthermore, organisations involved can use the "organisational support" budget category of the grant
to address the needs of participants in terms of pedagogical, task-related, intercultural or specific linguistic preparation (see
the "funding rules" section in Part B of this Guide).
FOR WHOM?
Participants in volunteering activities including Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas and Humanitarian Aid
Volunteering and Solidarity Projects are eligible to receive language learning support through OLS. In justified cases,
participants in Volunteering Projects may be eligible for specific financial support that is 150 EUR69.
TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE
WHAT IS THE TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE (TEC)?
One of the key features of the European Solidarity Corps is the training and evaluation it provides to participating
organisations, participants and mentors; firstly, by guiding young participants through a non-formal learning process before,
during and after their period of activity and secondly, by supporting Quality Label organisations in offering a qualitative frame
for the experience to take place. The training and evaluation dimension within the European Solidarity Corps aims at:
▪ Providing young participants with continuous guidance and support throughout their activity period. Such training
and evaluation contributes to the education and development of each young person and facilitates contacts
between young participants, participating organisations and National Agencies / SALTOs (Support, Advanced
Learning and Training Opportunities centres). It also helps resolve conflicts and prevent risks, and it provides a
means of assessing the participants' experience. The training and evaluation cycle for participants complements
other ongoing support offered by the participating organisations before and during the activity period;
▪ Providing organisations involved with the necessary support and tools to develop and carry out qualitative projects
as well as the opportunity to exchange and network with other European Solidarity Corps actors.
▪ Providing mentors with guidance on how to offer support and reinforced mentorship to the participants involved
in volunteering activities.
Quality is the main objective of preparation, training and evaluation. Given the diversity of countries, National Agencies,
organisations holding a Quality Label and participants, there is a large degree of flexibility in the training format, whereas the
quality indicators should be common to all training sessions.
What follows outlines the minimum that should be covered by a training/evaluation session. Trainers and organisers are of
course free to add any country-specific or project-specific features they deem necessary or interesting for the people
attending their training/evaluation event. The minimum quality standards clarify what can be expected to be achieved at a
training/evaluation session, whether by the organisers of the event, the project supervisors, the mentors or the participants
themselves. At the same time, regarding the training of participants, the National Agencies, regional SALTOs and the

69Only if the participant cannot receive Online Language Support due to unavailability of the required language or level.
75Part D – Quality and Support measures
participating organisations should, as far as possible, try to ensure that the training/evaluation opportunities offered to each
participant are in line with their specific needs.
Training providers can link the different training/evaluation stages while avoiding any overlaps in the content, and can thus
help create a continuous learning process for the participants before, during and following their activity period.
In addition to the Training and Evaluation Cycle, participants receive continuous counselling and guidance before, during and
after the activity period, while training for project managers, mentors and trainers adds up to a complex set of measures,
accompanying participants and participating organisations throughout the European Solidarity Corps experience.
FOR WHOM IS THE TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE?
▪ Participants: The training and evaluation cycle is for volunteers, including those volunteering in Humanitarian Aid.
Participants in Solidarity Projects can take part only in annual events.
▪ Organisations holding a Quality Label, including for Humanitarian Aid volunteering.
▪ Mentors can benefit from structured knowledge transfer and best practices, allowing that new mentors can be
trained.
TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE FOR PARTICIPANTS – HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Training and Evaluation Cycle for participants consists of the following sessions:
▪ specific training for candidate volunteers in humanitarian aid volunteering – managed by EACEA and implemented
by a contractor;
▪ pre-departure training for participants in cross-border volunteering activities – ensured by support organisations
for individual volunteering or host/support organisation for volunteering teams (for those volunteers coming from
countries other than the one where the activity takes place);
▪ on-arrival training for participants in volunteering activities of at least 2 months – ensured by National Agencies (in
case of volunteering in EU Member States or third countries associated to the Programme), SALTOs (in case of
volunteering in third countries not associated to the Programme), host or support organisations (in case of
individual volunteering activity of less than 2 months, volunteering teams and Humanitarian Aid volunteering);
▪ mid-term evaluation (only volunteering activities of 6 months and longer) – ensured by National Agencies or
SALTOs, or support and host organisations (in case of Humanitarian Aid volunteering).
In addition to the above sessions, an annual European Solidarity Corps event is foreseen for all participants taking part in
Volunteering, including Humanitarian Aid volunteering and those implementing Solidarity Projects. Volunteers have the right
and obligation to attend the pre-departure training, the on-arrival training and the mid-term evaluation sessions and the
participating organisations must ensure that their participants take part in the TEC, which is considered an integral part of the
activity. Given the different requirements of information between participants in cross-border and in-country activities or
volunteering, the training providers can tailor the content of the trainings to each target group.
SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR CANDIDATE VOLUNTEERS IN HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING
Young people wishing to participate in Humanitarian Aid Volunteering need to complete an additional specific training before being
eligible to participate. The main aim of the training for candidate volunteers in Humanitarian Aid Volunteering is to train and
prepare young people for volunteering in third countries, by ensuring that they have the necessary skills and competences to help
people in need in the most effective way. The training will address, for instance, EU external policies and general principles of
humanitarian and development aid, as well as specific behavioural competences required for volunteering in third countries.
The first part of the training is to be completed on the EU Academy platform and starts with a self-assessment, followed by an
online training of a duration of approximately 25 hours, which concludes with a test. Those who pass the test will be eligible for the
next phase, a 5-day face-to-face training in a dedicated training centres in Europe. The number of places for face-to-face training
is limited, which may lead in periods of too high demand to the temporary closure of the access to both the online and the
face-to-face training.
Candidates having completed the face-to-face training will be available in the European Solidarity Corps Portal for selection by
organisations involved in Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects.
The training is mandatory for all candidates who wish to participate in Humanitarian Aid Volunteering. It is managed by EACEA
and implemented by a contractor.
76Part D – Quality and Support measures
PRE-DEPARTURE TRAINING
In order for the project to be successful and the European Solidarity Corps experiences to be positive and enriching for the
participant, it is crucial that the support or host organisation adequately prepares the participant prior to departure. This
training is only mandatory to participants in cross-border volunteering activities. This preparation should take place at least
one month before departure and should be tailored to the individual needs of the participant and the specificities of the
project, the activity and the host country. The organisation in charge of the training is responsible for ensuring that the Info-
Kit is given to all participants involved in its project.
It is essential to provide information on "What to expect from the European Solidarity Corps" (part of the Info-Kit) — as well
as on the basics of conflict prevention and crisis management. It must provide participants with practical and technical
information on matters such as insurance, visa, pocket money and working hours, etc.
Whereas the main responsibility of organising the pre-departure training lies with the applicant organisation, the National
Agencies may organise a one-day pre-departure information session to establish contact with outgoing participants and make
sure they are prepared for their upcoming activities by the support organisations (it doesn’t apply to Humanitarian Aid
volunteers).
ON-ARRIVAL TRAINING
The main objective of the on-arrival training is to introduce the participants to the host country, preparing them for the activity
period and the European Solidarity Corps experience. On-arrival training helps the participants adapt to cultural and personal
challenges. It allows participants to get to know each other and to build a network. Participants should also receive guidance
on conflict prevention and crisis management. They should be informed about environmentally sustainable behaviour that
the Programme encourages.
At the same time, this training session equips the participants with communication skills, including aspects of intercultural
learning. It helps them become aware that cultural differences require different models of behaviour. The training is also a
good time for the participants to plan the coming months, to get to know the Youthpass concepts and process and to develop
their own personal goals for their activity period, in line with the non-formal learning philosophy of the European Solidarity
Corps.
On-arrival training for long-term cross-border and in-country participants is organised by the National Agencies or SALTOs. In
case of Humanitarian Aid volunteering, the on-arrival training by host organisation shall be in line with the minimum quality
standards detailed in the table below.
For volunteers in activities with a duration of less than two months, the host or support organisation has to organise a training
in line with the minimum quality standards detailed in the table below, although possibly with a shorter duration.
MID-TERM EVALUATION
The mid-term evaluation allows participants to assess their experience up to that point and to reflect on the activities, role
and support of the host organisation and on their own contribution. The evaluation provides the opportunity to learn from
everybody’s experience and enables the participants to plan developments and/or further improvements in their activity and
to think about what they will do in the longer term, once their experience is over. The evaluation should also raise awareness
of the personal learning process, linking it to the key competences of lifelong learning as used in Youthpass or to the setup of
Europass. Mid-term evaluation is also mandatory for in-country participants. For Humanitarian Aid volunteering, a host
organisation should organise an on-line mid-term evaluation in co-operation with support organisation.
It is essential that the event is designed as a meeting between participants. It takes place long enough after their arrival for
the participants to have gained enough experience to review their situation, but also sufficiently long before the end of the
activity period so that there is still time to improve the situation if necessary.
ANNUAL EVENTS
The European Solidarity Corps event is an opportunity to bring together former, current and potential participants in
volunteering, including Humanitarian Aid and Solidarity Project participants. The event is organised by the National Agencies
or SALTOs. It may serve as an evaluation meeting, alumni meeting and/or promotional event. It is particularly important as an
opportunity for those who have finished their solidarity activity during the past year to discuss and evaluate their experiences
and to pass them on to current and potential participants. One of the objectives of the event is to ensure that the National
Agency receives feedback about the projects, the participating organisations, the practical arrangements and the overall
impression of the participation in the activities. A key question will be what learning effect the activity period had for the
participant.

through the Online Language Support or through grants for language learning.
On-arrival training will vary according to national conditions, realities and training practices.
Nevertheless, it should ensure that each participant:
▪ is aware of and has the chance to discuss questions about visas, residence permits,
her/his legal status as a participant, insurance, the agreement under European
Solidarity Corps, and the documents in the Info-Kit;
▪ has received information about adapting to a foreign working environment, rights
and obligations, useful contacts to help with his/her settlement, etc.;

their experiences;
▪ a showcase for successful projects;
▪ a celebration of solidarity and a step towards the reinforcement of the European
Solidarity Corps community.
80Part D – Quality and Support measures
TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE FOR ORGANISATIONS – HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Training and Evaluation Cycle for organisations consists of the following:
▪ training for organisations holding the Quality Label, including for Humanitarian Aid volunteering, with emphasis on
newcomer organisations and staff;
▪ an annual event for organisations holding the Quality Label, including for Humanitarian Aid volunteering.
National Agencies are responsible for organising such trainings for all organisations holding a Quality Label in their country.
For organisations in third countries not associated to the Programme, the relevant SALTOs are the ones in charge. For
organisations involved in Humanitarian Aid volunteering, EACEA is responsible for organising such trainings. NAs/SALTOs may
decide not to organise such trainings if other instruments are in place to ensure monitoring and quality implementation.
National Agencies / SALTOs can opt to subcontract all or some of the sessions. However, the NAs/SALTOs should remain
involved in the sessions as much as possible and keep regular contact with the trainers.
Organisations holding a Quality Label are recommended to attend these sessions.
TRAINING FOR ORGANISATIONS HOLDING THE EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS QUALITY LABEL
In order for the project to be successful and the experiences to be positive and enriching for all actors involved, organisations
participating in the European Solidarity Corps which have been awarded a Quality Label need to have a thorough
understanding of the core values and features of the Corps. During the training, these organisations will focus on the elements
needed for a successful experience and reflections on how their project should be thought through and developed.
The training should:
▪ ensure understanding of each organisation's roles and responsibilities;
▪ give appropriate practical and technical information on the project management;
▪ raise awareness on the important features of the programme such as specific support for young people with fewer
opportunities, EU level recognition tools such as Youthpass and Europass, Online Language Support, role of the
mentor, etc.;
▪ provide necessary support and tools to develop and carry out qualitative mentorship;
▪ support organisations in developing qualitative projects (selection of partners and participants, development of
the tasks of the participants, crisis management, dissemination, etc.);
▪ provide networking and partner-building opportunities for organisations.
ANNUAL EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS EVENT
This yearly event should gather representatives of all European Solidarity Corps organisations holding a Quality Label with the
aim of sharing experiences, ideas and practices, showcasing success stories, and developing and reinforcing networks /
partner building. The event is also the opportunity to remind the core values and features of the programme. It will,
additionally, allow assessing the difficulties encountered by organisations and the reasons of inactivity of some Quality
Labelled organisations. This event can be combined with the Annual European Solidarity Corps event for participants.
TRAINING AND EVALUATION CYCLE FOR MENTORS – HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Training and Evaluation Cycle for mentors is optional and consists of trainings for mentors offering support and reinforced
mentoring to participants in volunteering activities.
Trainings for mentors can be physical, virtual or include blended activities.
National Agencies and regional SALTOs are responsible for organising such trainings for mentors as needed and they can opt
to subcontract all or some of the sessions. However, the NAs/SALTOs should remain involved in the sessions as much as
possible and keep regular contact with the trainers and with the mentors.
The training should:
▪ ensure understanding of mentor’s roles and responsibilities;
▪ give appropriate practical and technical information on the programme characteristics relevant for volunteers;
▪ ensure that mentors know how to guide and provide support to the volunteers in identifying the learning acquired
during their experience;
81Part D – Quality and Support measures
▪ detect wellbeing issues that are commonly encountered in the volunteering activities and support the participants
in finding help;
▪ offer guidance for reinforced mentorship for young people with fewer opportunities;
▪ provide networking opportunities for mentors.
MENTORING
MENTORING IN VOLUNTEERING ACTIVITIES
Personal support through mentoring should be provided to all participants in volunteering activities. Mentoring consists of
regular meetings between the mentor appointed by the host or support organisation and the participant, within as well as
outside the place where the activity takes place. The meetings should focus on the personal wellbeing of the participants and
should also guide and provide support to the volunteers in identifying the learning acquired during their experience.
Mentoring is targeted towards the individual participant and thus the content and frequency of the meetings will vary
according to the individual needs. Possible topics of mentoring meetings: personal wellbeing, wellbeing in the team,
satisfaction with the tasks, practicalities, etc.
REINFORCED MENTORSHIP
'Reinforced Mentorship' is an intensified mentoring process that might be necessary to support young people with fewer
opportunities, if they are not able to implement an activity independently or with normal mentoring or tutoring support. This
type of mentoring is applicable to volunteering activities. Reinforced Mentorship involves closer contact, more frequent
meetings and more time allocated to the implementation of tasks. This guarantees a step-by-step support of the participants
during project activities as well as outside working hours. Reinforced Mentorship enables the participants to gain as much
autonomy as possible, thus contributing to the successful implementation of the project.
82Part D – Quality and Support measures
RECOGNITION OF LEARNING OUTCOMES
WHAT IS RECOGNITION OF LEARNING OUTCOMES?
To support the impact of European Solidarity Corps activities on the personal, educational, social, civic and professional
development of the participants, the competences (combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes) that are the non-formal
and informal learning outcomes gained in the solidarity activities shall be identified and documented, in particular through
EU level recognition tools such as Youthpass and Europass.
FOR WHOM?
The identification and documentation of non-formal and informal learning outcomes is offered to participants (on a voluntary
basis) and participating organisations (mandatory, aif the participant requests it). This means that every young person taking
part in any European Solidarity Corps activity can benefit from a process and certificate that identifies and documents
individual learning outcomes.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
Every young person taking part in European Solidarity Corps activities is entitled to go through the Youthpass process and
receive a Youthpass certificate at the end of the process. Youthpass identifies and documents the competences developed
during the project. It is recommended to embed the educational approach of Youthpass from the start of the project and use
it during the project activities as a tool to help participants to become more aware of, reflect on and assess their learning
process and outcomes. Depending on the nature of the recognition needs and the individual solidarity activities, other tools
can also be used such as e.g. Europass.

83Part D – Quality and Support measures
INSURANCE
WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT PARTICIPANTS’ INSURANCE?
One key aspect of the activities carried out under the European Solidarity Corps is that the participant must at all time be
under a safe environment. To guarantee that the participant in volunteering activities is covered for unforeseen circumstances,
the following areas must be covered:
▪ Medical and dental care, pregnancy and childbirth, accident and hospitalisation;
▪ Life insurance (insurance against the risk of death);
▪ Permanent disability;
▪ Third party liability
(including, wherever appropriate, professional/corporate liability of participating organisations);
▪ Travel insurance.
The European Solidarity Corps supports insurance coverage, when needed:
▪ either through the insurance provided by the European Commission (for cross-border activities);
▪ reimbursement of the costs linked to insurance (for in-country activities).
FOR CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITIES
Beneficiaries must ensure that every participant in a cross-border activity is enrolled in the insurance scheme of the European
Solidarity Corps. The European Solidarity Corps insurance scheme complements the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)
71 for the coverage of necessary healthcare abroad72or, where relevant, offers primary coverage. In particular, the European
Solidarity Corps provides insurance coverage, from the moment participants leave their residence to the host country until
their return home after finishing the activity73, as following:
• Complementary coverage from the European Solidarity Corps insurance is provided to participants who are eligible
for a European Health Insurance Card.
• Primary coverage is provided to participants who are:
- not eligible for the European Health Insurance Card;
- not eligible for the European Health Insurance Card free of charge (i.e., at no cost for the participant), or those not
entitled for reason of the national regulatory framework regarding the activities they perform or their individual
situation,
- coming from or going to a country where the EU social security coordination does not apply.
Participants in cross-border activities must be in the possession of a European Health Insurance Card before arriving to the
host country. This card gives access to medically necessary, state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in any of the
EU Member States, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, under the same conditions and at the same cost (free in
some countries) as people insured in these respective countries.
Information about the coverage and support available through the insurance for participants, as well as instructions for
enrolment, is available on the website of the insurance company.
FOR IN-COUNTRY ACTIVITIES
If the participant is in need of private personal insurance given the national regulatory framework, the participating
organisations must provide the participant with personal insurance, which must offer the same coverage as the coverage for
cross-border activities, in particular coverage not related to the activity for its entire duration. Should this private insurance
be needed, the organisation may use exceptional costs to fund it.
For in-country activities, the European Commission does not define a unique format of third-party liability insurance, nor does
it recommend specific insurance companies. It is it up to project organisers to seek the most suitable insurance policy
according to the type of project carried out and to the insurance formats available at national level. It is not necessary to
subscribe to a project-specific insurance, if the participants are already covered by existing insurance policies of the project
organisers.
71 For more information about the EHIC: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=559
73 The insurance cover finishes for volunteers who after their volunteering activity decide not to return to their country of residence.
The insurance also covers follow-up medical treatments until 2 months after finishing the activity.
84Part D – Quality and Support measures
INSURANCE PROVIDED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
FOR WHOM?
Every participant in a cross-border activity must be enrolled in the insurance scheme of the European Solidarity Corps or in
the host country’s national health system. The insurance complements the coverage of the mandatory European Health
Insurance Card and/or national social security systems or covers 100% of costs incurred in specified cases.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
For activities supported under Volunteering Projects, the beneficiary organisation is responsible for the management of its
project in the IT tool provided by the European Commission for the management of projects (Beneficiary Module). The
beneficiary must encode all information about the activity the participants are involved in. The enrolment of the participants
to the insurance scheme is done automatically through the system and based on the information input there. The enrolment
to the insurance must be done before the departure of the participants; the beneficiary must therefore input the information
in the system prior to the start of the activity (usually 2 weeks in advance). The enrolment covers the duration of the activity,
including travel days. In addition, the beneficiary is responsible for keeping the information in the beneficiary module updated,
in particular the start and end dates of the activity, venue etc. as this information is linked to the insurance coverage. For
activities supported under Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas and Humanitarian Aid Volunteering related activities,
the beneficiary organisation is responsible for enrolling the participants the participants and inserting activity data (start date,
end date, location) in the IT systems provided by the European Commission or the Executive Agency. This information will be
automatically transferred to the insurance provider74.
The insurance provides complementary coverage to the European Health Insurance Card or to any other insurance
participants may have. Participants must be in possession of their European Health Insurance Card before the departure. In
certain cases, when national rules deprive volunteers from coverage under the European Health Insurance Card for the
duration of the activity or a participant comes from or to the country where the EU social security coordination does not
apply, the insurance company will provide full coverage (see above). The insurance coverage has its own exclusions and
ceilings, and it is meant to cope with urgent and necessary care which cannot wait until the end of the activity period and the
return home of the participant.
Finally, participants and organisations should bear in mind that it is a private insurance scheme. As such, it is highly
recommended to contact the insurer before incurring a medical expense, as they will be able to provide the participant with
information on whether the claim will be reimbursed, and how.
The following flow process chart explains each possible insurance coverage. It must be noted that, regardless of the activity
and type of insurance coverage, the organisation is ultimately responsible to ensure the participant is appropriately insured.
74 Further information on the procedure to follow will be provided once the project is granted.

EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS PORTAL
The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers European and national information and opportunities that are of interest to young
people wishing to engage in the solidarity sector. It provides a one-stop shop for both interested young people and
organisations wishing to join and to be part of the Corps. The Portal also allows young people to follow online trainings, get
access to other services and, importantly, to build a community of like-minded young people. To access the European
Solidarity Corps Portal, go to: https://youth.europa.eu/solidarity .
HOW DOES IT WORK?
BRINGING TOGETHER YOUNG PEOPLE AND ORGANISATIONS
Young people - at least 17 years old - wishing to engage in solidarity activities register in the European Solidarity Corps Portal.
The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers a place for those young people and organisations holding a Quality Label and
willing to implement solidarity activities to find each other. In the Portal, organisations holding a Quality Label can advertise
opportunities for volunteering activities, search for registered candidates and contact them. Registered candidates can also
look for opportunities and express their interest in them. Once the organisation and the registered candidate found each
other, the organisation sends an offer to the registered candidate.
BUILDING COMMUNITY AND PROVIDING SERVICES
The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers additional services to registered candidates. In addition to the General Online
Training on EU Academy, registered candidates can benefit from community building activities, updated information through
newsletters and other useful functionalities that are gradually being developed. Young people registered can also make use
of the mobile app, enabling them to exchange and share experiences with the other young people registered in the Corps.
They can also make a meaningful contribution to society through their engagement in the European Solidarity Network (EuSN)
or the EuroPeers network, among other networks.
87Part D – Quality and Support measures
EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS YOUTH CARD
The European Solidarity Corps Youth Card for participants of the Corps (or European Volunteer Card) is a joint initiative of the
European Commission, Directorate-General Education and Culture, the Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) and
the European Youth Card Association (EYCA), where a special European Volunteer Card is sent out to each young person
participating in the European Solidarity Corps.
The European Volunteer Card aims to:
▪ provide volunteers in the European Solidarity Corps the opportunity to enjoy all the discounts and opportunities
available through the European Youth Card scheme in order to help them participate in local activities and integrate
them into their host communities;
▪ enable volunteers to travel and explore Europe both during and after their service. The card is valid for 18 months
independent of the length of the European Solidarity Corps experience;
▪ give young people access to the information networks of the national European Youth Cards and receive quality
youth information;
▪ support the spirit of volunteering and promote volunteering in Europe;
▪ develop a European volunteer identity and feeling part of a larger group of active young people;
▪ inform volunteers about opportunities published via the European Youth Portal;
▪ support and promote a more enriching and inclusive mobility experience for European Solidarity Corps volunteers
through youth cards;
▪ contribute to the visibility of the ESC programme and a positive image of volunteering in Europe through youth
cards.
For more information on the European Volunteer Card, visit: https://eyca.org/volunteers-card.
OTHER SUPPORT MEASURES
CERTIFICATE OF PARTICIPATION
The certificate of participation is a certificate to support the visibility of the participation in volunteering activities of the
European Solidarity Corps. At the end of their volunteering experience, participants are entitled to receive a certificate of
participation, issued in the European Solidarity Corps portal provided that the activity is finalised and that participants have
submitted their participant report.
AGREEMENTS
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PROJECT PARTNERS
All participating organisations involved in a European Solidarity Corps project are strongly recommended to sign an internal
agreement between them. Such an agreement has the purpose of clearly defining responsibilities, tasks and financial
contribution for all parties involved in the activities. It is up to the participating organisations to jointly decide on how the EU
grant will be distributed and which costs it will cover.
An internal agreement constitutes a key instrument for ensuring a solid and smooth cooperation among partners in a solidarity
activity as well as to avoid or manage potential conflicts. Indicatively, it should contain at least the following information:
▪ reference of the grant agreement between the applicant participating organisation and the granting authority;
▪ names and contacts of all the participating organisations involved in the activities;
▪ role and responsibilities of each participating organisation; division of the EU grant;
▪ modalities of payments and budget transfers among participating organisations.
Although this practice is strongly recommended to safeguard the interests of each partner, such an agreement remains an
internal document among partners; it will not be requested by the granting authority.
AGREEMENTS WITH PARTICIPANTS
Prior to their departure, each young person participating in individual or team volunteering activities supported by the
European Solidarity Corps must sign a volunteering agreement using the template provided by the European Commission that
includes at least the following provisions:
88Part D – Quality and Support measures
▪ the rights and obligations of the parties to that agreement, the duration and location of deployment and a
description of the tasks involved.
▪ reference to the terms of the participants’ insurance
▪ financial contribution from the Corps;
▪ tasks to be carried out during the activity;
▪ where appropriate, reference to the relevant clearance requirements, in accordance with applicable national law.
VISAS AND RESIDENCE PERMITS
Participants in European Solidarity Corps projects may need to obtain a visa for staying abroad in the EU Member States and
third countries not associated to the Programme hosting the activity. It is a responsibility of all the participating organisations
to ensure that the authorisations required (short or long-term stay visas or residence permits) are in order before the planned
activity takes place. It is strongly recommended that the authorisations are requested from the competent authorities well in
advance, since the process may take several weeks. National Agencies and the Executive Agency may give further advice and
support concerning visas, residence permits, social security, etc. The EU Immigration Portal contains general information on
visa and residence permits, for both short-term and long-term stays:

ART NFORMATION FOR APPLICANTS
All potential applicants (including groups of young people in the case of solidarity projects assimilated here below to
‘organisations’) that intend to submit a project proposal in order to receive financial support from the EU or a Quality Label
under the European Solidarity Corps are invited to read carefully this section which is drafted in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2024
applicable to the general budget of the European Union75 (hereinafter "Financial Regulation" or “FR”).
All the contractual and financial provisions that apply to the grants awarded are presented in the model grant agreements,
which are made available for projects implemented by the Executive Agency (EACEA) in the EU Funding & Tenders Portal76
and for projects implemented by the National Agencies on the website of the relevant National Agency77. In case of
discrepancies with the information presented in this Guide, provisions of the model grant agreements prevail on those of Part
E of this Guide. Many of the steps described and information provided in this part are also relevant for organisations wishing
to apply for Quality Label.
Individuals are not entitled to submit project proposals in the framework of the European Solidarity Corps, except for
individuals applying on behalf of a group of (at least five) young people wishing to carry out a Solidarity Project (hereafter
defined as "Groups of young people").
HOW TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION?
To submit a European Solidarity Corps project application, applicants must follow the four steps described below:
1) Registration. Each applicant must be registered as follows:
a. For actions managed by the Executive Agency, applicants, affiliated entities, and associated partners must
register in the EU Funding & Tenders Portal and receive a Participant Identification Code (PIC)78.
Organisations/groups that have already obtained a PIC through their participation in other EU programmes do
not need to register again. The PIC obtained from this previous registration is valid also for applying under the
European Solidarity Corps;
b. For actions managed by National Agencies, organisations/groups of young people involved in the application
must register through the Organisation Registration system for Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps79 and
receive an Organisation ID. Organisations/groups of young people that have already obtained such an
identification code do not need to register again;
2) Check the compliance with the criteria for the relevant Action;
3) Check the financial conditions (only applicable to requests for funding, not relevant for Quality Label);
4) Fill in and submit the application form.
STEP 1: REGISTER THE ORGANISATION
Organisations/groups of young people involved in any application must be registered and provide their basic legal and financial
data in either the Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps platform for projects submitted to National Agencies or in the
Participant Register Portal for projects submitted at the Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA).
Once the registration is completed, the organisation/group will obtain an organisation ID (if applications are submitted to the
NA) and a participant identification code (PIC) (if applications are submitted to EACEA). This code, which is an identifier and
is necessary for the submission of applications, enables the organisation/group to fill-in the online application forms in a
simpler manner (i.e. by inserting the code in the form, all the information provided by the organisation/group at registration
stage will be automatically displayed in the form).
Please note that organisations/groups of young people that have already participated in an Erasmus+ and European Solidarity

ADMISSIBILITY CRITERIA
Applications must be sent no later than the deadline for submitting applications as indicated in the call.
The applications must be readable and accessible.
Applications must be complete containing all parts and mandatory annexes. Only clerical errors can be corrected after the
submission deadline upon request of the managing agency for duly justified cases.

91Part E – Information for Applicants
Submission System.
Applications are limited to 40 pages for calls for low value grants (EUR 60 000 or below); 70 pages for all other calls. Number
of pages for Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid application is limited to 40 pages. Evaluators will not consider any additional
pages.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The eligibility criteria are used to determine whether the applicant is allowed to participate in a call for proposals and to
submit a proposal for an action. They apply to the applicants and to the projects/activities for which the grant is requested:
(e.g. profile, number of participating organisations involved, type of project or/and activities, duration of the activities, profile
and/or the number of participants involved).
To be eligible, the activities and projects must meet all the eligibility criteria relating to the Action and activities under which
the proposal is submitted. If the application does not meet these criteria at application stage, it will be rejected without being
further evaluated. If it appears at implementation or final report stage that these criteria have not been fulfilled, the activities
may be considered ineligible with a consequent recovery of the EU grant initially awarded to the project.
The eligibility criteria applying to each of the Actions are described in Part B and C of the Guide.

93Part E – Information for Applicants
The facts and findings referred above shall include in particular:
(a) facts established in the context of audits or investigations carried out by EPPO, in respect of those Member
States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the Court of Auditors,
OLAF or the internal auditor, or any other check, audit or control performed under the responsibility of the

(b) non-final administrative decisions which may include disciplinary measures taken by the competent supervisory
body responsible for the verification of the application of standards of professional ethics;
(c) facts referred to in decisions of persons and entities implementing Union funds pursuant to Article 62(1), first
subparagraph, point (c);
(d) decisions of the Commission relating to the infringement of Union competition law or of a national competent
authority relating to the infringement of Union or national competition law.
The authorising officer responsible shall exclude a person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) FR where:
(a) a natural or legal person who is a member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the person
or entity referred to in Article 137(2) FR (see also above), or who has powers of representation, decision or
control with regard to that person or entity, is in one or more of the situations referred to in points (c) to (i)
above;
(b) a natural or legal person that assumes unlimited liability for the debts of the applicant referred to in
Article 135(2) is in one or more of the situations referred to in point (a) or (b) above;

more of the situations referred to in points (c) to (h) above.
In the cases referred to in Article 138(3), the authorising officer responsible may exclude a person or entity provisionally
without the recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 145 FR, where their participation in an award procedure or
their selection for implementing Union funds would constitute a serious and imminent threat to the financial interest of the
Union. In such cases, the authorising officer responsible shall immediately refer the case to the panel referred to in Article
145 FR and shall take a final decision no later than 14 days after having received the recommendation of the panel.
The authorising officer responsible, having regard, where applicable, to the recommendation of the panel referred to in Article
145, shall not exclude a person or entity referred to in Article 137(2) from participating in an award procedure or from being
selected for implementing Union funds where:
(a) the person or entity has taken remedial measures, as specified in Article 138(10) FR to an extent that is sufficient

(b) it is indispensable to ensure the continuity of service, for a limited duration and pending the adoption of remedial
measures mentioned in Article 138(7) FR;
(c) such an exclusion would be disproportionate based on the criteria referred to in Article 138(3) FR.
If the action is implemented by an applicant who has affiliated entities, they need to comply as well with the same exclusion
criteria as the lead applicant.
The authorising officer responsible shall reject from an award procedure an applicant who:
(a) is in an exclusion situation established in accordance with Article 138;
(b) has misrepresented the information required as a condition for participating in the procedure or has failed to supply
that information;
(c) was previously involved in the preparation of documents used in the award procedure where this entails a breach of

Article 139(1) FR (Declaration and evidence of absence of an exclusion situation) and on compliance with the eligibility (see
above) and selection criteria (see below).In case of proposals submitted on behalf of a consortium, the exclusion criteria
described above apply to all participating members involved in the project.
94Part E – Information for Applicants
In accordance with Articles 137(4) and 140 FR, financial penalties may be imposed on a recipient of EU funds with whom a
contract or an agreement has been entered into and who is in an exclusion situation as referred to in Article 138(1), points (c)
to (i).
Furthermore, the Commission considers that for the implementation of Actions covered by this Guide, the following
organisations are or could be in a situation of conflict of interest and therefore are or could be ineligible to participate:
▪ National Authorities in charge of supervising National Agencies and the implementation of the European Solidarity
Corps Programme in their country cannot apply or participate in any Action managed by National Agencies in any
country, but may apply for participation (as applicants or partners) in Actions managed by the Executive Agency or
by DG EAC unless that is explicitly excluded for the Action concerned (as indicated in Part B of the Guide);
▪ National Agencies (sole activity of their legal entity) or National Agencies departments of legal entities dealing with
activities outside the remit of National Agencies cannot apply or participate in any Action implemented through
this Guide;
▪ Structures and networks identified or designated in the European Solidarity Corps Regulation or in any Annual
Commission Work programme adopted for the implementation of the European Solidarity Corps for specifically
receiving a financial contribution from the Commission under the implementation of the European Solidarity Corps,
which are hosted by the legal entity that also hosts the National Agency, cannot apply or participate in any Action
managed by National Agencies in any country, but may apply for participation (as applicants or partners) in Actions
managed by the Executive Agency or by DG EAC unless that is explicitly excluded for the Action concerned (as
indicated in Part B of the Guide); they should be able to demonstrate, before being awarded a grant or a contract,
that they are not in a conflict of interest either because precautionary measures are taken by them or because
their internal organisation is such that there is a clear separation of interests. Furthermore, costs and revenues of
each action or activity for which the EU funds are awarded must be identified. The decision for admitting there is
sufficient assurance they are not in an actual conflict of interest is taken by the Executive Agency or by DG EAC,
under their own responsibility and accountability, to which they apply;
▪ Legal entities hosting the National Agencies but dealing with other activities inside or outside the remit of the
European Solidarity Corps, as well as entities affiliated to these legal entities, cannot apply or participate in any
Action managed by National Agencies in any country, but may in principle apply for participation in Actions
managed by the Executive Agency or DG EAC unless that is explicitly excluded for the Action concerned (as indicated
in Part B of the Guide). However, they have to demonstrate, before being awarded a grant or a contract, they are
not in a conflict of interest either because precautionary measures are taken by them or because their internal
organisation is such that there is a clear separation of interests. (e.g. a minimum separation of accounts, separation
of reporting and decision-making lines, measures to prevent access to privileged information). Furthermore, the
costs and revenues of each action or activity for which the EU funds are awarded must be identified. The decision
for admitting there is sufficient assurance they are not in an actual conflict of interest is taken by the Institution,
under their own responsibility and accountability, to which they apply.
EU restrictive measures
Special rules apply for certain entities (e.g. entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of the Treaty on the
European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)90). Such entities are not eligible to
participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors, or recipients of
financial support to third parties (if any).
SELECTION CRITERIA
Through the selection criteria, the National or Executive Agency assess the applicant’s financial and operational capacity to
complete the proposed project. Regardless of the requested grant amount, the relevant agency may request that the applicant
submit additional documents and information in line with the provisions below.
FINANCIAL CAPACITY
Financial capacity means that the applicant has stable and sufficient sources of funding to maintain its activity throughout the
period during which the grant is awarded and to participate in its funding.
The verification of the financial capacity will normally be done for all beneficiaries, except:
▪ natural persons in receipt of education support;
▪ public bodies, including Member States organisations;
▪ international organisations;
▪ persons or entities applying for interest rate rebates and guarantee fee subsidies where the objective of those
rebates and subsidies is to reinforce the financial capacity of a beneficiary or to generate an income;
90 Please note that the EU Official Journal contains the official list and, in case of conflict, its content prevails over that of the EU Sanctions Map
(https://www.sanctionsmap.eu).
95Part E – Information for Applicants
▪ public legal entities, institutions and organisations in the fields of education and training, youth and sport that have
received over 50% of their annual revenue from public sources over the last two years91;
▪ international organisations;
▪ if the project grant requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60 000.
In case of EU grant requests not exceeding EUR 60 000 and submitted by other types of organisations than those mentioned
above, applicants must provide a declaration on honour certifying that they have the financial capacity to implement the
project. This declaration on honour constitutes a specific section of the application form. The relevant agency may request
that the applicant submit additional documents and information.
In case of EU grant requests exceeding EUR 60 000 and submitted by other types of organisations than those mentioned
above, the applicant must submit, in addition to the declaration on honour, the following documents through the EU Funding
& Tenders Portal (Participant Register – “Financial capacity” tab / Organisation Registration System:
▪ the applicant’s profit and loss account;
▪ the balance sheet;
▪ other documents, if requested.
Where the application concerns grants for a project for which the amount exceeds 750 000 EUR, in addition to the above, an
audit report produced by an approved external auditor may be requested where available, and always in cases where a
statutory audit is required by Union or national law, certifying the accounts for up to the last three available financial years.
In all other cases, the applicant shall provide a self-declaration signed by its authorised representative certifying the validity
of its accounts for up to the last three available financial years.
For entities which cannot provide the above documents because they are newly created, an estimated financial data/ financial
declaration or an insurance declaration stating the applicant's financial risks may replace the above documents.
For Actions managed by the Executive Agency: Please also refer to the “Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment
and Financial Capacity Assessment”92.
In case of a proposal submitted on behalf of a consortium of partners, should the Executive Agency have doubts on the
financial capacity of the consortium, it should carry out a risk assessment based on which the same documents as indicated
above may be requested from the participating organisations. This is applicable regardless the granted amount.
Organisations must upload these documents on the EU Funding & Tenders Portal (Participant Register – “Financial capacity”-
tab) / Organisation Registration System either at the time of their registration (see section "Step1: Register the organisation"
above), by the deadline stipulated by the specific Action or when contacted by the EU validation services requesting the
applicant to provide the necessary supporting documents. In case of Actions managed directly by the Executive Agency, this
request will be sent via the messaging system embedded in the respective system.
If, following the analysis of the documents indicated above, the National or Executive Agency conclude that the required
financial capacity is weak, they may:
▪ ask for further information;
▪ decide to give a pre-financing covered by (one or more) a bank guarantee;
▪ decide not to give pre-financing or give a reduced pre-financing;
▪ decide to give a pre-financing paid in several instalments;
▪ require an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility for all beneficiaries or joint
and several liability of affiliated entities
If the financial capacity is insufficient, the National or Executive Agency shall reject the application.
OPERATIONAL CAPACITY
Operational capacity means that the applicant has the necessary professional competencies and qualifications to carry out
the proposed project. Applicants must have the knowledge, qualifications and resources to successfully implement the
projects and contribute their share (including sufficient experience in projects of comparable size and nature).
The authorising officer responsible may, depending on a risk assessment, waive the obligation to verify the operational
capacity of public bodies, Member State organisations or international organisations.
For Actions managed by the National Agencies, applicants must provide a declaration on honour certifying that they have
the operational capacity to implement the project. In the case of the Quality Label, the operational capacity will be assessed
according to the relevant questions of the form. In addition, if required in the application form and if the grant exceeds
EUR 60 000, applicants may be asked to submit the curriculum vitae (CVs) of the key persons involved in the project to
demonstrate their relevant professional experience or other supporting documents such as:
▪ A list of relevant publications of the main team;
91 National, European or other project grants shall not be considered public funds for the purposes of the financial capacity check.
92 https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/rules-lev-lear-fca_en.pdf
96Part E – Information for Applicants
▪ An exhaustive list of previous projects and activities performed and connected to the policy field or to this specific
Action.
In addition, applicants under the Strand “Participation of young people in solidarity activities” for Quality Label for lead
organisation must have at least one year of experience implementing activities making them eligible as applicants. Experience
preceding mergers or similar structural changes of public entities will be taken into account as relevant experience in the
meaning of this provision.
The above condition will be verified based on the application (including information about the applicant’s past participation
in the 2014-2020 Erasmus+ and/or European Solidarity Corps programme) and the documents submitted in the Organisation
Registration System. Applicants that do not complete the information requested in the application form or fail to provide
additional information requested by the National Agency in a timely manner may be rejected. The National Agency may ask
for additional supporting documents to verify the information included in the application.
For Actions managed by the Executive Agency, the operational capacity will be assessed in parallel with the ‘Quality’ award
criterion on the basis of the competence and experience of the applicants and their project teams, including operational
resources (human, technical and other) or, exceptionally, the measures proposed to obtain it by the time the task
implementation starts.
The applicants are considered to have sufficient operational capacity when the requirements referring to the operational
capacity set in the present call for proposals are met.
Applicants will have to show their capacity via the following information in the Application Form:
▪ general profiles (qualifications and experiences) of the staff responsible for managing and implementing the
project;
▪ description of the consortium composition;
▪ list of EU-funded projects for the last 4 years.
The National Agency or the Executive Agency may ask for additional supporting documents to verify the information included
in the application.
AWARD CRITERIA
The award criteria allow the National or Executive Agency to:
▪ evaluate the quality of the project/accreditation proposals submitted in light of the objectives and priorities set in
framework of the European Solidarity Corps and of the expected results;
▪ award grants/accreditations to projects which maximise the overall effectiveness of the Union funding;
▪ evaluate the grant/accreditation applications.
For Solidarity Projects and Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas, proposals that pass the individual quality thresholds and
the overall quality threshold will be considered for funding, within the limits of the available budget. The rest of the proposals
will be put on reserve list, if additional budget becomes available (where applicable), or rejected.
The award criteria applying to each of the Actions implemented through this Guide are described in Part B and C of this Guide.
STEP 3: CHECK THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
FORMS OF GRANT
The grant may take the following forms93:
▪ reimbursement of a percentage of the reimbursable costs actually incurred: e.g. the exceptional costs to cover visa
related costs;
▪ reimbursement based on unit costs, which cover certain specific categories of eligible costs which are clearly
identified in advance by reference to an amount per unit: e.g. the organisational support for volunteering projects;
This type of grant helps applicants to easily calculate the requested grant amount and facilitate a realistic financial planning
of the project. To know which type of grant is applied to each funding item under each European Solidarity Corps activity
covered by this Guide, please see the column "financing mechanism" in the "eligible costs and applicable funding rules" tables.

Corps: https://youth.europa.eu/solidarity/organisations/reference-documents-resources_en
97Part E – Information for Applicants
PRINCIPLES APPLYING TO EU GRANTS
NON-RETROACTIVITY
No EU grant may be awarded retroactively for projects already completed.
An EU grant may be awarded for a project which has already begun only where the applicant can demonstrate the need to
start the project before the grant agreement has been signed. In such cases, the costs eligible for financing must not have
been incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant application94.
If the applicant starts implementing the project before the grant agreement is signed, this is done at the risk of the applicant.
MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS
For Actions managed by the National Agencies, in case of multiple submissions of the same application by the same applicant
organisation to different Agencies, all applications will be rejected. Should almost identical or similar applications be
submitted by the same or different applicant organisations to the same or different Agencies, they will all be subject to a
specific assessment and may all be rejected.
For Actions managed by the Executive Agency, applicants may submit more than one proposal for different projects under
the same call (and be awarded a funding for them). Organisations may participate in several proposals. BUT: if there are
several proposals for very similar projects, only one proposal will be accepted and evaluated; the applicants will be asked to
withdraw the others (or it will be rejected).
Proposals may be changed and re-submitted until the deadline for submission.
ORIGINAL CONTENT AND AUTHORSHIP
All applications for projects and the Quality Label must contain original content authored by the applicant(s) or other
organisations jointly applying for a grant. No other organisations or external individuals can be paid for drafting the
application. If considering the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for the preparation of the application,
applicants should be conscious of the potential of plagiarism and should exercise careful consideration to ensure the
application’s appropriateness and accuracy, its compliance with intellectual property regulations, as well as its original
content. The National Agency may reject the applicant from the selection process or terminate an awarded project/withdraw
an awarded Quality Label at any time if it determines that these rules have not been complied with.
NON-CUMULATIVE AWARD
Each project/activity may give rise to the award of only one grant from the budget to any one beneficiary. In no circumstances
shall the same costs be financed twice by the Union budget.
To avoid the risk of double-funding, the applicant must indicate in the declaration on honour included in the application form,
whether for the same project they have received or plan to receive an EU grant, including EU operating grants.
NO-PROFIT
A grant financed from the Union budget must not have the purpose or effect of producing a profit within the framework of
the project carried out by the beneficiary. Profit is defined as surplus calculated at the payment of the balance, of receipts
over the eligible costs of the action, where receipts are limited to the Union grant and the revenue generated by that action95.
The no-profit principle does not apply to grants provided in the form of a unit cost, a lump sum or a flat-rate financing, to
actions implemented by non-profit organisations, neither to grant requests that do not exceed EUR 60 000.
Where a profit is made, the Commission shall be entitled to recover the percentage of the profit corresponding to the Union
contribution to the eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary in carrying out the action.
For the purpose of calculating the profit generated by the grant, co-financing in the form of contributions in kind will not be
taken into account.
CO-FINANCING
Grants shall involve co-financing. As a result, the resources necessary to carry out the action shall not be provided entirely by
94 Exceptionally and in accordance with the legal basis, costs may be eligible for financing if they have been incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant
application, if so, indicated in the Financing Decision.
95 To this aim, the receipts are limited to income generated by the project. The profit (or the loss) as defined above is then the difference between:
the provisionally accepted amount of the grant and the income generated by the action, and the eligible costs incurred by the beneficiary.
In addition, whenever a profit is made, it will be recovered. The National Agency or Executive Agency are entitled to recover the percentage of the profit
corresponding to the Union contribution to the eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary to carry out the action. Further clarifications on the calculation
of the profit will be provided for actions for which grants take the form of reimbursement of a specified proportion of eligible costs.
98Part E – Information for Applicants
the grant. Co-financing may be provided in the form of the project beneficiary’s own resources, income generated by the
action, or financial or in-kind contributions from third parties.
When the EU grant is provided in the form of a contribution to a unit cost - this is the case for most of the Actions covered by
this Guide - the principles of no-profit and co-funding are ensured by the Commission for the Action as a whole in advance
when it defines the rates or percentages of such units, lump sums and flat-rates. The respect of the no-profit and co-financing
principles is generally assumed and therefore, applicants do not have to justify the costs incurred by the project.
However, the payment of the grant based on the reimbursement on the basis of contribution to unit costs, lump sums, or flat-
rate financing is without prejudice to the right of access to the beneficiaries’ statutory records. Where a check or audit reveals
that the generating event has not occurred (e.g. project activities not realised as approved at application stage, participants
not taking part in the activities, etc.) and an undue payment has been made to the beneficiary on a grant based on the
reimbursement on the basis of contribution to unit costs, lump sums, or flat-rate financing, the National Agency or EACEA
shall be entitled to recover up to the amount of the grant. Similarly, if the activities undertaken or the outputs produced are
of insufficient quality, the grant may be reduced partly or in full even if the activities have taken place and are eligible.
In addition, for statistical and monitoring purposes the European Commission may carry out surveys on samples of
beneficiaries aimed at quantifying the actual costs incurred in projects funded based on the reimbursement on the basis of
contribution to unit costs, lump sums, or flat-rate financing.
COST ELIGIBILITY RULES
In order to be eligible, costs and contribution must meet the eligibility conditions set in the grant agreement and as indicated

99Part E – Information for Applicants
SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY CONDITIONS
DIRECT COSTS
The eligible direct costs for the action are those costs which with due regard to the conditions of eligibility set out above, are
identifiable as specific costs directly linked to the performance of the action, and which can therefore be booked to it directly.
In addition to the direct eligible costs that will be indicated in the call for proposals the following categories of costs are also
considered eligible:
▪ costs relating to a pre-financing guarantee lodged by the beneficiary of the grant, where that guarantee is required
by the National or Executive Agency;
▪ costs relating to certificates on the financial statements and operational verification reports where such certificates
or reports are required in support of the requests for payments by the National Agency;
▪ depreciation costs, provided they are actually incurred by the beneficiary.
The beneficiary's internal accounting and auditing procedures must permit direct reconciliation of the costs and revenue
declared in respect of the project with the corresponding accounting statements and supporting documents.
VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT)
Non-deductible and non-refundable value added tax (VAT) under the applicable national VAT legislation96 is eligible. The only
exception relates to activities or transactions in which states, regional and local government authorities and other public
bodies engage as public authorities97.
The VAT Directive does not apply to non-EU countries. Organisations from the countries that are not associated to the
programme can be exempted from taxes (including VAT), duties and charges, if an agreement has been signed between the
European Commission and the country not associated to the programme where the organisation is established.
INELIGIBLE COSTS
The following costs shall not be considered eligible:
▪ costs or contributions that do not comply with the conditions set in Part B of this Guide;
▪ costs related to return on capital and dividends paid by a beneficiary;
▪ debt and debt service charges;
▪ provisions for losses or debts;
▪ interest owed;
▪ currency exchange losses;
▪ bank costs charged by the beneficiary’s bank for transfers from the granting authority;
▪ excessive or reckless expenditure;
▪ deductible or refundable VAT, including VAT paid by public bodies acting as public authority (see above paragraph
on Value Added Tax);
▪ costs incurred or contributions for activities implemented during grant agreement suspension;
▪ in-kind contributions by third parties;
▪ costs declared by the beneficiary and covered by another project or work programme receiving an EU grant;
▪ costs or contributions declared by the beneficiary under other EU grants (or grants awarded by an EU Member
State, non-EU country or other body implementing the EU budget), except the following case:
if the action grant is combined with an operating grant running during the same period and the beneficiary can
demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any (direct or indirect) costs of the action grant;
▪ costs or contributions for staff of a national (or regional/local) administration, for activities that are part of the
administration’s normal activities (i.e. not undertaken only because of the grant);
▪ costs or contributions (especially travel and subsistence) for staff or representatives of EU institutions, bodies or
agencies;
▪ in the case of renting or leasing of equipment, the cost of any buy-out option at the end of the lease or rental
period;
▪ costs of opening and operating bank accounts (including costs of transfers from/to the National Agency charged by
the bank of the beneficiary).
96 In the Member States the VAT national legislation translates the VAT Directive 2006/112/EC.
97 See article 13(1) of the Directive.
100Part E – Information for Applicants
SOURCES OF FINANCING
The applicant must indicate in the application form the contribution from sources other than the EU grant. Co-financing may
take the form, for example, of the beneficiary's own resources or financial contributions from third parties. If, at the time of
the final report and request of payment of the balance, there is evidence that there is a surplus, please refer to sections above
on No-profit and Co-financing.
Contributions in kind from third parties are not considered as a possible source of co-financing.

101Part E – Information for Applicants
GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF GENERATIVE AI TOOLS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE PROPOSAL
When considering the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for the preparation of the proposal, it is imperative to
exercise caution and careful consideration. The AI-generated content should be thoroughly reviewed and validated by the
applicants to ensure its appropriateness and accuracy, as well as its compliance with intellectual property regulations.
Applicants are fully responsible for the content of the proposal (even those parts produced by the AI tool) and must be
transparent in disclosing which AI tools were used and how they were utilised.
Specifically, applicants are required to:
• Verify the accuracy, validity, and appropriateness of the content and any citations generated by the AI tool and correct any
errors or inconsistencies.
• Provide a list of sources used to generate content and citations, including those generated by the AI tool. Double-check
citations to ensure they are accurate and properly referenced.
• Be conscious of the potential for plagiarism where the AI tool may have reproduced substantial text from other sources.
Check the original sources to be sure you are not plagiarising someone else’s work.
• Acknowledge the limitations of the AI tool in the proposal preparation, including the potential for bias, errors, and gaps in
knowledge.
102Part E – Information for Applicants
WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE APPLICATION IS SUBMITTED?
All applications received by the National Agencies or by the Executive Agency undergo an evaluation procedure.
EVALUATION PROCEDURE
Project proposals are assessed exclusively on the basis of the criteria described in this Guide.
The National or the Executive Agency will:
▪ perform a check to verify that the admissibility, eligibility, exclusion and selection criteria are respected;
▪ evaluate the extent to which the participating organisations meet the award criteria (except in the case of grant
request under Volunteering Projects). Such quality assessment is in most cases carried out with the support of
independent experts. In their assessment, experts could be supported by guidelines developed by the European
Commission; where available, these guidelines will be made available on the websites of the European Commission
and of the Agencies responsible for the management of projects;
▪ verify that the proposal does not present risks of double funding. If necessary, such verification is carried out in
cooperation with other Agencies or other stakeholders.
The National or Executive Agency will appoint an evaluation committee to manage the whole selection process. Based on the
assessment carried out by the evaluation committee – if needed with the support of experts - will select and establish a list
of projects proposed for the grant award.
For all actions covered by this Guide, during the evaluation process, applicants may be asked to provide additional information
or to clarify the supporting documents submitted in connection with the application, provided that such information or
clarification does not substantially change the proposal. Additional information and clarifications are particularly justified in
case of obvious clerical errors made by the applicant, or in those cases where – for projects funded through multi-beneficiary
agreements – one or more mandates of the partners are missing (for multi-beneficiary agreements, see section “grant
agreement below”).
FINAL DECISION
At the end of the evaluation procedure, the National or Executive Agency decides on the projects to be granted on the basis
of:
▪ the ranking list proposed by the evaluation committee (for Solidarity Projects and Volunteering Teams in High
Priority Areas);
▪ the budget available for any given Action.
After the completion of the selection procedure, the application files and accompanying material are not sent back to the
applicant, irrespective of the outcome of the procedure.
NOTIFICATION OF RESULTS
The indicative calendar for the notification of selection results under each Action is indicated in the section "Project life-cycle
deadlines and payment modalities" below. All applicants will be informed about the evaluation result in the notification letter
on the outcome of the evaluation.
Successful applications will be invited for grant preparation; other ones will be put on the reserve list or rejected. Invitation
to grant preparation does not constitute a formal commitment for funding. The National Agency or Executive Agency will still
need to perform various legal checks before grant award: legal entity validation, financial capacity, exclusion check, etc. For
actions managed by the Executive Agency applicants will be requested to submit their organisation’s financial data and
appoint a LEAR.
If an applicant believes that the evaluation procedure was flawed, he/she can submit a complaint (following the deadlines
and procedures set out in the notification letter on the outcome of the evaluation). Complaints submitted electronically may
be subject to character limitations. For actions managed by the Executive Agency, please note that notifications which have
not been opened within 10 days after sending are considered to have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from
opening/access (see also Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions).
103Part E – Information for Applicants
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE APPLICATION IS APPROVED?
GRANT AGREEMENT
If a project is selected for an EU grant under the European Solidarity Corps, a grant agreement is signed between the National
or Executive Agency and the applicant. The applicant will receive the grant agreement to be signed and returned to the
National or Executive Agency; the National or Executive Agency is the last party to sign. When the grant is signed by both
parties, the applicant becomes beneficiary of an EU grant and can start the project100. Depending on the type of Action, grant
agreements may take the form of mono-beneficiary agreements, with the applicant being the single beneficiary, or multi-
beneficiary agreements, where all partner organisations become beneficiaries of the agreement. The multi-beneficiary
agreement is signed by the coordinator which is the only contact point for the National or Executive Agency. However, all
other organisations participating in a project (co-beneficiaries) sign an accession form to confer to the coordinator the
responsibility of acting as coordinator. The accession forms of each partner to the coordinator should be provided at
application stage. If these accession forms are provided at a later stage, they must be made available at the latest by the time
of the grant agreement signature.
The indicative calendar for the receipt of grant agreements under each Action is indicated in the section "Project life-cycle
deadlines and payment modalities" below.
GRANT AMOUNT
The acceptance of an application does not constitute a commitment to award funding equal to the amount requested by the
applicant. The funding requested may be reduced based on the specific financial rules applying to a given Action.
The award of a grant in a given round of selection does not establish an entitlement for subsequent rounds.
It should be noted that the grant amount foreseen by the agreement is a maximum which cannot be increased, even if the
beneficiary requests a higher amount. For volunteering projects, if the National Agency is the granting authority, for actions
using a unit cost-based model, the grant amount foreseen by the agreement could be increased with exceptional costs.
Funds transferred by the National Agency or the Executive Agency must be identified within the account or sub-account
indicated by the beneficiary for the payment of the grant.
For Actions managed by the Executive Agency - Reporting and Payments arrangements presented in the Model Grant
Agreement published in the Funding and Tender Opportunity Portal apply.
PAYMENT PROCEDURES
Depending on the type of Action, duration of the grant agreement and the assessment of financial risk, projects/grant requests
supported under the European Solidarity Corps are subject to different payment procedures.
Except for the first pre-financing payment, other payments or recoveries will be made on the basis of the analysis of reports
or payment requests submitted by the beneficiary (the templates of these documents will be made available in the course of
the year on the websites of National Agencies or the Executive Agency).
The payment procedures applied under the European Solidarity Corps are described below.
PRE-FINANCING PAYMENT
A pre-financing payment will be transferred to the beneficiary within 30 days of the date when the last of the two parties
signs the grant agreement, and where relevant, when any appropriate financial guarantees are received (see section "financial
guarantee" below). Pre-financing is intended to provide the beneficiary with a float. National Agencies or the Executive Agency
may decide to split the first pre-financing payment into more instalments. They may also decide to reduce the pre-financing
or not pay any pre-financing at all if the financial capacity of the beneficiary is weak.
FURTHER PRE-FINANCING PAYMENTS
Under some Actions, a second – and in some cases a third - pre-financing payment will be transferred to the beneficiary within
30 calendar days of the receipt, by the National Agency or the Executive Agency, of the further pre-financing payment requests
advanced by the beneficiary or within 60 calendar days if the further pre-financing payment request is accompanied by a
progress report. These further pre-financing payments may be requested when at least 70 % of the previous pre-financing
100 For exceptions to this rule, see section “non-retroactivity” in this part of the Guide.
104Part E – Information for Applicants
payment has been used up. Where the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment(s) shows that less than
70 % of the previous pre-financing payment(s) has been used to cover costs of the action, the amount of the new pre-financing
to be paid shall be reduced by the unused amounts of the previous pre-financing.
INTERIM (OR PROGRESS/TECHNICAL) REPORT
Under some Actions, beneficiaries may be asked to submit an interim as well as a progress/technical report informing on the
state of implementation of the activities and - in some cases - accompanying the request for a further pre-financing payment.
The interim and the progress/technical reports must be submitted by the deadline indicated in the grant agreement.
PAYMENT OR RECOVERY OF THE BALANCE
The amount of the final payment to be made to the beneficiary will be established on the basis of a final report to be submitted
by the deadline indicated in the grant agreement. If a) the events generating the grant are not implemented or are
implemented in a different way than planned; or b) the eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary are lower than those
planned at application stage, or c) the quality of the realised activities/outputs is of insufficient quality, the funding may be
reduced proportionally or, where applicable, the beneficiary will be required to repay any excess amounts already received
as pre-financing payment.
Under some Actions, in justified cases the National Agency or the Executive Agency may transfer 100 % of the grant awarded
through the pre-financing instalments. In such cases a payment of the balance is not due. However, if - on the basis of a final
report to be submitted by the beneficiary by the deadline indicated in the grant agreement - a) the events generating the
grant are not implemented or are implemented in a different way than planned; or b) the eligible costs actually incurred by
the beneficiary are lower than those planned at application stage, or c) the quality of the realised activities/outputs is of
insufficient quality, the beneficiary will be required to repay any excess amounts already received as pre-financing payment.
The final payment will be issued within 60 calendar days of the receipt of the final report.
For more information, the detailed modalities of payment applying to each Action can be found in the section "Project life-
cycle deadlines and payment modalities" below.
105Part E – Information for Applicants
PROJECT LIFE-CYCLE DEADLINES AND PAYMENT MODALITIES
Please note that the indicative dates provided in the table below are given for general information only and do not constitute a legal obligation for the National Agencies or the Executive Agency.
Similarly, as regards the payment modalities presented below, it should be noted that they will be applied in general, but depending on the individual situation of the applicant organisation (e.g.
depending on the financial capacity), different arrangements may be provided for in the grant agreement. In case of a shortage of EU appropriations for a given budget year, the first pre-financing
payment levels may be further reduced.

OTHER IMPORTANT CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS
FINANCIAL GUARANTEE
If the financial capacity is considered weak, the National Agency or the Executive Agency may require any beneficiary which
has been awarded a grant exceeding EUR 60 000 to lodge a guarantee in advance, in order to limit the financial risks connected
with the pre-financing payment. This guarantee can be requested for up to the same amount of the pre-financing payment(s).
The purpose of such guarantee is to make a bank or financial institution stand as irrevocable collateral security or first-call
guarantor of the beneficiary’s obligations deriving from the grant agreement.
This financial guarantee, in euro, shall be provided by an approved bank or financial institution established in an EU Member
State. When the beneficiary is established in a non-EU country, the National or Executive Agency may agree that a bank or
financial institution established in such country provides the guarantee, if it considers that the bank or financial institution
offers equivalent financial security and characteristics as those offered in an EU Member State.
The guarantee may be replaced by a joint third-party guarantee, or from several third-party guarantees from the participating
organisations who are parties to the same grant agreement.
The guarantee will be released after the pre-financing is gradually cleared against an interim payment or payment of the
balance to the beneficiary, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the grant agreement. In case the payment of the
balance takes the form of a recovery, either the guarantee will be released after the beneficiary is notified or will remain
explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the form of a recovery, until three months after the
debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
SUB-CONTRACTING AND AWARD OF A PROCUREMENT CONTRACT
The beneficiary may resort to subcontracting for specific technical services, which are part of the action tasks, requiring
specialised skills (relating to the legal, accounting, tax, human resources fields, IT, etc.) or implementation contracts. The costs
incurred by the beneficiary for this type of services may therefore be considered as eligible costs, provided they meet all the
other criteria described in the grant agreement.
Where implementation of the project requires the procurement of goods, works or services (implementation contract),
beneficiaries must award the contract to the economically most advantageous offer, i.e. the bid offering the best value for
money, or, as appropriate to the tender offering the lowest price, ensuring that there is no conflict of interests and that
documentation is retained in case of audit.
In the event of implementation contract exceeding a value of EUR 60 000, the National or Executive Agency may impose
special rules on the beneficiary, in addition to those referred to in the previous paragraph. Those special rules would be
published on the websites of the National Agencies or the Executive Agency.
INFORMATION ON THE GRANTS AWARDED
In line with the principle of transparency and the requirement for ex-post publicity, information on the recipients of the Union
funds must be published on the website of the Commission, the Executive Agency and/or the National Agencies during the
first half of the year following the closure of the financial year for which they were awarded.
The information may also be published in any other appropriate medium, including the Official Journal of the European Union.
The National Agencies and the Executive Agency will publish the following information:
▪ name and locality of the beneficiary;
▪ amount of grant awarded;
▪ nature and purpose of the award.
Upon a reasoned and duly substantiated request by the beneficiary, the publication shall be waived if such disclosure risks
threatening the rights and freedoms of individuals concerned as protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union or harm the commercial interests of the beneficiaries.
As far as personal data referring to natural persons are concerned, the information published shall be removed two years after
the end of the financial year in which the funds were awarded. The same shall apply to personal data indicated in the official
titles of legal persons (e.g. an association or company having as title the names of their founders).
Beneficiary organisations are not authorised to publish this type of information in relation to young people participating in
European Solidarity Corps activities.Part E – Information for Applicants
PUBLICITY
Apart from the requirements regarding the visibility of the project/activities and for the dissemination and exploitation of its
results (which are award criteria), there is an obligation of minimal publicity for each granted project.
Beneficiaries must clearly acknowledge the European Union’s support in all communications or publications, in whatever form
or whatever medium, including the Internet, or when activities for which the grant is used are implemented101.
This must be done according to the provisions included in the grant agreement. If these provisions are not fully complied with,
the beneficiary’s grant may be reduced.
CHECKS AND AUDITS
The National or Executive Agency and/or the European Commission may carry out technical and financial checks and audits
in relation to the use of the grant. They may also check the statutory records of the beneficiary for the purpose of periodic
assessments of lump sum, unit cost or flat-rate financing. The beneficiary will undertake, with the signature of its legal
representative, to provide proof that the grant has been used correctly. The European Commission, the Executive Agency, the
National Agencies and/or the European Court of Auditors, or a body mandated by them, may check the use made of the grant
at any time up to five years, or for up to three years for grants not exceeding EUR 60 000. Therefore, beneficiaries shall keep
records, original supporting documents, statistical records and other documents connected with the grant during this period.
The detailed provisions concerning checks and audits are described in the grant agreement.
DATA PROTECTION
Any personal data included in the application form or in the grant agreement/decision shall be processed by the National or
Executive Agency, or by the European Commission in accordance with:
▪ Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data by the European Union institutions and bodies and on the free movement
of such data.
▪ In secondary order and only as far as Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 does not apply – the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR or EU Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council) or the national data
protection legislation in case the GDPR does not apply (non-EU countries).
Unless marked as optional, the applicant's replies to the questions in the application form are necessary to evaluate and
further process the grant application in accordance with the European Solidarity Corps Guide. Personal data will be processed
solely for that purpose by the department or Unit responsible for the Union grant programme concerned (entity acting as
data controller). Personal data may be transferred on a need-to-know basis to third parties involved in the evaluation of
applications or in the grant management procedure, without prejudice of transfer to the bodies in charge of monitoring and
inspection tasks in accordance with European Union law or to bodies mandated to undertake evaluations of the Programme
or any of its Actions. In particular, for the purposes of safeguarding the financial interests of the Union, personal data may be
transferred to internal audit services, to the European Court of Auditors, to the Financial Irregularities Panel or to the
European Anti-Fraud Office and between authorising officers of the Commission and the executive agencies. The applicant
shall have the right of access to his/her personal data and the right to rectify any such data. Should the applicant have any
queries concerning the processing of his/her personal data, he/she shall address them to the Agency that has selected the
project. In case of conflicts; the applicant also has the right of recourse at any time to the European Data Protection Supervisor.
More information regarding the processing of personal data is included in the grant agreement.
Concerning the processing of personal data under the European Solidarity Corps, a detailed privacy statement, including
contact information, is available on the website of the Commission.

OPEN LICENCE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
An open licence is a way by which the owner of a work grants permission to everyone to use the resource. There are different
open licences according to the extent of the permissions granted or the limitations imposed, and the beneficiaries are free to
choose the specific license to apply to their work. An open licence must be associated to each resource produced.
An open licence is not a transfer of copyrights or Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Beneficiaries will remain the copyright
holders of the materials they produce and are allowed to use them as they wish. The only requirement for grant beneficiaries
is to make educational resources (or other documents and media produced by the project) freely accessible through open
licences. To fulfil this requirement, licenses need at least to grant use and, ideally, sharing and, adaptation rights. Beneficiaries
can also commercialise their project outcomes, and experience shows that open access brings visibility and may encourage
interested users to buy the printed version or physical material, document or media.Annex I – Glossary

1. Introduction
In order to receive EU funding/tenders (i.e. grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc), applicants need to fulfill a certain number of conditions
which must be checked before any funding can be awarded to them.
Some of these checks are done centrally by the EU Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register, set up in accordance with
Articles 128 and 147 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/10461 as central repository
and electronic data interchange area for participants.
This guidance sets out the rules that the Central Validation Service will use for these
checks. They currently cover:
− legal entity validation (also called ‘PIC validation’)
− LEAR appointment
− collecting the financial information for the financial capacity assessment (also
called ‘FCA’)
− ownership control assessment (also called ‘OCA’).
For these checks, the participants will be contacted directly by the Central Validation
Service and asked to submit the necessary information and supporting documents via
the Participant Register. This happens normally during preparation of the first grant,
procurement, prize or contribution agreement that successfully passed the evaluation
stage, but can also occur later during subsequent applications or in case of changes.
All data and documents will be treated as confidential.
Personal data will be handled in accordance with Regulation 2018/17252 to ensure
compliance with the principles of transparency, proportionality, impartiality and
legality. For the details, please refer to the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy
Statement (available on Portal > Legal Notices).
2. Legal entity validation
2.1. Legal entity validation and specific legal statuses: Criteria and
conditions
One of the main tasks of the Central Validation Service is the validation of new legal
entities applying for EU grants, procurements, prizes and contribution agreements.
Legal entity validation is a requirement under the Financial Regulation. It serves to
ensure that only verified entities can enter into financial relations with the EU and to
avoid legally invalid contracts.
Legal entity validation is needed only once, to get the legal entity information and

participant identification code (PIC) validated. Once validated, the participants can
enter into financial relations with the EU and use the PIC for all EU actions managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. The PIC will be valid for all ongoing application
procedures and signature in the system, but also for any type of EU funding in the
future — without having to re-register or be re-validated.
This is why the standards for PIC validation are applied consistently, independently of
the specific call/application/tender procedure that triggers the validation. The same
criteria and checks are applied for grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc, as well as for low and high value contracts.
The validation comprises two distinct actions: (a) the verification that the participant
exists as legal entity capable of entering into financial relations with the EU, including
correctness of the participant’s legal data (legal form, address, etc) and (b) the
verification of certain specific legal statuses that are used in EU funding programmes
and recorded centrally in the Participant Register.
2.1.1 Legal entity validation
‘Legal entity’ means a natural person or an entity created and recognised by law as a
legal person. It must have legal personality and, acting on its own account and in its
own name, be able to exercise rights and be subject to obligations.
Specific cases
❖ Natural persons (including self-employed persons; see below) — Are by default
considered as being legal entities. However, the Central Validation Service will refuse
validation of persons that cannot legally enter into contractual relations with the EU
(e.g. persons under age).
❖ Branches — Are not regarded as legal entities, since they do not have legal
personality distinct from that of their mother-company. The fact that they are
registered in national official registers is not relevant. It will be their mother-company
that will be considered as legal entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in
the Participant Register. The same applies to branches established in a different
country or branches of entities such as non-profit organisations, NGOs, etc.
❖ Foreign companies (company establishments which are registered with a special
status in the official register, e.g. ‘société de droit étranger’) — Will not be regarded
as legal entities, since they do not have legal personality distinct from that of their
mother-company. It will be their mother-company that will be considered as legal
entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register (the
one registered in the country of incorporation).
❖ Entities set-up within (or under) a parent organisation (such as
departments/centers/offices, without legal personality, despite having administrative
or budgetary autonomy, own VAT number/fiscal code/number of registration, etc) —
Cannot be regarded as legal entities and are considered as belonging to their parent-
organisation. It will be their parent organisation that will be considered as legal entity
for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register.
2.1.2 Exception: Validation of private entities without legal personality
By way of exception, the Financial Regulation allows for certain ‘entities without legal
personality’ to be eligible for EU grants. Such entities can therefore be validated in
the Participant Register, provided they meet the conditions set out in Article
197(2)(c) of this Regulation:
7EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on behalf
of the entity
and
− the entity offers equivalent guarantees for the protection of the EU financial
interests as a legal person, in particular equivalent financial and operational
capacity (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
This exception aims at private entities, i.e. associations or similar entities with
permanent structures (secretariat, management board, assembly, etc.) that have
their own activities, but just lack formal legal personality.
Concerning the first condition, the entity must prove its representatives' capacity to
undertake legal obligations on its behalf. This condition is not met when the
obligations are assumed on behalf of the representatives themselves or on behalf of
the owner(s) of the entity.
Concerning the second condition, the entity must prove the following elements:
− existence of patrimony/assets/capital separated and different from those of its
members/owners
and
− rules ensuring that creditors can rely on such patrimony/assets/capital and
that, in case of liquidation/insolvency, creditors are reimbursed prior to the
repartition of the patrimony/assets/capital among the owners/members (—
both conditions must be fulfilled and proved by supporting documents).
This exception only applies for participation in EU grants; entities without legal
personality cannot participate in EU tenders.
2.1.3 Exception: Validation of ministries, specialised entities of IOs and
certain EU bodies
By way of exception, the Central Validation Service will also accept the following
public entities without legal personality to be validated in the Participant Register:
− the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) (explicitly declared eligible by Articles
176(2) and 197(4) of the Financial Regulation)
− ministries, executive services which are part of the public administration of a
(central or federated) State and directly linked to the government and other
services which are part of the legislative or judicial administration, in
accordance with the official organisation of the State
− assimilated international organisations referred to in Article 156(2) of the
Financial Regulation

representatives set up by the Council of the European Union.
Departments/directorates/units/offices and other entities set up within a Ministry (or
within an executive or other service) without legal personality are considered as part
of the same Ministry (or service) and cannot be considered as independent legal

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
entities (e.g. schools, libraries, etc). They will have to use the PIC of their parent
organisation to participate in EU grants, procurements, prizes, etc.
2.1.4 Specific legal statuses
In addition, the validation covers the following specific legal statuses that are used in
certain EU funding programmes:
− private entity or public body
− non-profit or for profit organisation
− small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
− middle-capitalisation enterprise (mid-cap)
− non-governmental organisation (NGO)
− civil society organisation (CSO)
− international organisation (IO)
− research organisation
− secondary or higher education establishment.
An entity may be categorised in more than one of these legal statuses (i.e. non-profit,
public body, research organisation, international organisation, etc.).
The practical relevance of these statuses (and what happens if they change) is
established at the level of the different funding programmes, and sometimes even at
the level of the call for proposals/call for tender.
Moreover, not all of these statuses are systematically checked and validated by the
Central Validation Service. Some of them are self-declarations or self-assessments.
This means that the participants are solely responsible for the correctness of the
information they provide (in the self-declaration/self-assessment).
The Central Validation Service may however — at any time — carry out checks on
self-declared/self-assessed statuses against supporting documents and ask for
clarifications.
In case of false declarations, the EU services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status(es)
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements,
etc.; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
Private entity or public body
'Private entity' means an entity established under private law.
‘Public body’ means an entity established as a public body by national law, or an
9EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
international organisation.
‘Established as a public body by national law’ means:
− incorporated as a public body in the act of creation or recognised as a public
body by national law
and
− governed by public law (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
Criteria such as:
− mission or activity in the general interest (public service mission)
− the fact that the shares are owned by a public body (even if ownership reaches
up to 100% of the share capital)
− public financing
− state supervision and control
do NOT constitute sufficient evidence to qualify an entity as a public body, if the
above two conditions are not met.
Public bodies may however act and be subject to private law for some or most of their
activities, provided that, concerning their existence and their functioning, they are
subject to public law.
The two statuses (private entity and public body) are mutually exclusive, meaning
that you can only be validated as one or the other.
They are systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the
Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Self-employed persons (persons who perform an activity independently and with
their own means, such as craftsmen and individuals exercising liberal, industrial and
commercial professions) — Are regarded as ‘natural persons’, not as ‘private entities’;
the business/profession/activity they perform is not provided with independent legal
personality different from that of the person.
❖ Private law bodies with a public service mission3 — A legal entity
incorporated under private law/private legal form is not considered to be a public
body even if owned by the State/other public bodies and/or pursuing a public service
mission.
Non-profit
‘Non-profit entity’ means an entity that is non-profit making by its legal form or legal
purpose (e.g. charitable organisations), or that has a legal or statutory obligation not
to distribute profits to its shareholders or members.
All profits have to be reinvested in the same activity of the entity.
3 Article 62(1)(c)(vi) of Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
10EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Decisions on (not) distributing profits made by the managing board, associates,
stakeholders, members, or representatives and/or practices adopted by the entity to
not distribute profits and/or the absence of profits achieved are not sufficient proof of
the non-profit nature. The obligation not to distribute profits and/or the impossibility
to distribute profits must be based on law and/or the act of establishment/articles of
association/statutes, etc.
Whether the owners/founders of the entity are non-profit and whether the profits are
allocated to non-profit (or for profit) entities is irrelevant.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Public bodies — Are in principle regarded as non-profit by default.
❖ Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) — The classification as ‘non-
governmental organisation (NGO)’ is not relevant for the non-profit status, since in
most countries NGO is not a recognized legal form. By contrast, non-profit status is a
prerequisite for the self-declaration as NGO (see below).
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
‘Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)’ means a micro, small or medium-sized
enterprise as defined in the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361, i.e.:
− engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form (including, in
particular, self-employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or
other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an
economic activity)
and
− employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as
defined in Article 5 of the SME Recommendation) and which have an annual
turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and/or an annual balance sheet total
not exceeding EUR 43 million.4
An entity is considered to be engaged in an ‘economic activity’, if it proves to be
involved in any form of trade or activity done for remuneration or pecuniary interest
on the market. Thus, in general, any activity consisting in (directly or indirectly)
offering goods or services on a given market is an economic activity.
The following will NOT be considered economic activities:
− activities which do not entail (directly or indirectly) some sort of pecuniary
offset or
− activities for which there is no given/direct (or indirect) market or
− activities for which the income generated is not distinct from the personal
income of the entity’s members or shareholders.
4 The SME ceilings must be calculated by including the headcount of staff, the balance sheet total and the
turnover data of all relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361.
11EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
This status is self-declared. For calls where the SME status has an impact on eligibility
or funding (higher funding rate, etc), participants must go through a self-assessment
wizard.
Two-year rule — In accordance with Article 4.2 of the SME Recommendation, the SME
status depends on the ceilings for two consecutive accounting periods. Headcount and
turnover must stay below the ceilings for two accounting periods to obtain the SME
status; conversely, the status will be lost if they rise above the ceilings for two
consecutive periods.
Since the SME self-assessment looks at the information for only one accounting
period (the last one), the SME self-assessment result may be flawed. Participants that
were below the ceiling the year before, must contact the Central Validation Service
via the Participant Register in order to request a formal validation. This validation will
then take into account the two accounting periods.
The two-year rule does not apply for changes due to a merger or acquisition.
Enterprises that are subject to a change in ownership need to be assessed on the
basis of their shareholder structure at the time of the transaction. If the aggregated
headcount and financial data of the new structure exceed the SME ceilings, the SME
status is lost immediately from the date of the transaction5.
Participants whose SME status changes after registration must update their data in
the Participant Register. This is important not only for eligibility checks in grant
applications, but also for statistical purposes.
Specific cases
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that do not yet have
closed accounts or companies without economic activity but expecting to enter
soon into the market — May also qualify as SMEs, as long as they are able to provide
a ‘bona fide estimate’ (in the form of a business plan) covering the period necessary
for the entity to generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long time-to market
— Are allowed to demonstrate that they are engaged in an economic activity by
showing the investments made and the likely expected return.
Middle-capitalisation enterprise (Mid-cap)
'Middle-capitalisation enterprise’ means an enterprise that is:
− not a micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under the EU SME
Recommendation 2003/361
and
− employing up to 3 000 persons6 , where the headcount of staff, including all
relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises, is calculated in
accordance with Article 3 to 6 of the Annex to the Recommendation.
This status is self-declared. For calls where the mid-cap status has an impact on
eligibility or funding (higher funding rate, etc.), participants must go through the SME
5 See Recital 9 of Recommendation No, 2003/361/EC and the User Guide to the SME Definition (p. 14).
6 Expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Annex of EU recommendation
2003/361.
12EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
self-assessment wizard to make sure that they do not fall under the definition of SME,
and then to self-declare that the number of employees does not exceed 3 000
persons.
Non-governmental organisation (NGO)
‘Non-governmental organisations’ are organisations which are voluntary, independent
from government and non-profit, and which are not a political party or trade union.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by private entities,
which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Civil society organisation (CSO)
‘Civil society organisations’ are organisations from the ‘third sector’ of society, distinct
from government and business (i.e. private for profit entities).
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will normally be accepted only by private
entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
International organisation (IO)
‘International organisation’ means an intergovernmental organisation (other than the
EU) established under international public law, including specialised entities — with or
without legal personality — set up by international organisations.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
For some EU funding programmes there are moreover specific subtypes of
international organisations:
− ‘international organisations of European interest for H2020 (H2020 IOEI)’, i.e.
international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member
States or H2020 associated countries and whose main objective is promoting
scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international European research organisations for Horizon Europe (HE IERO)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries and whose main
objective is promoting scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international organisations of European interest for Digital Europe (DEP IOEI)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or whose headquarters are in an EU Member State.
The H2020 IOEI subtype status is systematically checked against supporting
documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.
The HE IERO and DEP IOEI subtype statuses are self-declared. In the future, for calls
where the HE IERO and DEP IOEI statuses have an impact on eligibility or funding,
participants will also be asked to go through a self-assessment wizard.
Specific cases
❖ Entities set up as distinct bodies by an international organisation with a
special mission but which do not have explicit legal personality — Can be validated
as with legal personality, if they meet any of the following criteria:
− they have treaty-making capacity or
13EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− they have capacity to act at international level independently from the
organisation that set them up (i.e. capacity to undertake legal obligations).
If such entities do not meet one of the above criteria, they can exceptionally be
validated as without legal personality (see section 2.1.3 above).
Research organisation
‘Research organisation’ means an entity that:
− is established as non-profit organisation as described above
and
− carries out research and/or technological development as its main objective.
The following are NOT considered research activities:
− supporting or financing research activities carried out by other entities
− promoting, managing or coordinating research activities.
Only entities that have research and/or development as their main objective can
qualify as research organisations. By contrast, entities that have research and/or
development as ancillary activities (even if regular and substantial, e.g. in museums
or hospitals) do not qualify as ‘research organisations’.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by entities, which
have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Secondary or higher education establishment
‘Secondary or higher education establishment’ means an entity that is recognised as
such by its national education system and is able to deliver diplomas recognised by
the State.
It can be a public body or a private entity (see above). The national accreditation as a
secondary/higher education establishment is not sufficient to consider the entity as a
public body.
This status is self-declared.
2.2 Documents and information to provide
2.2.1 General requirements and principles
The legal validation of entities is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participants as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
by the participants on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (can be
required by the EU services at any time).
In principle only official documents are accepted. Documents are considered as official
when they are delivered by official national authorities. Official documents can NOT be
replaced by self-declarations or by sworn or solemn statements before judicial or
administrative authorities, notaries or public officers.
As a general rule, documents are accepted in any of the EU official languages.
Participants may however be requested to submit an English free (unofficial)
translation to facilitate the validation process. Documents in non-EU languages will be
accepted only if accompanied by a free translation in English (and in case of doubt, a
14EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
certified/legal translation in English may be requested). Free translations should
always be accompanied by the copies of the original official documents.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as for any information provided by other means
(e.g. by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
2.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Signed legal entity identification form7:
− Natural Person Form: in English
− Private Legal Entity Form: in English
− Public Legal Entity Form: in English.
2. Official VAT document or — if the entity is not registered for VAT — the proof of
VAT exemption, not older than one (1) year.
For the specific legal statuses, participants will be asked to submit the following
additional documents:
Status Documents to be submitted
Private entity A valid registration extract not older than one (1) year.
Documents older than one year may be accepted if valid for a
(including SME and mid-cap)
certain period of time expressly indicated in the same
document (e.g. valid for two years) and if submitted via the
Participant Register within this period of time.
Public body Copy of the act, law, decree or decision that established the
entity as a public body (or, if this does not exist, any other
official legal document that proves this).
Natural person Integral copy (legible) of valid identity card or passport (e.g. in
case of identity card, both sides must be provided).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Entities without legal personality Copy of an official document attesting that the representatives
of the entity have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on
its behalf.
Copy of an official document attesting that the entity has the
same operational and financial viability as that of a legal entity:
i.e.
1. a document showing patrimony/assets/capital that
are separated and different from those of the
members/owners of the entity, and
2. a copy of the rules providing that creditors can rely
on this patrimony/assets/capital and — in case of
liquidation/insolvency — are reimbursed before the
patrimony/assets/capital are divided between the
owners/members.
Non-profit Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is non-
profit by its legal form or by its legal purpose, or that it has a
legal or statutory obligation not to distribute profits to
shareholders or individual members.
The certificate of tax exemption is only an indication of the
non-profit status and will therefore be assessed together with
other elements.
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME) The following documents must be provided for the participant
and mid-caps and for its linked and partner entities (in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation
(— if expressly requested by the Central
2003/361):
Validation Service)
1. graph showing the complete ownership structure,
including all direct and indirect shareholders
2. proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners
and their respective percentage of interest and voting
rights
3. approved financial statements for the most recent
closed accounting period, including:
− balance sheet statement
− profit and loss account, clearly indicating the
amount of annual turnover from sales of goods
and services
− annexes to these documents and/or
accompanying notes, indicating (i) staff head
count and (ii) any equity participations in other
companies/downstream organisations with
exact percentage of the shares and voting rights
held. If the annexes/notes to the financial
statements do not contain the requested
information, other documents can be provided
that contain equivalent data (such as headcount
reports for social security purposes, extracts from
HR records certifying headcount, etc); in
exceptional cases, self-declarations can be
accepted
4. documents explaining the mechanisms of ownership
and control, corporate governance and decision-
making rules (e.g. statutes/articles of association and
shareholders’ agreements; memorandum of
16EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
understanding among shareholders, internal corporate
governance rules, etc)
Sworn or solemn statements before a judicial or
administrative authority, notary or public officer cannot replace
the above listed documents as proof of the SME or mid-cap
status.
The following documents must be submitted in the below
specific cases:
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that
do not yet have closed accounts — Instead of approved
financial statements, a self-declaration must be provided,
including a bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan)
for the entire period (financial years) necessary for the entity to
generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long
time-to market — In addition to the approved financial
statements, a self-declaration must be provided, including a
bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan) for the
entire period (financial years) necessary to generate turnover,
including a declaration of the investment made and the likely
expected return (to demonstrate that, despite the lack of
turnover, the enterprise is engaged in an economic activity).
❖ Entities owned directly or indirectly by natural persons —
Self-declaration on the natural person(s) engagement in
economic activity and possible participations in other entities
must be provided. The template for the self-declaration will be
provided to participants during the validation process if specific
cases of ownership by natural persons are identified.
International organisation Copy of the international treaty creating the organisation under
international public law.
Research organisation Copy of an official document attesting research or technological
development as the main objective of the entity.
(— if expressly requested by the Central
Validation Service)
Secondary or higher education Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is
establishment recognised as ‘secondary or higher education establishment’ by
the national education system and is entitled to deliver
(— if expressly requested by the Central
diplomas recognized by the State.
Validation Service)
For other categories such as NGO, Civil Society Organisation, etc no supporting
documents are needed (unless exceptionally requested by the Central Validation
Service).
2.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
17EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− the documents submitted are outdated (e.g. VAT document or extract of
registration no longer valid or more than one (1) year old)
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the validation (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
2.3 Validation and effective date
On the basis of the submitted information and documents, the participant will be
validated with the effective date of entry into force of the legal act establishing its
constitution or incorporation (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
That date will be, in order of precedence:
1. the date of registration in the country's’official registry (e.g. commercial
registry)
2. the date of publication in the national official journal
3. the date of the legal deposit of the act in the court registry
4. the date of signature of the parties.
When there is no act of constitution or incorporation, the participant will be
considered to exist since a standard default date.
The effective date for the SME and mid-cap status will be the accounts closure date of
the accounting period on which the assessment is based in accordance with Article
4(2) of the Annex of the SME Recommendation 2003/361. For newly established
enterprises that do not yet have closed accounts, the effective date is the date of
their creation.
The effective date of other specific legal statuses is the date in which the specific
status enters into force. This date may be the same as its effective date of
constitution or incorporation (or may differ, if the specific status has been acquired
later on).
2.4 Modification of validations
Modifications in the validation can be made in the following cases:
− following a request submitted by the participant to update the validation (e.g.
in case of changes in the participant’s legal situation such as change of
identity/legal form, name, address, status) or
− after checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out by the EU services
which necessitate a correction.
2.4.1 Validation updates
In case of a change in the participant’s legal situation (identity/legal form, name,
address, status, etc), the participant must request an update of the validation.
18EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Requests to update a validation will be accepted, if submitted by the participant’s
LEAR and accompanied by the relevant supporting documents. If no LEAR has
been appointed yet in the Participant Register, requests for modification should be
submitted after the LEAR appointment has been validated.
The ‘effective date of the change’ will be the date on which the act establishing the
change enters into force (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
For SMEs and mid-caps, the effective date is the closure date of the accounting period
on which the change of status is based. For cases of mergers and acquisitions that
lead to the loss of the SME or mid-cap status, the effective date of change will be the
date when the ownership structure changed.
The impact and practical consequences of the changes depend on each funding
programme.
2.4.2 Corrections of validations
If a validation turns out to beincorrect (through an audit, ex-post check, investigation
or other means), it will be corrected by the Central Validation Service. The correction
will be registered with effect back to the effective date of the initial validation.
If the error is attributable to the Central Validation Service and its correction implies
disadvantages for the participant, the retroactive effect may exceptionally be waived,
if duly justified and in line with the principles of sound financial management and
proportionality.
If the error was the fault of the participant (intentional or unintentional), its
participation in on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc
may be terminated and undue amounts paid may be recovered. Moreover, the
participant may be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements,
prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial
Regulation). In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
2.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If they find out that a participant did not meet the criteria for being validated or for
being validated with a specific legal status (e.g. due to false declarations), the
modification of the validation will be registered with retroactive effect back to the
effective date of the validation.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc, their participation may be terminated/withdrawn and
undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.

3. Validation of the LEAR appointment
3.1 Validation of the LEAR appointment: General requirements and principles
In parallel with the legal entity validation, the Central Validation Service will contact
the participants to appoint their Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR), i.e.
the single point of contact needed for the Participant Register and Funding & Tenders
Portal electronic exchange system.
The appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register is mandatory for all
validated participants. Without LEAR it will NOT be possible to update the legal entity
data in the Participant Register, nor sign contracts electronically in the Funding &
Tenders Portal.
3.1.1 Role of the LEAR
The LEAR is the person officially appointed by the participant to handle their access
rights and key data in the Participant Register (legal and other data, certain access
rights in the electronic exchange system, etc.).
Once validated, it is the LEAR who is responsible for giving access rights to the Portal
electronic exchange system and who must ensure that the participant’s legal
information is always up to date.
The LEAR must enter and update on the ‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen the names
of the:
− legal representatives and signatories for the organisation (so-called ‘LSIGNs’);
these are people who are able to commit the organisation legally by signing
contracts and authorising amendments to them and
− persons that may sign cost statements on behalf of the organisation (so-called
‘FSIGNs’).
If needed, the LEARs can delegate their tasks to one or more colleagues, who will act
as account administrators (so-called ‘AccAds’; delegation also through the
‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen).
In case of changes, the LEAR must encode the change in the Participant Register and,
if needed, request validation and provide supporting documents.
For a detailed description of the LEAR rights and responsibilities, see the LEAR
appointment letter*.
3.1.2 Position of the LEAR
The LEAR is an administrative function that may be held by the participant’s legal
representative or another key person within the entity.
The LEAR must be someone employed in the entity (most commonly in the central
administrative services of the entity) and should be able to ensure the stability and
continuity that is needed to fulfil this role in order to honour the participant’s
contractual obligations.
Participants that are natural persons will automatically have the role of LEAR; in this
case the role cannot be attributed to a different person (but the LEAR can appoint an
account administrator).
20EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Each participant can only appoint one LEAR and must ensure to immediately replace
their LEAR in case they are no longer able to exercise the role (e.g. job change,
dismissal, death, etc; see section 3.3).
The participant assumes the full responsibility for the choice of the person they
appoint as LEAR.
3.1.3 Legal representative
The LEAR must be appointed by the participant’s legal representative. The legal
representative is a person duly authorised to act on behalf of the entity and to
commit it in its entirety vis-à-vis third parties.
Specific cases
❖ Persons tasked with the daily management — Can not be recognized as legal
representatives if they are not entitled to engage and represent the entity outside
ordinary day-to-day business matters.
The ‘daily management’ (‘gestion journalière’) is commonly understood as comprising
those acts that, because of their minor importance or the need for a prompt solution,
do not justify the intervention of the management bodies. It consists of ordinary
business and execution of day-to-day decisions and in line with the general
instructions of the management board.
❖ Limitations — Similarly, persons empowered to engage and commit the
participant only within certain limits (including financial limits) can not be accepted as
legal representatives for the purposes of the LEAR appointment.
3.1.4 Timing of the LEAR appointment
The process for appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register can run in parallel
to the validation of the entity, but can only be finalised once the participant (PIC) is
validated.
LEAR appointment is not a condition for the submission of a proposal/tender in the
Funding & Tenders Portal, but its validation must be completed before the the grant,
procurement or contribution agreement can be signed.
3.2 List of documents and information
For the validation of the LEAR appointment, the scanned version of the following
documents must be uploaded by the participant in the Participant Register:
1. LEAR appointment letter* (specifying the LEAR roles & duties and including the
declaration of consent to the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and
Conditions*), completed, dated and signed by the legal representative and the
LEAR
2. Integral copy of an official, valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport, with
photo and signature) of:
− the legal representative and
− the appointed representative (LEAR)
3. Document(s) proving that the legal representative(s) appointing the LEAR is
empowered as such, which must:
21EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− clearly indicate the role/function within the organisation as legal
representative
− identify and appoint this person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
The originals must be kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which
can be required by the EU services at any time). They must not be sent to the Central
Validation Service.
After receiving the above-listed documents (and after the PIC has been validated),
the LEAR appointment will be validated in the Participant Register.
For a detailed description of the LEAR appointment process, see the Online Manual*
and the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions*.
Proof of identity
‘Identity documents’ are those issued by national authorities and recognized by
national law as valid proof of identity. Identity documents can not be replaced by any
other means of proof. The EU services cannot waive this requirement under any
circumstances.
Examples of identity documents accepted are ID cards and passports. Driving licenses
are also accepted, as long as they are considered as valid proof of identity under the
applicable national law of the entity concerned.
Identity documents must be valid (not expired) at the time of the LEAR appointment.
An integral copy of the document must be provided (e.g. in most countries both sides
of the identity card must be provided).
Identity documents in which some parts/elements, including the photo, have been
deleted/erased/covered (e.g. with black marker) cannot be accepted.
Specific cases
❖ Service cards and badges issued by the participant — Cannot replace identity
documents (even if the participant is a public body) and therefore cannot be accepted
as proof of identity.
❖ Print-outs from the ID electronic chip — Cannot be accepted either.
Signatures
The LEAR documents must be signed by persons who are legal representatives of the
participant.
The names of both legal representative and LEAR in the LEAR documents must
correspond to those indicated in their official identity documents. LEAR documents
signed with acronyms/nick names/etc that do not correspond to the names indicated
in the identity documents will not be accepted.
Signatures can be either handwritten signatures or qualified electronic signatures
22EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
within the meaning of Article 3(12) of Regulation 910/20148. For the latter, the
Central Validation Service will verify that the signature is based on a valid qualified
certificate and was created by a secure creation device. See here for the list of
accepted trust service providers: eIDAS Dashboard (europa.eu).
Specific cases
❖ Internal requirements (e.g. joint signature of more than one person required to
legally engage the entity, foreseen by law, act of establishment, statutes, internal
rules, etc) — In case of internal requirements, the participant is fully responsible for
ensuring compliance (e.g. through an internal process ensuring that the single
signature on the LEAR documents is made only after all the internal requirements on
joint signature are fulfilled).
❖ Limitations — The Central Validation Service will take into account limitations to
represent the entity only if these limitations are explicitly mentioned in the
documents submitted to prove the empowerment of the legal representative (e.g.
limitation in the excerpts of the company registry).
Documents proving the empowerment of the legal representative
The document(s) proving the empowerment must identify:
− the role/function of legal representative within the entity
− the name and appointment of the person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
This can be found in a single document (in case the official appointment also specifies
the powers/tasks related to the appointment) or in several documents combined (e.g.
the official act of appointment and the organisational document, such as act of
establishment, statutes, articles of association, etc, in which the powers/tasks related
to the role are identified).
The documents must be valid (not expired) at the time when the LEAR is appointed.
The documents proving the appointment of the legal representative are those
required/accepted under the applicable national law of the entity concerned. They
may vary depending on the country, the legal form and status:
− law/decree/official act/official gazette in case of public entities
− copy of the treaty in case of international organisations
− decision of assembly, official documents from the council of administration,
executive committee or directors board, excerpts of the company registry in
case of private entities.
A declaration of honour can be accepted only in exceptional, duly justified cases
where none of the above exists.
Concerning the language of such documents and participant's responsibilities
concerning translations, see section 2.2.1.
8 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on
electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 257,
28.8.2014, p. 73).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Specific cases
❖ Participants who are natural persons — Do not need to prove their
empowerment, but still need to send the supporting documents listed above. The
documents should be signed by the natural person alone. A copy of the ID documents
of the natural person must also be included.
❖ Deputising persons — In case of temporary absence of the legal
representative(s) or their impossibility to sign, other persons empowered to act as
legal representatives (i.e. deputising persons) are accepted as legal representatives
by default. The reason for the temporary absence/impossibility and the legitimation of
the deputy will not be checked by the Central Validation Service and therefore
remains under the full responsibility of the participant (see also above under ‘internal
requirements’).
❖ Ministries — For ministries, Ministers are considered legal representatives by
default and there is no need to provide the legal documents proving their
empowerment.
In addition to the Minister's role, the following roles/functions are considered as legal
representatives by default, without any further verification of the legal documents
proving their empowerment:
− Deputy Minister
− State/General Secretary and their deputies
− Directors of certain specific horizontal sectors/departments/directions, namely
'legal', 'financial','European or international relationships'.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the ministry, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website of the ministry).
Except if otherwise provided in the applicable rules (law/decree/act governing the
organisation of the ministry), other roles such as ‘Director’/‘Had of Department’/‘Head
of Unit’, etc will be considered as having limited tasks and powers (relating only to
the directorate/department/unit’s policies) and, therefore, not entitled to represent
and engage the ministry as a whole.
For Ministers, the ID document can be exceptionally replaced by a badge or service
card (issued by the ministry). This exception applies only to the person of the
‘Minister’ and cannot be extended to other representatives (such as State Secretaries,
Deputy Ministers or Directors/Head of Departments); these persons are not exempted
from the obligation to provide an ID document.
❖ Public bodies and governmental entities — For public bodies and other
state/governmental entities, including executive services at central/regional/local
level, the highest-ranked person (e.g. Director-General, President, Mayor, etc) will be
recognized as legal representative by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the entity, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website).
❖ International organisations — For international organisations, the highest-
ranked person (e.g. Secretary, Secretary-General) will be recognised as legal
representative by default.
24EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the international organisation, the
evidence may also be taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the
organisational chart published on the official website of the international
organisation).
❖ Universities and higher education establishments — For universities and
other higher education establishments (e.g. colleges, institutes, etc), the following
roles/functions are recognised as legal representative by default, without any further
verification of their powers:
− Rector and Vice-Rector
− President and Vice-President
− Chancellor and Vice Chancellor.
In case of faculties with their own legal personality (and thus independently
validated), the Dean and Vice-Dean can also act as legal representatives by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the university/higher education
establishment/faculty, the evidence may also be taken from other appropriate
sources (e.g. the organisational chart published on the official internet-site of the
university/faculty).
3.3 LEAR replacement
A LEAR replacement is equivalent to a new LEAR appointment. For the replacement of
an already validated LEAR, participants must submit the same type of documents and
the Central Validation Service will follow the procedure for the validation of LEAR
appointment (see above).
3.4 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant did not respect the obligation to keep the original
documents or committed other irregularities, appropriate measures will be taken.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, or
contribution agreements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts
paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
4. Financial capacity assessment
4.1 Financial capacity assessment: Criteria and conditions
In addition to the legal entity validation and LEAR appointment, the Central Validation
Service also assists the EU services with the financial capacity assessment (required
by the Financial Regulation for grants and procurements; not needed for prizes or
contribution agreements).
25EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The financial capacity assessment must in principle be done for each new
application/tender (— unless the participant already has a valid financial capacity
assessment performed by the Central Validation Service that is not older than 18
months).
Additional conditions depend on the type of procedure (grant or procurement),
participant and grant amount (e.g. no financial capacity assessment is needed for
public bodies in grant procedures, for Member State organisations, international
organisations, persons in receipt of education support, persons most in need and in
receipt of direct support; for low-value grants and low-value procurements).
Additional exemptions are provided in some programmes for specific situations or
types of participants.
Moreover, the financial capacity may be assessed ad hoc if there are justified grounds
to doubt it, like for example:
− indication of weak/insufficient financial capacity from other sources
− involvement in cases of serious administrative errors or fraud
− pending legal procedures or judicial proceedings for serious administrative
errors or fraud
− attachment order or recovery order for an outstanding amount issued by an
EU body on which the payment is significantly overdue
− substantial findings in EU audits within the last 2 years that put in doubt the
financial capacity.
The financial capacity is assessed on the basis of financial indicators that are in
principle the same for all EU programmes.
The financial capacity assessment is normally done during grant preparation/tender
evaluation but may also be done during implementation. If a participants’ financial
capacity must be assessed, they will be contacted by the Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The role of the Central Validation Service is to prepare the financial capacity
assessment (e.g. to collect and to analyse the financial documents). The final decision
on the financial capacity will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender separately
by the EU service in charge.
4.2 Documents and information to provide
4.2.1 General requirements and principles
The financial assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the EU
services at any time).
As a general rule, financial documents must be provided in their original language(s),
as imposed by the legislation in the participant’s country of registration. For
documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit an English free
(unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in non-EU
languages, a free translation in English is always mandatory and needs to be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
26EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
Some examples of such documents are: dated and signed annual management
reports in English for a company listed on the stock exchange or having international
shareholders or for the purpose of consolidation within a foreign group; dated and
signed extracts from national registers that use English, etc.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as any information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw or correct the financial assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
4.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Profit and loss account — approved by the management of the entity, clearly
indicating the amounts of turnover from sales of goods and services, operating
income, staff, depreciation, amortization costs, net operating result and
interest expenses. If this information is not indicated in the profit and loss
account or in the explanatory notes it must be provided in the form of a self-
declaration.
2. Balance sheet statement — approved by the management, clearly indicating
the nature and the maturity (i.e. below or above one year) of receivables and
other current assets, grants, provisions and debts. If this information is not
indicated in the balance sheet or in the explanatory notes it must be provided
in the form of a self-declaration.
3. Explanatory notes and/or annexes that form part of the above financial
statements (if available).
4. External audit report or self-declaration
Participants requesting a grant amount of above 750 000 EUR (for action
grants) or above 100 000 EUR (for operating grants) must provide:
− an statutory audit report issued by an approved/certified external
auditor if:
− such a report is available or
− a statutory audit is required under EU or national law
or
27EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− a declaration on the validity of the accounts* (self-declaration), signed
by the legal representative of the entity, which certifies the validity of
the accounts.
The documents provided must cover the last two closed financial years. The most
recent year must have been closed within the last 18 months.
Exceptions are allowed for:
− start-up companies without closed annual accounts which provide
prospective data (business plan) for one year only
− recently created entities which have closed annual accounts for one year
only. These entities will be assessed based on the documents for the sole
closed financial year
A single financial document containing comparative data of the annual accounts of
both years under assessment will be accepted. The same applies to an external audit
report covering the two financial years.
If some (or all) of the documents have already been provided for the financial years
in question (i.e. uploaded in the Participant Register), the participant does not need
to submit them again.
The audit report must include:
− the clear mandate and scope of the audit
− the responsibilities of the management and the auditor
− the way in which the audit is carried out
− the auditor’s opinion, including a reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
All documents must be provided simultaneously (profit and loss account, balance
sheet, audit report/self-declaration, etc).
No audit report/self-declaration is needed for entities participating in tender
procedures, for natural persons and entities without closed accounts.
Specific cases
❖ Subsidiaries without own financial statements — Subsidiaries which do not
prepare their own financial statements may provide the consolidated accounts and
the audit report/self-declaration of the parent company/group they belong to under
the following conditions:
− the entity is exempt under national law from statutory audits
− only consolidated statements of the parent company/group the entity belongs
to are available
and
− the parent company assumes joint liability for all the debts of the entity (— all
conditions must be fulfilled).
In such cases, participants will be requested to provide additional documents to prove
these conditions.
28EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
❖ Parent companies — Parent companies which are exempt under national law
from publishing individual (i.e. non-consolidated) financial statements will be
requested to provide a dated and signed by the management simplified summary of
their non-consolidated profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
These simplified accounts must respect either the minimum reporting requirements
set out in the national accounting law or Annexes III, IV, V and VI of Directive
2013/349 (for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings
preceded by letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
If the provided financial information is not sufficiently clear, the Central Validation
Service may contact participants for further clarifications.
❖ Newly established enterprises that have not yet closed accounts — Must
provide estimated financial data (i.e. a business plan or a similar document including
financial projections on current and non-current assets, own capital, current and non-
current liabilities, turnover, operating and financial income and charges).
The financial data must respect either the minimum reporting requirements set out in
the national accounting law or to Annexes III, IV, V and VI of EU Directive 2013/34
(for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings preceded by
letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
❖ Natural persons engaged in an economic activity who do not prepare financial
statements in relation to their business activities — Are requested to provide:
− the annual income tax declaration containing details on the revenues and
expenses from business activity
− a signed declaration of patrimony, including:
− fixed patrimony (e.g. land, tenement, hereditament, medium/long-term
deposits (more than one year), stock options that cannot be exercised
within one year)
− current patrimony (e.g. available cash, savings, short-term deposits
(maximum of one year), stock-options that can be exercised within one
year)
and
− a signed declaration of debts, which must contain all liabilities (with dates and
figures), broken down in short-term debts (of maximum one year) and
medium/long-term debts (of more than one year).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities operating cash-based accounting — If the available financial
documents do not contain a profit and loss account and a balance sheet but are
limited to a cash flow statement and/or do not contain sufficient information10,
9 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual
financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of
undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and
repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19–76).
10 E.g. missing information on the nature of revenues, expenses or equity, nature and liquidity of
receivables and assets, maturity of debts etc.
29EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
declarations signed by the authorised legal representative of the entity may be
accepted, if they provide:
− information on fixed and current assets: buildings, equipment, inventory, cash,
short/long term11 deposits, short/long term receivables, sort/long term
liabilities, grants and equity/sources of funding, etc
− information on revenues and expenses, such as turnover from sales of goods
and services, operating income, staff expenses depreciation/amortisation
costs, interest expenses, etc.
In addition, it is recommended to provide any available evidence supporting the
declared amounts (e.g. bank statements confirming the available balance at
accounting closure date, etc).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities covered by a guarantor — Entities that are covered by a full financial
guarantee of another legal entity (i.e. guarantor) may submit the financial data of the
guarantor, provided that it is a full guarantee (i.e. the guarantor has assumed full
joint liability for all debts). Ad-hoc guarantees (covering, for instance, only the
participation in EU projects) cannot be accepted.
Participants that would like to have the financial capacity of their guarantor
assessed, must first contact the service in charge of their application for approval of
the guarantee. In case of approval, the service in charge will request the Central
Validation Service to proceed with the assessment of the guarantor.
4.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
If the financial documents do not contain sufficient information regarding the nature
and the maturity of the current assets, provisions and liabilities, and such information
is not provided, the financial assessment will be completed by taking the most
prudent approach, e.g. by considering the maturity of the current assets to be after
one year, and of the provisions and liabilities to be within one year.
11 Short term — maximum of one year; long term — more than one year.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The financial assessment is valid for 18 months after the closure date of the most
recent assessed accounting period. If during this period the participant applies for
another grant or tender, the financial documents will not be requested again.
However, if there are justified grounds to doubt the financial capacity, a new
assessment may be triggered even before the end of the 18 months.
4.4 Modification of the assessment
In case of disagreement with the assessment, the participant may contact the Central
Validation Service by sending additional justifications via Participant Register
message. The subject of the message should be clearly labelled as related to the
financial assessment (not PIC validation, LEAR assessment or other).
The Central Validation Service will carry out a re-assessment on the basis of the
additional documents.
4.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant made false declarations, their status may be
changed.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants or procurements, their
participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
5. Ownership control assessment
5.1 Ownership control assessment: Criteria and conditions
For funding programmes which have restricted calls in which only participants which
are directly or indirectly controlled by EU Member States or by nationals of EU
Member States (or by entities or nationals of specified eligible countries) are eligible,
the Central Validation Service will also handle the ownership control assessment
analysis.
The ownership control assessment must in principle be done for each new grant,
procurement or contribution agreement (— unless the participant already has a valid
ownership control assessment in the system performed by the Central Validation
Service that is not older than 18 months).
Moreover, the ownership control may be assessed ad hoc if there are grounds
justifying a new assessment, like for example:
− indication of third country control from other sources
− indication of ownership control changes after the initial assessment.
31EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The ownership control assessment will usually look into both ownership and control
elements, in order to assess whether an entity is EU controlled or non-EU controlled.
The focus is however on control (see Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and
CEF-DIG restricted calls*).
In this context, ‘control’ will be defined as the possibility to exercise decisive influence
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate entities, ‘de jure’ or ‘de facto’.
The fact that no influence is actually exercised is not relevant, as long as the
possibility exists.
Control will be assessed at the level of the ultimate ownership and control line and all
intermediate layers (in case of indirect control), taking into consideration decision-
making mechanisms, corporate governance, shareholders’/members’ rights, etc.
The assessment is based on the information provided by the participant in the
ownership control declaration* (annexed to their application for EU funding or
procurement procedure) and supporting documents to be provided by the participant
during the ownership control assessment procedure.
The role of the Central Validation Service is limited to identifying instances of
possible non-EU-country/entity control (e.g. to collect and to analyse the supporting
documents). The final decision will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender
separately by the EU service in charge, in accordance with the specific programme
rules.If needed, during grant preparation, the EU service in charge may contact
participants about the outcome of the ownership control assessment.
5.2 Documents and information to provide
5.2.1 General requirements and principles
The ownership control assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by
the participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be
kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the
EU services at any time).
As a general rule, ownership control documents must be provided in their original
language. For documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit
an English free (unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in
non-EU languages, a free translation in English is mandatory and must be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless

see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
5.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Graph visualising the complete ownership structure/chain of control, including
all ownership layers/chain of control until the ultimate owners.
2. Proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners and their respective
percentage of interest and voting rights, for instance commercial registry
extracts, articles of association/incorporation documents/memorandum of
association/company’s shareholders/members/partners book/registry extract,
etc with the exact distribution of shares/voting rights, i.e. name of
shareholders/members/partners and their percentage of interest andvoting
rights, as well as information on their place of establishment (in case of legal
entity) or nationality (in case of natural persons).
3. Statutes, articles of association, shareholders’/partnership agreements,
memorandum of understanding among shareholders, investment agreements
between shareholders and other relevant documents regarding the decision-
making procedures within the legal entity and the related rights of the
shareholders/members/partners.
4. Documents establishing/describing the decision-making bodies, rules regarding
election, appointment, nomination, dismissal and tenure of members, and
decision-making procedures (e.g. articles of association, bylaws, reports on
corporate governance, internal corporate governance rules, minutes of board
meetings, etc).
5. For participants that are listed companies, subsidiaries or controlled by a listed
company: report/minutes of the last three shareholders meetings, together
with the attendance list identifying the present/represented shareholders and
their respective votes.
6. Cooperation agreements with customers or suppliers, when they could confer
control over the participant — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
7. For shareholders/owners that provide financial contributions: supporting
documents (loans, by-laws, etc) that justify the financial contribution;
documents showing the link between the shareholder/owner and the entity
providing the financing — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
8. Information about any other means, process or links that could ultimately
confer control to a non-EU country or non-EU country entity.
9. Copy of ID card(s) or passport(s) indicating the nationality of the ultimate
owner(s).
The same documents and information must be provided for each intermediate
controlling entity, up to the ultimate owners. The supporting documents must
demonstrate the complete ownership structure, including all layers of ownership and
non-controlling entities.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Guarantees for non-EU controlled entities (if allowed by the call conditions and
required by the EU service in charge) are not part of the ownership control
assessment and must therefore be submitted directly to the EU service in charge of
the grant/tender, in accordance with the specific programme rules.
5.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
not to finalise the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and
documents submitted or publicly available).
5.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The ownership control assessment is in principle valid for 18 months. If during this
period the participant applies for another grant or tender and confirms that the
ownership control status has not changed, the supporting documents will not be
requested again.
In this case, the participants will still have to submit the ownership control
declaration with the application, but there will be no check by the Central Validation
Service, unless there are justified grounds to doubt the declaration.
5.4 Modification of the assessment
Changes in the ownership control status need to be communicated to the granting
authority/contracting authority, which will trigger a new assessment by the Central
Validation Service, if needed.
For more information on the ownership control assessment procedure, see the
Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and CEF-DIG restricted calls*.

EU FUNDING & TENDERS PORTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE
1.1 The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is an electronic portal and exchange
system managed by the European Commission and used by itself and several
other EU services (together ‘EU’), for the management of EU funding/tenders (i.e.
grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, experts, etc).
1.2 It is currently open to:
− users applying for or managing EU grants, tenders and prizes
− entities entering into EU contribution agreements
− external experts and audit firms appointed to work for the EU in the
context of EU funding programmes
and allows them to:
− register (in the Participant Register or Expert Data Base) and view and
edit their data
− create, revise and submit proposals for funding and tenders
− prepare and sign contracts
− manage their projects and contracts (e.g. submit deliverables, reports
and payment requests)
− for experts: perform their tasks inside the system (evaluation,
monitoring, etc)
− for external audit firms: perform their tasks inside the system (audit
management).
1.3 These Terms and Conditions govern the relation between the following parties:
− the European Commission (as owner of the Portal)
and
− users
in relation to access and use of the Portal.
For the avoidance of doubt, it does not cover the terms and conditions related to
the grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements or expert contracts that
are managed through the Portal; those are governed by their own legal framework
and contractual arrangements.
1.4 Requesting access to the Portal, accessing the Portal or using the Portal signifies
unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
Users will be requested to agree explicitly to the Terms and Conditions on their first
login to the Portal.
For users acting on behalf of organisations, the legal representatives of the
organisations will also be asked to explicitly agree at the moment they appoint their
LEAR/EXAFs (through the ‘declaration of consent’; see below).
3EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Organisations must provide their LEAR/EXAFs, LSIGNs and FSIGNs with a copy of
these Terms and Conditions.
Users are responsible for regularly verifying the applicable Terms and Conditions.
1.5 These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the
European Commission and users, as regards the conditions for access and use of
the Portal.
2. ACCESS TO THE PORTAL
2.1 Users
2.1.1 Access to the public parts of the Portal is open to all users.
2.1.2 Access to the Portal electronic exchange system (EES) is open only to persons
with an EU Login account.
2.1.3 Access rights to certain information and functions in the EES are restricted to
users with specific roles (which are in turn linked to their functions within their
organisation or in relation to a particular
proposal/project/grant/contract/agreement).
2.1.4 Organisations can access the EES only via individual users employed by or
representing them.
2.2 Means of access to the EES — EU Login user account
2.2.1 Users must obtain an EU Login account in accordance with the applicable
procedures.
Users who already have an EU Login account must use that account.
2.2.2 Users guarantee that the information provided for registration for the account is
accurate and complete.
The European Commission has — at any time — the right to verify the accuracy
and validity of the information.
If this reveals any inaccuracy or invalidity, the European Commission has the right
to close the account and suspend or refuse access.
2.2.3 The means of access (i.e. the user name and password) are strictly personal and
users are responsible for safeguarding their confidentiality and security, and
ensuring their appropriate use.
Users undertake to take all steps to prevent any unauthorised third party from
gaining knowledge and making use thereof.
Users may not transfer or sell their means of access to third parties.
Users must notify the European Commission immediately (via the IT Helpdesk;
see Funding & Tenders Portal Support menu) of the loss, theft, breach of
confidentiality or any risk of misuse of the means of access.
If the European Commission has any reason to suspect that the confidentiality or
security of the means of access has been breached or that the EES is being
misused, it may — without prior notice — suspend or refuse access.

2.4 LEAR appointment
2.4.1 Organisations using the EES for transactions requiring electronic signatures are
required to appoint a LEAR.
2.4.2 Individuals (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons) will automatically have the
role of LEAR (no appointment needed); but they will have to provide the
supporting documents. Organisations can appoint only one LEAR — who can be
replaced if necessary, following the same appointment process.
2.4.3 Organisations warrant that the person appointed as LEAR is duly authorised to
represent them in relation to all LEAR responsibilities.
Organisations are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of the LEAR
responsibilities and to ensure that the LEAR remains at all times duly authorised
to represent them in relation to these responsibilities.
2.4.4 Supporting documents must be provided directly in the system.
2.4.5 Signed originals must be kept on file for controls (which may take place at any
moment and independently of any ongoing grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements or expert contracts).
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to the closure of the EU Login

grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements and expert contracts).
2.5 Appointment of signatories in the EES — (P)LSIGNs and (P)FSIGNs
2.5.1 The LEAR must appoint one or more LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation.
2.5.2 The LEAR and its organisation warrant that the persons appointed as LSIGNs or
FSIGNs are duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to all LSIGN
or FSIGN responsibilities.
The LEAR and its organisation are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of
the LSIGN and FSIGN responsibilities and to ensure that the LSIGNs and FSIGNs
remain at all times duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to
these responsibilities.
2.5.3 The CoCo or PaCo must appoint the PLSIGNs and PFSIGNs for individual grants
procurements and contribution agreements from the list of LSIGNs and FSIGNs for
their organisation.
2.6 Data updates on the EES roles
2.6.1 The LEAR is responsible for keeping data related to the organisation roles up-to-
date.
2.6.2 The CoCo/PaCo are responsible for keeping data related to the project roles up-to-
date.
2.7 Deactivation of old e-mail addresses/accounts
2.7.1 The LEAR has the ultimate responsibility for overseeing that old e-mail
addresses/user accounts are deactivated and removed from the organisation- and
project roles.
2.8 General obligation to channel information to the right addressees
2.8.1 If made aware of misled communications, the LEAR has the obligation to re-direct
them and ensure proper follow-up and correction for the future.

3.1.5 Organisations acknowledge and accept that they are responsible for the actions
and omissions of persons employed by or representing them, acting as users of
the Portal.
3.1.6 Users are liable for — and will indemnify and hold harmless the European
Commission against — any damage that results from:
− changes made to the Portal or
− use of the Portal in a manner that does not correspond with these Terms and
Conditions.
3.2 Required hardware, software and services
3.2.1 Users acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for the choice, purchase
and operation of hardware, software and telecommunication services required to
connect with and to use the Portal.

minimum requirements, as specified on the Portal (if any).
Users are responsible for the installation and costs of purchasing and licensing
such hardware, software or telecommunication services.
3.2.2 The European Commission is not liable for hardware, software, products and
services of third parties (such as telecommunication equipment, internet

3.3 Electronic notifications and signatures in the EES
3.3.1 Users acknowledge and accept that under these Terms and Conditions and in line

integrity of the data and the accuracy of the date and time of sending or
receiving (as indicated by the EES logs)
(b) a document sent or notified through the EES is considered as equivalent
to a paper document, is admissible as evidence in legal proceedings, is
deemed original and enjoys legal presumption of its authenticity and
integrity, provided it does not contain any dynamic features capable of
automatically changing it
(c) electronic signatures made by users through the EES have the
equivalent legal effect of handwritten signatures.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
3.3.2 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) any communication or document sent or notified using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper document with a handwritten signature and shall be
admissible as evidence in legal proceedings and constitute sufficient
evidence in legal proceedings
(b) any declaration, contract (or amendment) signed using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper declaration/contract with a handwritten signature and shall

(i) the existence or validity of any communication, document,
declaration or contract signed using any type of electronic
signature through the EES or
(ii) the admissibility of any communication, document, declaration or
contract submitted or signed through the EES as evidence in legal
proceedings, solely on the basis that such communication,
document, declaration or contract was submitted electronically
through the EES or signed with an electronic signature.
3.3.3 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) communications in the EES are generally considered to have been made
when they are sent by the sending party (i.e. on the date and time they
are sent through the EES, as indicated by the time logs)
(b) where formal notifications are required, these are considered to have
been made when they are received by the receiving party (i.e. on the
date and time they are accessed in the EES by the receiving party, as
indicated by the time logs); formal notifications that have not been
accessed within 10 calendar days after sending are considered to have
been accessed.
3.3.4 The European Commission registers access and use of the EES.
This access and use log provides evidence that access and use has been made of
EES, unless users can prove the contrary.
3.3.5 Electronic messages, connections, operations on the network and transactions
between the EU and the users shall be proven using the logs and transaction files
kept electronically by the European Commission.
Users accept the evidential value of this data.
This does not prevent the parties from providing other proof, using permitted
legal methods (such as proof on paper).
3.4 Intellectual property rights
3.4.1 The intellectual and industrial property rights and know-how associated with the
Portal belong exclusively to the European Commission and its licensors.
Only the European Commission has the right to correct errors.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
3.4.2 The European Commission grants users a non-transferable, limited, non-exclusive
licence to use the Portal for their own professional purposes (unless access is
suspended or refused).
Without prejudice to the rights of users under applicable legislation relating to the
protection of computer programs (which cannot be contractually denied), users
may not in any way:
(a) modify, translate or adapt the Portal
(b) decompile or disassemble the Portal
(c) copy the Portal (or parts of it)
(d) pass on, dispose of, grant as a sub-licence, lease, lend or distribute the
Portal or Portal documentation to third parties

ensure the availability of the Portal.
The European Commission does not guarantee that the Portal will be available
without interruption or degradation of service.
In case of technical problems affecting the submission of application documents,
the European Commission reserves the right to cancel calls without entitlement to
compensation.
3.6 Suspension and refusal of access
3.6.1 Users acknowledge that the European Commission may refuse access to a user
logging in, if a session is already open on another computer where another user is
using the same means of access (i.e. the same EU Login account name and
password).
3.6.2 Users acknowledge and accept that the European Commission may suspend or
refuse access to the Portal:
(a) in case of suspected or actual breach of these Terms and Conditions
(b) if the information provided for the registration for an EU Login account is
inaccurate or invalid (clause 2.2.2)
(c) if the European Commission has any reason to suspect that the
confidentiality or security of the means of access (i.e. EU Login account
name and password) have been breached or compromised or that the
Portal is being misused (clause 2.2.3)
(d) in case of fraudulent practices
(e) if the IT systems of the European Commission are being attacked
(f) if required under applicable laws or regulations
(g) to avoid any detrimental impact for the European Commission or a user

(h) for preventive, corrective or routine maintenance and
(i) in any other situation where the European Commission considers that
suspension or refusal of access is reasonably required or desirable.
3.6.3 The European Commission is not liable for any damage suffered in connection with
the suspension or refusal of access.
4. MISCELLANEOUS
4.1 Personal data
4.1.1 Personal data submitted or otherwise collected through the Portal is subject to the

4.2 Waiving of rights
4.2.1 The rights and remedies of a party under these Terms and Conditions may be
waived only by express written notice to the other party.
4.2.2 Any waiver shall apply only in the specific instance, and for the purpose for which
it is given.
4.3 Liability and damages
4.3.1 Users may be held liable for misuse of the Portal under the conditions set out in
clause 3.1.6.
4.3.2 In addition to clauses 3.2.2 and 3.6.3 and to the maximum extent permitted by
the applicable law (see clause 4.7.2), neither the European Commission nor any
other EU service shall be liable for any direct or indirect damage of any kind
(including disruption of business, third party claims and loss of profits, anticipated
savings, or goodwill), except in the event of wilful misconduct.
To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, neither the European
Commission nor any other EU service can be held liable for gross negligence.
Neither the European Commission nor any other EU service are responsible or
liable for any damage in case of force majeure, external cause or any other events
which are not under their reasonable control.
4.4 Interpretation
4.4.1 These Terms and Conditions have been drawn up in English and its provisions will
be interpreted and construed in accordance with applicable law (see clause 4.6)
and their generally accepted meanings in the English language.
Any translation of these Terms and Conditions is for the convenience of the
parties only, and shall not be binding towards any party.
In the event of any inconsistency between the English original and its translation,
the provisions of the English version shall prevail.
4.4.2 For participants that are international organisations, nothing in these Terms and
Conditions shall constitute, be deemed or construed as a waiver or modification of
their privileges or immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or
international law.

4.4.3 International organisations that have also concluded a financial framework
partnership agreement with the EU, may moreover rely on the provisions set out
in that framework agreement— provided they do not call into question the lawful
access and use of the Portal in line with the intended purposes set out in the
Terms and Conditions.
4.4.4 If a provision of these Terms and Conditions is or becomes invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, it shall (if possible and insofar as it is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) be replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable clause that reflects
the initial intentions as closely as possible.
If the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision cannot be validly replaced, no
effect is to be given to the clause and it shall be deemed not to be included in
these Terms and Conditions, without affecting or invalidating the remaining
provisions of these Terms and Conditions.
4.5 Changes

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES AND
OTHER PARTICIPANTS
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting
authority for implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance
with all the obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action
under their own responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated
entities or other participants (see Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the
granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the
beneficiaries fails to implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure
that this part is implemented by someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the
maximum grant amount and subject to an amendment; see Article 39). The financial
responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding
the grant for the entire duration of the action. Unit contributions will be eligible only as long
as the beneficiary and the action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see
Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the
implementation of the action (see Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the prefinancing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements
(CFS) (if required; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
20Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article
21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority
under the Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their
affiliated entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and
the granting authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies
otherwise, and in particular:
- submit the prefinancing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify
their quality and completeness before passing them on to the granting
authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other
beneficiaries (report on the distribution of payments; if required, see
Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other
beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other
beneficiary or third party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii)
last indent and (iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have
created or which are controlled by or affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains
sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance with the obligations under the
Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’15 (or similar, such as European research
infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to
one of their members. The coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the
obligations under the Agreement.
15 For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy
the criteria for being awarded a grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole
beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the purpose of implementing the action
financed by the grant.”
21Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-
ordination, to ensure that the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of
recoveries (if any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article
16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked actions, the beneficiaries must have
arrangements with the participants of the other action, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the
consortium is the same, as part of their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of
outputs, common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy
activities, common communication and dissemination activities, sharing of
information, access to background and results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in
both actions.
The arrangements with the participants of the other action must not contain any provision
contrary to this Agreement.]

OLAF, Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the affiliated
entities.
Breaches by affiliated entities will be handled in the same manner as breaches by
beneficiaries. Recovery of undue amounts will be handled through the beneficiaries.
If the granting authority requires joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see Data
Sheet, Point 4.4), they must sign the declaration set out in Annex 3a and may be held liable in
case of enforced recoveries against their beneficiaries (see Article 22.2 and 22.4).]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable]

Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment,
other goods, works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge), if necessary for the
implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not

ARTICLE 10 — PARTICIPANTS WITH SPECIAL STATUS
10.1 Non-EU participants
Participants which are established in a non-EU country (if any) undertake to comply with
their obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical
principles, environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information,
intellectual property rights, visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
24Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use qualified external auditors
which are independent and comply with comparable standards as those set out in EU
Directive 2006/43/EC16
- for the controls under Article 25: to allow for checks, reviews, audits and
investigations (including on-the-spot checks, visits and inspections) by the bodies
mentioned in that Article (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court of Auditors (ECA),
etc.).
Special rules on dispute settlement apply (see Data Sheet, Point 5).
10.2 Participants which are international organisations
Participants which are international organisations (IOs; if any) undertake to comply with their
obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical
principles, environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information,
intellectual property rights, visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use either independent public
officers or external auditors which comply with comparable standards as those set out
in EU Directive 2006/43/EC17
- for the controls under Article 25: to allow for the checks, reviews, audits and
investigations by the bodies mentioned in that Article, taking into account the specific
agreements concluded by them and the EU (if any).
For such participants, nothing in the Agreement will be interpreted as a waiver of their
privileges or immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or international law.
Special rules on applicable law and dispute settlement apply (see Article 43 and Data Sheet,
Point 5).
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
Pillar-assessed participants (if any) may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in so
far as they have been positively assessed and do not call into question the decision awarding
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and
procedures which participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control
system, accounting system, external audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and
exclusion, information on recipients and protection of personal data; see Article 157 EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
16 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of
annual accounts and consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
17 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of
annual accounts and consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
25Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and
procedures, in particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards,
rules and procedures
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in
accordance with usual accounting practices
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, prefinancing guarantees are not
needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their
regular internal or external auditors and in accordance with their internal
financial regulations and procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if
those practices are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no
recovery if the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue
amounts from the third party receiving the support (including legal proceedings)
and non-recovery is not due to an error or negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be
conducted taking into account the rules and procedures specifically agreed
between them and the framework agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the
participant’s internal rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment
will be calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into
before the pre-information letter was received and could not reasonably be
terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated
for damage it sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because
the action was not implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the
damage is due to an infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures
or due to a violation of third parties’ rights by the participant or one of its
employees or individual for whom the employees are responsible.
26Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do
purchases, subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance
with their internal rules and procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal
standards, rules and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the
grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use),
communication, dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems,
rules and procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules
and procedures that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately
inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU,
may moreover — under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the
decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries) — rely on the provisions set out in that framework agreement.

EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
20.1 Keeping records and supporting documents
The beneficiaries must — at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6) —
keep records and other supporting documents to prove the proper implementation of the
action in line with the accepted standards in the respective field (if any).
In addition, the beneficiaries must — for the same period — keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the number of units declared; beneficiaries do not need to
keep specific records on the actual costs incurred.
The records and supporting documents must be made available upon request (see Article 19)
or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of
claims under the Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 25), the
beneficiaries must keep these records and other supporting documentation until the end of
these procedures.
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are
considered originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The granting
authority may accept non-original documents if they offer a comparable level of assurance.
20.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, unit contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
21.1 Continuous reporting
The beneficiaries must report on the progress of the action (e.g. deliverables, milestones,
outputs/outcomes, critical risks, indicators, etc; if any), in the Portal Continuous Reporting

authority).
Standardised deliverables (e.g. progress reports not linked to payments, reports on cumulative
expenditure, special reports, etc; if any) must be submitted using the templates published on
the Portal.
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
In addition, the beneficiaries must provide reports to request payments, in accordance with the
schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2):
- for additional prefinancings (if any): an additional prefinancing report
- for interim payments (if any) and the final payment: a periodic report.
36Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The prefinancing and periodic reports include a technical and financial part.
The technical part includes an overview of the action implementation. It must be prepared
using the template available in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool.
The financial part of the additional prefinancing report includes a statement on the use of the
previous prefinancing payment.
The financial part of the periodic report includes:
- the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all beneficiaries/affiliated
entities)
- the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
- the certificates on the financial statements (CFS): not applicable.
The financial statements must detail the contributions for the units implemented in the
reporting period.
Unit contributions which are not declared in a financial statement will not be taken into
account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statements (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the
beneficiaries confirm that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the unit contributions declared are eligible (see Article 6)
- the contributions can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting documents
(see Article 20) that will be produced upon request (see Article 19) or in the context
of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 25).
Beneficiaries will have to submit also the financial statements of their affiliated entities (if
any). In case of recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the
financial statements of their affiliated entities.
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
The financial statements must be drafted in euro.
21.4 Reporting language
The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).

EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
ARTICLE 22 — PAYMENTS AND RECOVERIES — CALCULATION OF
AMOUNTS DUE
22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.2) and must be distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to
distribution of the initial prefinancing payment; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment
obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date
when they are debited to its account.
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it
turns out that the granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts
undue.
The general liability regime for recoveries (first-line liability) is as follows: At final payment,
the coordinator will be fully liable for recoveries, even if it has not been the final recipient of
the undue amounts. At beneficiary termination or after final payment, recoveries will be made
directly against the beneficiaries concerned.
Beneficiaries will be fully liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4):
- the beneficiaries will be jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of another
beneficiary under the Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
- affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of their beneficiaries under the
Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority
(see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).
22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Prefinancing payments
The aim of the prefinancing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
38Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
For additional prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous
prefinancing payment shows that less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data
Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the 70% threshold and the amount used.
Prefinancing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent)
against amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to
that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
At beneficiary termination there will be no payment, but the grant must be provisionally
closed for the beneficiary which leaves the consortium (and the affiliated entities which had to
end their participation together with the beneficiary, if any).
Payments (if any) will be made with the next interim or final payment.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary
for all reporting periods, by calculating the unit contributions for the accepted units.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the
distribution of payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{ total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments received (if
any)}}.
If the balance is positive, the amount will be included in the next interim or final payment to
the consortium.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
39Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this
amount to be paid to the coordinator (confirmation letter).
The amounts will later on also be taken into account for the next interim or final payment.
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible contributions claimed for the units implemented
during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out
the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply
recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the
reporting period, by calculating the unit contributions for the accepted units.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary
termination (if any). The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of prefinancing and
interim payments (if any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).

EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the eligible contributions claimed for
the remaining units implemented (if any).
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report. Its approval does not imply
recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all
reporting periods, by calculating the unit contributions for the accepted units.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
If the resulting amount is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.2, it will
be limited to the latter.
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Not applicable
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of prefinancing
and interim payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{
final grant amount
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments made (if
any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
41Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and date for payment.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see
Article 25) — the granting authority rejects unit contributions (see Article 27) or reduces the
grant (see Article 28), it will calculate the revised final grant amount for the beneficiary
concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the
beneficiary, by calculating the ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total
accepted EU contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its
share in the final grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is
calculated as follows:
{{
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the
action}
42Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
multiplied by
}
final grant amount for the action .
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons
why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be
recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent —
against any amounts owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may
be offset before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU
executive agency, debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other
Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) by drawing on the financial guarantee(s) (if any)
(c) by holding other beneficiaries jointly and severally liable (if any; see Data Sheet, Point
4.4)
(d) by holding affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point
4.4) or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that the granting authority is the
European Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable
decision under Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and
Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in
Article 22.5, from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including
the date the full payment is received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and
then against the principal.
43Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless
Directive 2015/236621 applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by
offsetting or enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission
(see also Article 43).
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the
beneficiaries are entitled to late-payment interest at the reference rate applied by the
European Central Bank (ECB) for its main refinancing operations in euros, plus the
percentage specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The ECB reference rate to be used is the
rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as published
in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the
coordinator only on request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional
and local government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State
for the purpose of this Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not
be considered as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for
payment (see above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.
22.5.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28) and the grant or the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 23 — GUARANTEES
23.1 Prefinancing guarantee
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2), the beneficiaries must
provide (one or more) prefinancing guarantee(s) in accordance with the timing and the
amounts set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them to the granting authority in due time before the
prefinancing they are linked to.
21 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment
services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and
Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (OJ L 337, 23.12.2015, p. 35).
44Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The guarantees must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the
following conditions:
(a) be provided by a bank or approved financial institution established in the EU or — if
requested by the coordinator and accepted by the granting authority — by a third party
or a bank or financial institution established outside the EU offering equivalent
security
(b) the guarantor stands as first-call guarantor and does not require the granting authority
to first have recourse against the principal debtor (i.e. the beneficiary concerned) and
(c) remain explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the
form of a recovery, until five months after the debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
They will be released within the following month.
23.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If the beneficiaries breach their obligation to provide the prefinancing guarantee, the
prefinancing will not be paid.
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.

45Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the
deadline requested — any information and data in addition to deliverables and reports already
submitted (including information on the use of resources). The granting authority may request
beneficiaries to provide such information to it directly. Sensitive information and documents
will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings,
including with the outside experts.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises
(including to the outside experts) and must ensure that information requested is readily

The granting authority may carry out audits on the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Agreement.
Such audits may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the beneficiary
concerned and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
The granting authority may use its own audit service, delegate audits to a centralised service
or use external audit firms. If it uses an external firm, the beneficiary concerned will be
informed and have the right to object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of
interest.
The beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline
requested — any information (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or
other personal data) to verify compliance with the Agreement. Sensitive information and
documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises
(including for the external audit firm) and must ensure that information requested is readily
available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested,
including electronic format.
On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which
has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
46Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and
will be formally notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement.
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights
of checks, reviews and audits as the granting authority.
25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the
periodic assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.
25.4 OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
The following bodies may also carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations — during
the action or afterwards:
22
- the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) under Regulations No 883/2013 and No
23
2185/96
- the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) under Regulation 2017/1939
- the European Court of Auditors (ECA) under Article 287 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 263 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If requested by these bodies, the beneficiary concerned must provide full, accurate and
complete information in the format requested (including complete accounts, individual salary
statements or other personal data, including in electronic format) and allow access to sites and
premises for on-the-spot visits or inspections — as provided for under these Regulations.
To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the
action, at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until
any ongoing checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have
been concluded.
25.5 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations — Extension of
findings
25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant

47Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures
described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount
(see Article 22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may
lead to a request for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set
out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities,
fraud or breach of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU
grants awarded under similar conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Findings of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this
grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions, to have committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or
breach of obligations that have a material impact on this grant and
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the
list of grants affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to
extend the findings and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of unit contributions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors, to calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or
practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors and the principle of proportionality.
48Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations,
revised financial statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction
method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the
implementation (i.e. start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the
revised financial statements or the announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see
Articles 27 and 28).
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, unit contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the
objectives and indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit
set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or
beneficiaries and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact
of the action, including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may
apply the measures described in Chapter 5.
CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at beneficiary termination, interim payment, final payment or
afterwards — reject any unit contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in particular
following checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant
(see Article 25).
Ineligible unit contributions will be rejected.
49Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The
coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification —
submit observations if it disagrees with the rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects unit contributions, it will deduct them from the contributions
declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards —
reduce the grant for a beneficiary, if:
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and
proportionate to the seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach
of obligations, by applying an individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the
reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving
notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the reduction (payment review
procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
50Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the
amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment
cannot be processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or
additional information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing extension procedure,
queries about eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons
why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will
be lifted — and the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to
confirm if the suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the
revised report is not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority
may also terminate the grant or the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for
one or more beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
51Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make
partial payment(s) for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the
payment (or recovery) of the remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to
be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the
coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting
authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the
suspension end date.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For
interim payments, the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article
21) must not contain any financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated
entities). The coordinator must include them in the next periodic report after the suspension is
lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of the action — in the last periodic report.
ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional
circumstances — in particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation
impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
52Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- the reasons why
- the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission
of the amendment request and
- the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately
request another amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption
date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes
necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been
terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the suspension end
date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no units may be implemented.
Ongoing units must be interrupted and no new units may be started. Unit contributions for
activities implemented during grant suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(c) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA suspension grounds: not applicable.
53Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification).
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority
will formally notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the
suspension end date and invite the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to
set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the
grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the
suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be before the date
on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no units may be implemented
Ongoing units must be interrupted and no new units may be started. Unit contributions for
activities implemented during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see
Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a
beneficiary (see Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
54Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a
periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of
the report submitted and taking into account the unit contributions for activities implemented
before the end of work date (see Article 22).
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only unit
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries,
on request of the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment
request must be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
55Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting
period until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the
financial statement and the explanation on the use of resources,
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary;
change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the
report submitted and taking into account the unit contributions for activities implemented
before the end of work date (see Article 22).
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the
next reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only unit
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into
question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant
termination (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21
(reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27
(rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.3 EU-initiated GA or beneficiary termination
32.3.1 Conditions

action or calls into question the decision to award the grant (including changes linked
to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour)
(c) following termination of one or more beneficiaries, the necessary changes to the
Agreement (and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
(d) implementation of the action has become impossible or the changes necessary for its
continuation would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants
(e) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is subject to bankruptcy
proceedings or similar (including insolvency, winding-up, administration by a
liquidator or court, arrangement with creditors, suspension of business activities, etc.)
(f) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is in breach of social
security or tax obligations
(g) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been found guilty of
grave professional misconduct
(h) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed fraud,
corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money laundering, terrorism-

cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.)
(k) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in
other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact

EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
one of its affiliated entities or associated partners that is in one of the situations under
points (d), (f), (e), (g), (h), (i) or (j) and to reallocate its tasks, or
(m) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA termination grounds: not applicable.
32.3.2 Procedure
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting
authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will
take effect (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is
discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also
inform the coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit
a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the
basis of the report submitted (see Article 22). Only units implemented until
termination will be accepted.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator
may not submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only unit
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see
Article 28) or to impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
58Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority
(see Article 33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —
submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open
reporting period until termination, containing an overview of the progress
of the work, the financial statement, and the explanation on the use of
resources
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated
beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of
the report submitted (see Article 22). Only units implemented until termination will be
accepted.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report
for the next reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline,
only unit contributions included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments
within the deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned
and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal
treatment of applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
59Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND ADMINISTRATIVE
SANCTIONS
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to
third parties as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross
negligence.
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the
beneficiaries or other participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the
implementation of the Agreement.
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a
result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full
compliance with the Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.
The liability does not extend to indirect or consequential losses or similar damage (such as
loss of profit, loss of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by
wilful act or by a breach of confidentiality.
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as preventing the adoption of administrative
sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public
law measures, in addition or as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this
Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to 148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and
Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 2988/9524).
SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot
be considered in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
24 Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European
Communities financial interests (OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1).
60Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement,
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control,
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants
involved in the action), and
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without
delay, stating the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force
majeure and do their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.
CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal, in accordance with the
Portal Terms and Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if
explicitly instructed otherwise by the granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the grant agreement (project
number and acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and
Conditions. For naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated —
before the signature of this Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’.
The role and tasks of the LEAR are stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms
and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the
Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of
sending, as indicated by the time logs.
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the
communication is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not
been accessed within 10 days after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general
principles apply (i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with
proof of delivery will be considered to have been received either on the delivery date
registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection at the post office.
61Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be
considered in breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Addresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is
the official mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.
ARTICLE 37 — INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT
The provisions in the Data Sheet take precedence over the rest of the Terms and Conditions of
the Agreement.
Annex 5 takes precedence over the Terms and Conditions; the Terms and Conditions take
precedence over the Annexes other than Annex 5.
Annex 2 takes precedence over Annex 1.
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7125, periods expressed in days, months or years are
calculated from the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement
which would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in
the Portal Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries
(see Annex 3). If a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission
must be done by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
25 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to
periods, dates and time-limits (OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
62Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or
proof that this opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45
days of receiving notification (or any additional information the granting authority has
requested). If it does not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same
deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no
notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the
amendment.
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession
form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry
into force of the Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
its entry into force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must
— within 30 days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and
make any changes necessary to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not
affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with
Article 39. It must include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary
directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
63Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the
grant to a new beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal
Amendment tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE
GRANTING AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting
authority to any third party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority
on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed,
the assignment will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations
towards the granting authority.
ARTICLE 43 — APPLICABLE LAW AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
43.1 Applicable law
The Agreement is governed by the applicable EU law, supplemented if necessary by the law
of Belgium.
Special rules may apply for beneficiaries which are international organisations (if any; see
Data Sheet, Point 5).
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties
must bring action before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice —
under Article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium — unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU
court judgements.
64Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet,
Point 5), the dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in
accordance with the Rules for Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under
Article 299 TFEU (see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the
General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions
against offsetting and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European
Commission (not against the granting authority; see also Article 22).
ARTICLE 44 — ENTRY INTO FORCE
The Agreement will enter into force on the day of signature by the granting authority or the
coordinator, depending on which is later.

SPECIFIC RULES
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) — BACKGROUND AND RESULTS —
ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE (— ARTICLE 16)
Rights of use of the granting authority on results for information, communication,
dissemination and publicity purposes
The granting authority also has the right to exploit non-sensitive results of the action for
information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes, using any of the
following modes:
- use for its own purposes (in particular, making them available to persons working for
the granting authority or any other EU service (including institutions, bodies, offices,
agencies, etc.) or EU Member State institution or body; copying or reproducing them
in whole or in part, in unlimited numbers; and communication through press
information services)
- distribution to the public in hard copies, in electronic or digital format, on the
internet including social networks, as a downloadable or non-downloadable file
- editing or redrafting (including shortening, summarising, changing, correcting,
cutting, inserting elements (e.g. meta-data, legends or other graphic, visual, audio or
text elements), extracting parts (e.g. audio or video files), dividing into parts or use in
a compilation)
- translation (including inserting subtitles/dubbing) in all official languages of EU
- storage in paper, electronic or other form
- archiving in line with applicable document-management rules
- the right to authorise third parties to act on its behalf or sub-license to third parties,
including if there is licensed background, any of the rights or modes of exploitation set
out in this provision
- processing, analysing, aggregating the results and producing derivative works
- disseminating the results in widely accessible databases or indexes (such as through
‘open access’ or ‘open data’ portals or similar repositories, whether free of charge or
not).
The beneficiaries must ensure these rights of use for the whole duration they are protected by
industrial or intellectual property rights.
If results are subject to moral rights or third party rights (including intellectual property rights
or rights of natural persons on their image and voice), the beneficiaries must ensure that they
72Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
comply with their obligations under this Agreement (in particular, by obtaining the necessary
licences and authorisations from the rights holders concerned).
Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and
national authorities to results for policy purposes
The beneficiaries must grant access to their results — on a royalty-free basis — to the
granting authority, other EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, for developing,
implementing and monitoring EU policies or programmes.
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
The access rights also extend to national authorities of EU Member States or associated
countries, for developing, implementing and monitoring their policies or programmes in this
area. In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions
ensuring that:
- the access will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency
(including the granting authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.
COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY (— ARTICLE 17)
Additional communication and dissemination activities
The beneficiaries must engage in the following additional communication and dissemination

on the beneficiaries’ websites or social media accounts
- for actions involving public events, display signs and posters mentioning the action and
the European flag and funding statement and special logo
- upload the public project results to the European Solidarity Corps Project Results
platform, available through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Limited communication and visibility to protect persons involved
Where the communication, dissemination or visibility obligations set out in Article 17 or this
Annex would harm the safety of persons involved in the action, the beneficiaries may submit
appropriate alternative arrangements to the granting authority for approval.
Special logo and visibility in field operations
The European Solidarity Corps logo must be displayed in communication activities,
infrastructure, equipment or major results funded by the grant and on signboards, office
buildings, goods, equipment, clothing items, etc. worn by project staff:

74Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: ESC Unit MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Moreover, for humanitarian aid volunteering actions, the beneficiaries must respect the
following conditions:
- implement the action in compliance with:
- applicable EU, international and national law (in particular Article 214 of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Consensus on

regions where the operations are carried out
- ensure that the action is implemented with utmost regard to the safety and security of
volunteers and the final recipients of the assistance
- ensure zero tolerance in relation to all wrongful conduct that has an impact on their

EU restrictive measures in volunteering actions
The beneficiaries must ensure that the EU grant does not benefit any affiliated entities,
associated partners, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties that are

or Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).

law. Persons in need must therefore not be vetted.
