EU classified information, “European Union classified information (EUCI) means any information or material
designated by an EU security classification, the unauthorised disclosure of which could cause varying degrees of
prejudice to the interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States”.
3 Classified background information is information that is already classified by a country and/or international
organisation and/or the EU and is going to be used by the project. In this case, the project must have in advance the
authorisation from the originator of the classified information, which is the entity (EU institution, EU Member State,
third state or international organisation) under whose authority the classified information has been generated.
4 EU classified foreground information is information (documents/deliverables/materials) planned to be generated by
the project and that needs to be protected from unauthorised disclosure. The originator of the EUCI generated by the
project is the European Commission.

of 11 March 2005
on the European Charter for Researchers
and on a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment
of Researchers
The Commission ofthe European Communities
Having regard to the Treatyestablishing the European Community, and in
particular Article 165 thereof
Whereas
(1) The Commission considered itnecessaryin January2000 1to estab-
lish the European Research Area asthe linchpin ofthe Community’s
future action in thisfield with a view to consolidating and giving struc-
ture to a European research policy.
(2) The Lisbon European Council set the Community the objective of
becoming the mostcompetitive and dynamicknowledge economyin
the world by2010.
(3) The Councilhasaddressed issuesrelated to the profession and the
career ofresearcherswithin the European Research Area in itsResolution
of10 November 2003 2and welcomed in particular the Commission’s
intention to worktowardsthe developmentofa European Researcher’s
Charter and a Code ofConductfor the RecruitmentofResearchers.

2 JO C282, p. 1-2, of25.11.2003. CouncilResolution of10 November 2003 (2003/C282/01 on
the profession and the career ofresearcherswithin the European Research Area).
3(4) The identified potentialshortage ofresearchers3, particularlyin cer-
tain key disciplines, will pose a serious threat to EU’s innovative
strength, knowledge capacity and productivity growth in the near
future and mayhamper the attainmentofthe Lisbon and Barcelona
objectives. Consequently, Europe must dramatically improve its
attractiveness to researchers and strengthen the participation of
women researchersbyhelping to create the necessaryconditionsfor
more sustainable and appealing careersfor them in R&D 4.
(5) Sufficientand well-developed human resourcesin R&D are the cor-
nerstone of advancement in scientific knowledge, technological
progress, enhancing the qualityoflife, ensuring the welfare ofEuro-
pean citizensand contributing to Europe’scompetitiveness.
(6) New instrumentsfor the career developmentofresearchersshould be
introduced and implemented, thuscontributing to the improvement
ofcareer prospectsfor researchersin Europe.
(7) Enhanced and more visible career prospectsalso contribute to the
building of a positive public attitude towards the researchers’ pro-
fession, and thereby encourage more young people to embarkon
careersin research.
(8) The ultimate politicalgoalofthisRecommendation isto contribute to
the development of an attractive, open and sustainable European
labour marketfor researchers, where the frameworkconditionsallow
for recruiting and retaining high qualityresearchersin environments
conducive to effective performance and productivity.
(9) Member States should endeavour to offer researchers sustainable
career developmentsystemsatallcareer stages, regardlessoftheir
contractualsituation and ofthe chosen R&D career path, and they

4should endeavour to ensure thatresearchersare treated asprofes-
sionalsand asan integralpartofthe institutionsin which theywork.
(10) Even though Member Stateshave made considerable effortsto over-
come administrative and legalobstaclesto geographicaland inter-
sectoralmobility, manyofthese obstaclesstillremain.
(11) Allformsofmobilityshould be encouraged aspartofa comprehen-
sive human resource policyin R&D atnational, regionaland institu-
tionallevel.
(12) The value ofallformsofmobilityneedsto be fullyrecognised in the
career appraisal and career advancement systems for researchers,
thusguaranteeing thatsuch an experience isconducive to their pro-
fessionaldevelopment.
(13) The development of a consistent career and mobility policy for
researchersto 5and from the European Union should be considered
with regard to the situation in developing countriesand regionswithin
and outside Europe, so thatbuilding research capacitieswithin the
European Union does not occur at the expense of less developed
countriesor regions.
(14) Fundersor employersofresearchersin their role asrecruitersshould
be responsible for providing researcherswith open, transparentand
internationallycomparable selection and recruitmentprocedures.
(15) Societyshould appreciate more fullythe responsibilitiesand the pro-
fessionalism thatresearchersdemonstrate in executing their workat
different stages of their careers and in their multi-faceted role as
knowledge workers, leaders, projectcoordinators, managers, super-
visors, mentors, career advisorsor science communicators.

5(16) ThisRecommendation takesasitspremise thatemployersor funders
ofresearchershave an overriding obligation to ensure thattheymeet
respective national, regionalor sectorallegislation requirements.
(17) ThisRecommendation providesMember States, employers, funders
and researcherswith a valuable instrumentto undertake, on a vo-
luntarybasis, further initiativesfor the improvementand consolidation
ofresearchers’ career prospectsin the European Union and for the
creation ofan open labour marketfor researchers.
(18) The generalprinciplesand requirementsoutlined in thisRecommen-
dation are the fruits of a public consultation process to which the
members of the Steering Group on Human Resources and Mobility
have been fullyassociated,
Herebyrecommends:
1. ThatMember Statesendeavour to undertake the necessarystepsto
ensure thatemployersor fundersofresearchersdevelop and main-
tain a supportive research environmentand working culture, where
individuals and research groups are valued, encouraged and sup-
ported, and provided with the necessarymaterialand intangible sup-
port to enable them to fulfil their objectives and tasks. Within this
context, particular priority should be given to the organisation of
working and training conditionsin the earlystage ofthe researchers’
careers, asitcontributesto the future choicesand attractivenessof
a career in R&D.
2. ThatMember Statesendeavour to take, wherever necessary, the cru-
cialstepsto ensure thatemployersor fundersofresearchersimprove
the recruitmentmethodsand career evaluation/appraisalsystemsin
order to create a more transparent, open, equaland internationally
accepted system of recruitment and career development as a pre-
requisite for a genuine European labour marketfor researchers.
63. That Member States - as they formulate and adopt their strategies
and systemsfor developing sustainable careersfor researchers- take
duly into account and are guided by the general principles and
requirements, referred to asThe European Charter for Researchers
and the Code ofConductfor the RecruitmentofResearchersoutlined
in the Annex.
4. ThatMember Statesendeavour to transpose these generalprinciples
and requirementswithin their area ofresponsibilityinto nationalre-
gulatoryframeworksor sectoraland/or institutionalstandardsand
guidelines(chartersand/or codesfor researchers). In so doing they
should take into accountthe greatdiversityofthe laws, regulations
and practiceswhich, in differentcountriesand in differentsectors,
determine the path, organisation and working conditionsofa career
in R&D.
5. That Member States consider such general principles and require-
ments as an integral part of institutional quality assurance mecha-
nismsbyregarding them asa meansfor establishing funding criteria
for national/regionalfunding schemes, aswellasadopting them for
the auditing, monitoring and evaluation processesofpublicbodies.
6. ThatMember Statescontinue their effortsto overcome the persisting
legaland administrative obstaclesto mobility, including those related
to intersectoral mobility and mobility between and within different
functions, taking into accountan enlarged European Union.
7. ThatMember Statesendeavour to ensure thatresearchersenjoyade-
quate socialsecuritycoverage according to their legalstatus. Within
thiscontext, particular attention should be paid to the portabilityof
pension rights, either statutory or supplementary, for researchers
moving within the publicand private sectorsin the same countryand
also for those moving across borders within the European Union.
Such regimesshould guarantee thatresearcherswho, in the course
7oftheir lives, change jobsor interrupttheir careersdo notundulysuf-
fer a lossofsocialsecurityrights.
8. ThatMember Statesputin place the necessarymonitoring structures
to review thisRecommendation regularly, aswellasto measure the
extentto which employers, fundersand researchershave applied the
European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the
RecruitmentofResearchers.
9. That the criteria for measuring this will be established and agreed
with the Member Stateswithin the contextofthe workundertaken by
the Steering Group on Human Resourcesand Mobility.
10. That Member States in their role as representatives in the interna-
tionalorganisationsestablished atintergovernmentalleveltake due
accountofthisRecommendation when proposing strategiesand tak-
ing decisionsconcerning the activitiesofthose organisations.
11. This Recommendation is addressed to the Member States but it is
also intended asan instrumentto encourage socialdialogue, aswell
asdialogue among researchers, stakeholdersand societyatlarge.
12. The Member Statesare invited to inform the Commission, asfar as
possible, by 15th December 2005 and annually thereafter of any
measures they have taken further to this Recommendation, and to
inform it of the first results of its application as well as to provide
examplesofgood practice.
13. ThisRecommendation willbe reviewed periodicallybythe Commis-
sion in the contextofthe Open Method ofCoordination.

8ANNEX
Section 1
The European CharterforResearchers
The European Charter for Researchersisa setofgeneralprinciplesand
requirementswhich specifiesthe roles, responsibilitiesand entitlements
of researchers as well as of employers and/or funders of researchers6.
The aim of the Charter is to ensure that the nature of the relationship
between researchersand employersor fundersisconducive to successful
performance in generating, transferring, sharing and disseminating
knowledge and technological development, and to the career develop-
mentofresearchers. The Charter also recognizesthe value ofallformsof
mobility as a means for enhancing the professional development of
researchers.
In thissense, the Charter constitutesa frameworkfor researchers, employers
and funderswhich invitesthem to actresponsiblyand asprofessionals
within their working environment, and to recognise each other assuch.
The Charter addressesallresearchersin the European Union atallstages
oftheir career and coversallfieldsofresearch in the publicand private
sectors, irrespective ofthe nature ofthe appointmentor employment7, the
legalstatusoftheir employer or the type oforganisation or establishment
in which the workiscarried out. Ittakesinto accountthe multiple rolesof
researchers, who are appointed not only to conduct research and/or to
carryoutdevelopmentactivitiesbutare also involved in supervision, men-
toring, managementor administrative tasks.
6 See definition in Section 3.
7 See definition in Section 3.
9This Charter takes as its premise that researchers as well as employers
and/or fundersofresearchershave an overriding obligation to ensure that
theymeetthe requirementsofthe respective nationalor regionallegisla-
tion. Where researchers enjoy a status and rights which are, in certain
respects, more favourable than those provided for in thisCharter, itsterms
should notbe invoked to diminish the statusand rightsalreadyacquired.
Researchers, aswellasemployersand funders, who adhere to thisChar-
ter willalso be respecting the fundamentalrightsand observe the prin-
ciplesrecognised bythe Charter ofFundamentalRightsofthe European
Union 8.

10General Principles and Requirements
applicable to Researchers:
Research Freedom
Researchersshould focustheir research for the good ofmankind and for
expanding the frontiersofscientificknowledge, while enjoying the free-
dom ofthoughtand expression, and the freedom to identifymethodsby
which problemsare solved, according to recognised ethicalprinciplesand
practices.
Researchers should, however, recognise the limitations to this freedom
thatcould arise asa resultofparticular research circumstances(including
supervision/guidance/management) or operational constraints, e.g. for
budgetaryor infrastructuralreasonsor, especiallyin the industrialsector,
for reasons of intellectual property protection. Such limitations should
not, however, contravene recognised ethicalprinciplesand practices, to
which researchershave to adhere.
Ethicalprinciples
Researchersshould adhere to the recognised ethicalpracticesand fun-
damentalethicalprinciplesappropriate to their discipline(s) aswellasto
ethicalstandardsasdocumented in the differentnational, sectoralor insti-
tutionalCodesofEthics.
Professionalresponsibility
Researchersshould make everyeffortto ensure thattheir research isre-
levantto societyand doesnotduplicate research previouslycarried out
elsewhere.
11Theymustavoid plagiarism ofanykind and abide bythe principle ofintel-
lectualpropertyand jointdata ownership in the case ofresearch carried
out in collaboration with a supervisor(s) and/or other researchers. The
need to validate new observationsbyshowing thatexperimentsare repro-
ducible should notbe interpreted asplagiarism, provided thatthe data to
be confirmed are explicitlyquoted.
Researchersshould ensure, ifanyaspectoftheir workisdelegated, that
the person to whom itisdelegated hasthe competence to carryitout.
Professionalattitude
Researchers should be familiar with the strategic goals governing their
research environmentand funding mechanisms, and should seekallne-
cessaryapprovalsbefore starting their research or accessing the resources
provided.
They should inform their employers, funders or supervisor when their
research projectisdelayed, redefined or completed, or give notice ifitis
to be terminated earlier or suspended for whatever reason.
Contractualand legalobligations
Researchers at all levels must be familiar with the national, sectoral or
institutional regulations governing training and/or working conditions.
This includes Intellectual Property Rights regulations, and the require-
ments and conditions of any sponsor or funders, independently of the
nature oftheir contract. Researchersshould adhere to such regulationsby
delivering the required results(e.g. thesis, publications, patents, reports,
new productsdevelopment, etc) assetoutin the termsand conditionsof
the contractor equivalentdocument.
12Accountability
Researchers need to be aware that they are accountable towards their
employers, fundersor other related publicor private bodiesaswellas, on
more ethical grounds, towards society as a whole. In particular,
researchersfunded bypublicfundsare also accountable for the efficient
use oftaxpayers’ money. Consequently, theyshould adhere to the prin-
ciplesofsound, transparentand efficientfinancialmanagementand co-
operate with anyauthorised auditsoftheir research, whether undertaken
bytheir employers/fundersor byethicscommittees.
Methodsofcollection and analysis, the outputsand, where applicable,
detailsofthe data should be open to internaland externalscrutiny, when-
ever necessaryand asrequested bythe appropriate authorities.
Good practice in research
Researchersshould atalltimesadoptsafe working practices, in line with
nationallegislation, including taking the necessaryprecautionsfor health
and safetyand for recoveryfrom information technologydisasters, e.g. by
preparing proper back-up strategies. Theyshould also be familiar with the
currentnationallegalrequirementsregarding data protection and confi-
dentialityprotection requirements, and undertake the necessarystepsto
fulfilthem atalltimes.
Dissemination, exploitation ofresults
All researchers should ensure, in compliance with their contractual
arrangements, that the results of their research are disseminated and
exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research settingsor,
if appropriate, commercialised. Senior researchers, in particular, are
expected to take a lead in ensuring thatresearch isfruitfuland thatresults
13are either exploited commercially or made accessible to the public (or
both) whenever the opportunityarises.
Publicengagement
Researchersshould ensure thattheir research activitiesare made known
to societyatlarge in such a waythattheycan be understood bynon-spe-
cialists, therebyimproving the public’sunderstanding ofscience. Direct
engagement with the public will help researchers to better understand
publicinterestin prioritiesfor science and technologyand also the pub-
lic’sconcerns.
Relation with supervisors
Researchersin their training phase should establish a structured and re-
gular relationship with their supervisor(s) and faculty/departmentalrep-
resentative(s) so asto take fulladvantage oftheir relationship with them.
Thisincludeskeeping recordsofallworkprogressand research findings,
obtaining feedbackbymeansofreportsand seminars, applying such feed-
backand working in accordance with agreed schedules, milestones, deliv-
erablesand/or research outputs.
Supervision and managerialduties
Senior researchersshould devote particular attention to their multi-faceted
role assupervisors, mentors, career advisors, leaders, projectcoordina-
tors, managers or science communicators. They should perform these
tasksto the highestprofessionalstandards. With regard to their role as
supervisorsor mentorsofresearchers, senior researchersshould build up
a constructive and positive relationship with the early-stage researchers,
in order to setthe conditionsfor efficienttransfer ofknowledge and for the
further successfuldevelopmentofthe researchers’ careers.
14Continuing ProfessionalDevelopment
Researchersatallcareer stagesshould seekto continuallyimprove them-
selvesbyregularlyupdating and expanding their skillsand competencies.
Thismaybe achieved bya varietyofmeansincluding, butnotrestricted to,
formaltraining, workshops, conferencesand e-learning.
15General Principles and Requirements applicable to Employers and
Funders:
Recognition ofthe profession
Allresearchersengaged in a research career should be recognised aspro-
fessionals and be treated accordingly. This should commence at the
beginning of their careers, namely at postgraduate level, and should
include alllevels, regardlessoftheir classification atnationallevel(e.g.
employee, postgraduate student, doctoralcandidate, postdoctoralfellow,
civilservants).
Non-discrimination
Employers and/or funders of researchers will not discriminate against
researchers in any way on the basis of gender, age, ethnic, national or
social origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation, language, disability,
politicalopinion, socialor economiccondition.
Research environment
Employers and/or funders of researchers should ensure that the most
stimulating research or research training environment is created which
offersappropriate equipment, facilitiesand opportunities, including for
remote collaboration over research networks, and thatthe nationalor sec-
toralregulationsconcerning health and safetyin research are observed.
Fundersshould ensure thatadequate resourcesare provided in supportof
the agreed workprogramme.
16Working conditions
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thatthe working conditionsfor
researchers, including for disabled researchers, provide where appropri-
ate the flexibilitydeemed essentialfor successfulresearch performance in
accordance with existing nationallegislation and with nationalor sectoral
collective-bargaining agreements. They should aim to provide working
conditionswhich allow both women and men researchersto combine fam-
ilyand work, children and career 9. Particular attention should be paid,
interalia, to flexible working hours, part-time working, tele-working and
sabbaticalleave, aswellasto the necessaryfinancialand administrative
provisionsgoverning such arrangements.
Stabilityand permanence ofemployment
Employers and/or funders should ensure that the performance of
researchersisnotundermined byinstabilityofemploymentcontracts, and
should therefore committhemselvesasfar aspossible to improving the
stability of employment conditions for researchers, thus implementing
and abiding bythe principlesand termslaid down in the EU Directive on
Fixed-Term Work10.
9 See SEC(2005) 260, Women and Science: Excellence and Innovation – Gender Equalityin
Science.
10 Which aimsto preventfixed-term employeesfrom being treated lessfavourablythan similar
permanentemployees, to preventabuse arising from the use ofsuccessive fixed-term con-
tracts, to improve accessto training for fixed-term employeesand to ensure thatfixed-term
employeesare informed aboutavailable permanentjobs. CouncilDirective 1999/70/ECcon-
cerning the “FrameworkAgreementon fixed-term work” concluded byETUC, UNICEand CEEP,
adopted on 28 June 1999.
17Funding and salaries
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould ensure thatresearchers
enjoyfair and attractive conditionsoffunding and/or salarieswith ade-
quate and equitable social security provisions (including sickness and
parentalbenefits, pension rightsand unemploymentbenefits) in accor-
dance with existing nationallegislation and with nationalor sectoralcol-
lective bargaining agreements. Thismustinclude researchersatallcareer
stagesincluding early-stage researchers, commensurate with their legal
status, performance and levelofqualificationsand/or responsibilities.
Gender balance 11
Employersand/or fundersshould aim for a representative gender balance
atalllevelsofstaff, including atsupervisoryand manageriallevel. This
should be achieved on the basisofan equalopportunitypolicyatrecruit-
mentand atthe subsequentcareer stageswithout, however, taking prece-
dence over qualityand competence criteria. To ensure equaltreatment,
selection and evaluation committees should have an adequate gender
balance.
Career development
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould draw up, preferablywithin
the frameworkoftheir human resourcesmanagement, a specificcareer
developmentstrategyfor researchersatallstagesoftheir career, regard-
lessoftheir contractualsituation, including for researcherson fixed-term
contracts. Itshould include the availabilityofmentorsinvolved in provi-
ding supportand guidance for the personaland professionaldevelopment
of researchers, thus motivating them and contributing to reducing any
11 See SEC(2005) 260, Women and Science: Excellence and Innovation – Gender Equalityin
Science.
18insecurity in their professional future. All researchers should be made
familiar with such provisionsand arrangements.
Value ofmobility
Employersand/or fundersmustrecognise the value ofgeographical, inter-
sectoral, inter- and trans-disciplinaryand virtual12mobilityaswellasmobi-
lity between the public and private sector as an important means of
enhancing scientificknowledge and professionaldevelopmentatanystage
ofa researcher’scareer. Consequently, theyshould build such optionsinto
the specificcareer developmentstrategyand fullyvalue and acknowledge
anymobilityexperience within their career progression/appraisalsystem.
Thisalso requiresthatthe necessaryadministrative instrumentsbe putin
place to allow the portabilityofboth grantsand socialsecurityprovisions,
in accordance with nationallegislation.
Accessto research training and continuousdevelopment
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thatallresearchersatanystage
of their career, regardless of their contractual situation, are given the
opportunityfor professionaldevelopmentand for improving their employ-
abilitythrough accessto measuresfor the continuing developmentofskills
and competencies.
Such measuresshould be regularlyassessed for their accessibility, take-
up and effectivenessin improving competencies, skillsand employability.
12 i.e. remote collaboration over electronicnetworks.
19Accessto career advice
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thatcareer advice and job place-
mentassistance, either in the institutionsconcerned, or through collabo-
ration with other structures, isoffered to researchersatallstagesoftheir
careers, regardlessoftheir contractualsituation.
IntellectualPropertyRights
Employers and/or funders should ensure that researchers at all career
stagesreap the benefitsofthe exploitation (ifany) oftheir R&D results
through legal protection and, in particular, through appropriate protec-
tion ofIntellectualPropertyRights, including copyrights.
Policies and practices should specify what rights belong to researchers
and/or, where applicable, to their employersor other parties, including
externalcommercialor industrialorganisations, aspossiblyprovided for
under specificcollaboration agreementsor other typesofagreement.
Co-authorship
Co-authorship should be viewed positivelybyinstitutionswhen evaluating
staff, asevidence ofa constructive approach to the conductofresearch.
Employersand/or fundersshould therefore develop strategies, practices
and proceduresto provide researchers, including those atthe beginning
oftheir research careers, with the necessaryframeworkconditionsso that
theycan enjoythe rightto be recognised and listed and/or quoted, in the
contextoftheir actualcontributions, asco-authorsofpapers, patents, etc,
or to publish their own research resultsindependentlyfrom their supervi-
sor(s).
20Supervision
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thata person isclearlyidentified
to whom early-stage researcherscan refer for the performance oftheir pro-
fessionalduties, and should inform the researchersaccordingly.
Such arrangementsshould clearlydefine thatthe proposed supervisors
are sufficientlyexpertin supervising research, have the time, knowledge,
experience, expertise and commitment to be able to offer the research
trainee appropriate supportand provide for the necessaryprogressand
review procedures, aswellasthe necessaryfeedbackmechanisms.
Teaching
Teaching isan essentialmeansfor the structuring and dissemination of
knowledge and should therefore be considered a valuable option within
the researchers’ career paths. However, teaching responsibilitiesshould
notbe excessive and should notpreventresearchers, particularlyatthe
beginning oftheir careers, from carrying outtheir research activities.
Employers and/or funders should ensure that teaching duties are ade-
quatelyremunerated and taken into accountin the evaluation/appraisal
systems, and thattime devoted bysenior membersofstaffto the training
ofearlystage researchersshould be counted aspartoftheir teaching com-
mitment. Suitable training should be provided for teaching and coaching
activitiesaspartofthe professionaldevelopmentofresearchers.
Evaluation/appraisalsystems
Employersand/or fundersshould introduce for allresearchers, including
senior researchers, evaluation/appraisalsystemsfor assessing their pro-
fessionalperformance on a regular basisand in a transparentmanner by
an independent(and, in the case ofsenior researchers, preferablyinter-
national) committee.
21Such evaluation and appraisal procedures should take due account of
their overall research creativity and research results, e.g. publications,
patents, managementofresearch, teaching/lecturing, supervision, men-
toring, nationalor internationalcollaboration, administrative duties, pub-
lic awareness activities and mobility, and should be taken into
consideration in the contextofcareer progression.
Complaints/appeals
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould establish, in compliance
with nationalrulesand regulations, appropriate procedures, possiblyin
the form of an impartial (ombudsman-type) person to deal with com-
plaints/appeals of researchers, including those concerning conflicts
between supervisor(s) and early-stage researchers. Such procedures
should provide allresearch staffwith confidentialand informalassistance
in resolving work-related conflicts, disputesand grievances, with the aim
of promoting fair and equitable treatment within the institution and
improving the overallqualityofthe working environment.
Participation in decision-making bodies
Employers and/or funders of researchers should recognise it as wholly
legitimate, and indeed desirable, thatresearchersbe represented in the
relevantinformation, consultation and decision-making bodiesofthe insti-
tutionsfor which theywork, so asto protectand promote their individual
and collective interestsasprofessionalsand to activelycontribute to the
workingsofthe institution 13.
13 In thiscontextsee also EU Directive 2002/14/EC.
22Recruitment
Employers and/or funders should ensure that the entry and admission
standardsfor researchers, particularlyatthe beginning attheir careers, are
clearly specified and should also facilitate access for disadvantaged
groupsor for researchersreturning to a research career, including teachers
(ofanylevel) returning to a research career.
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould adhere to the principles
setoutin the Code ofConductfor the RecruitmentofResearcherswhen
appointing or recruiting researchers.
23Section 2
The Code ofConductforthe RecruitmentofResearchers
The code ofconductfor the recruitmentofresearchersconsistsofa setof
generalprinciplesand requirementsthatshould be followed byemployers
and/or funders when appointing or recruiting researchers. These prin-
ciples and requirements should ensure observance of values such as
transparencyofthe recruitmentprocessand equaltreatmentofallappli-
cants, in particular with regard to the developmentofan attractive, open
and sustainable European labour market for researchers, and are com-
plementary to those outlined in the European Charter for Researchers.
Institutionsand employersadhering to the Code ofConductwillopenly
demonstrate their commitment to act in a responsible and respectable
wayand to provide fair frameworkconditionsto researchers, with a clear
intention to contribute to the advancementofthe European Research Area.
General Principles and Requirements for the Code of Conduct
Recruitment
Employersand/or fundersshould establish recruitmentprocedureswhich
are open 14, efficient, transparent, supportive and internationallycompa-
rable, aswellastailored to the type ofpositionsadvertised.
14 Allavailable instrumentsshould be used, in particular internationalor globallyaccessible
web-based resources such as the pan-European Researcher’s Mobility Portal:
http://europa.eu.int/eracareers.
24Advertisementsshould give a broad description ofknowledge and com-
petencies required, and should not be so specialised as to discourage
suitable applicants. Employersshould include a description ofthe working
conditions and entitlements, including career development prospects.
Moreover, the time allowed between the advertisementofthe vacancyor
the callfor applicationsand the deadline for replyshould be realistic.
Selection
Selection committeesshould bring together diverse expertise and compe-
tencesand should have an adequate gender balance and, where appropri-
ate and feasible, include membersfrom differentsectors(publicand private)
and disciplines, including from other countriesand with relevantexperience

Transparency
Candidatesshould be informed, prior to the selection, aboutthe recruitment
processand the selection criteria, the number ofavailable positionsand the
career developmentprospects. Theyshould also be informed after the selec-
tion processaboutthe strengthsand weaknessesoftheir applications.
Judging merit
The selection processshould take into consideration the whole range of
experience 15ofthe candidates. While focusing on their overallpotentialas
researchers, their creativity and level of independence should also be
considered.

thisdocument.
25Thismeansthatmeritshould be judged qualitativelyaswellasquantita-
tively, focusing on outstanding resultswithin a diversified career path and
notonlyon the number ofpublications. Consequently, the importance of
bibliometricindicesshould be properlybalanced within a wider range of
evaluation criteria, such asteaching, supervision, teamwork, knowledge
transfer, managementofresearch and innovation and publicawareness
activities. For candidatesfrom an industrialbackground, particular attention
should be paid to anycontributionsto patents, developmentor inventions.
Variationsin the chronologicalorder ofCVs
Career breaksor variationsin the chronologicalorder ofCVsshould notbe
penalised, butregarded asan evolution ofa career, and consequently, as
a potentiallyvaluable contribution to the professional development of
researcherstowardsa multidimensionalcareer track. Candidatesshould
therefore be allowed to submit evidence-based CVs, reflecting a repre-
sentative arrayofachievementsand qualificationsappropriate to the post
for which application isbeing made.
Recognition ofmobilityexperience
Anymobilityexperience, e.g. a stayin another country/region or in another
research setting (publicor private) or a change from one discipline or sector
to another, whether aspartofthe initialresearch training or ata later stage
ofthe research career, or virtualmobilityexperience, should be considered
asa valuable contribution to the professionaldevelopmentofa researcher.
Recognition ofqualifications
Employersand/or fundersshould provide for appropriate assessmentand
evaluation ofthe academicand professionalqualifications, including non-
formalqualifications, ofallresearchers, in particular within the contextof
26internationaland professionalmobility. Theyshould inform themselves
and gain a fullunderstanding ofrules, proceduresand standardsgover-
ning the recognition of such qualifications and, consequently, explore
existing nationallaw, conventionsand specificruleson the recognition of
these qualificationsthrough allavailable channels16.
Seniority
The levelsofqualificationsrequired should be in line with the needsofthe
position and notbe setasa barrier to entry. Recognition and evaluation
ofqualificationsshould focuson judging the achievementsofthe person
rather than his/her circumstancesor the reputation ofthe institution where
the qualifications were gained. As professional qualifications may be
gained atan earlystage ofa long career, the pattern oflifelong profes-
sionaldevelopmentshould also be recognised.
Postdoctoralappointments
Clear rulesand explicitguidelinesfor the recruitmentand appointmentof
postdoctoralresearchers, including the maximum duration and the objec-
tives of such appointments, should be established by the institutions
appointing postdoctoral researchers. Such guidelines should take into
accounttime spentin prior postdoctoralappointmentsatother institutions
and take into consideration that the postdoctoral status should be
transitional, with the primarypurpose ofproviding additionalprofessional
development opportunities for a research career in the context of long-
term career prospects.

KI-NA-21620-EN-C The European Commission has adopted the European Charter for
Researchers and a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of
Researchers. These two documents are key elements in the EU’s
policy to make research an attractive career, which is a vital
feature of its strategy to stimulate economic and employment
growth. The Charter and Code of Conduct will give individual
researchers the same rights and obligations wherever they may
work throughout the EU. This should help counter the fact that
research careers in Europe are fragmented at local, regional,
national or sectoral level, and allow Europe to make the most of
its scientific potential.EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024

Critical risk A critical risk is a plausible event or issue that could have a high adverse impact
on the ability of the project to achieve its objectives. Level of likelihood to occur
(Low/medium/high): The likelihood is the estimated probability that the risk will
materialise even after taking account of the mitigating measures put in place.
Level of severity (Low/medium/high): The relative seriousness of the risk and
the significance of its effect.
Deliverable A report that is sent to the Commission or Agency providing information to
ensure effective monitoring of the project. There are different types of
deliverables (e.g. a report on specific activities or results, data management
plans, ethics or security requirements).
Impacts Wider long term effects on society (including the environment), the economy
and science, enabled by the outcomes of R&I investments (long term). It refers
to the specific contribution of the project to the work programme expected
impacts described in the destination. Impacts generally occur some time after
the end of the project. Example: The deployment of the advanced forecasting
system enables each airport to increase maximum passenger capacity by 15%
and passenger average throughput by 10%, leading to a 28% reduction in
infrastructure expansion costs.
Milestone Control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may
correspond to the achievement of a key result, allowing the next phase of the
work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if
problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a
critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must
decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development. The
achievement of a milestone should be verifiable.
Objectives The goals of the work performed within the project, in terms of its research and
innovation content. This will be translated into the project’s activities. These
may range from tackling specific research questions, demonstrating the
feasibility of an innovation, sharing knowledge among stakeholders on specific
issues. The nature of the objectives will depend on the type of action, and the
scope of the topic.
Outcomes The expected effects, over the medium term, of projects supported under a
given topic. The results of a project should contribute to these outcomes,
fostered in particular by the dissemination and exploitation measures (including
the uptake, diffusion, deployment, and/or use of the project’s results by direct
target groups). Outcomes generally occur during or shortly after the end of the
project. Example: 9 European airports adopt the advanced forecasting system
demonstrated during the project.
Pathway to Logical steps towards the achievement of the expected impacts of the project
impact over time, in particular beyond the duration of a project. A pathway begins with
the projects’ results, to their dissemination, exploitation and communication,
contributing to the expected outcomes in the work programme topic, and
ultimately to the wider scientific, economic and societal impacts of the work
programme destination.
Research Results generated by the action to which access can be given in the form of
7EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
output scientific publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such
as software, algorithms, protocols and electronic notebooks.
Results What is generated during the project implementation. This may include, for
example, know-how, innovative solutions, algorithms, proof of feasibility, new
business models, policy recommendations, guidelines, prototypes,
demonstrators, databases and datasets, trained researchers, new
infrastructures, networks, etc. Most project results (inventions, scientific works,
etc) are ‘Intellectual Property’, which may, if appropriate, be protected by
formal ‘Intellectual Property Rights’. Example: Successful large-scale
demonstrator: trial with 3 airports of an advanced forecasting system for
proactive airport passenger flow management.
Horizon Europe is divided into three pillars and one part, corresponding to its main
priorities
• The Excellent Science pillar aims to increase the EU’s global scientific
competitiveness. It supports frontier research projects defined and driven by top
researchers themselves through the European Research Council, funds
fellowships for postdoctoral researchers, doctoral training networks and
exchanges for researchers through Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, and invests
in world-class research infrastructures.
• The Global Challenges and European Industrial Competiveness pillar supports
research relating to societal challenges and reinforces technological and
industrial capacities through clusters. It sets EU-missions with ambitious goals
tackling some of our biggest problems. It also includes activities pursued by the
Joint Research Centre which supports EU and national policymakers with
independent scientific evidence and technical support.
• The Innovative Europe pillar aims to make Europe a frontrunner in market-
creating innovation via the European Innovation Council. It also helps to develop
8EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
the overall European innovation landscape through the European Institute of
Innovation and Technology (EIT) which fosters the integration of the knowledge
triangle of education, research and innovation.
• The part Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area
(ERA) increase support to EU Member States in their efforts to make the most of
their national research and innovation potential.
Finally, Horizon Europe will be implemented also through the European Defence Fund
and complemented by the Euratom Research and Training Programme.
Horizon Europe will have a budget of around €95.5 billion for 2021-2027 (current
prices). This includes €5.4 billion (current prices) from NextGenerationEU to boost
recovery and make the EU more resilient for the future, as well as an additional
reinforcement (i.e. in addition to the MFF agreement in July 2020) of €4.6 billion
(current prices).
The Horizon Europe strategic plan sets out overarching strategic orientations for EU
research and innovation investments over the period 2021-2024. Focusing on the
second pillar of Horizon Europe, 'Global challenges and European industrial
competitiveness', it also covers relevant activities in the first pillar, ‘Excellent Science’,
and the third pillar, ‘Innovative Europe’, and the ‘Widening Participation and
Strengthening the European Research Area’ part.
Overall, the aim of the strategic plan is to ensure an effective interface between EU
policy priorities, and programme activities and ultimately, the research and innovation
projects funded by Horizon Europe. The intention is to stimulate research and
innovation investments where they are particularly needed to address the challenges
we are facing, and, most importantly, deliver results.
The Horizon Europe strategic plan defines four key strategic orientations:
• Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of
key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value
chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-
centred technologies and innovations.
• Restoring Europe’s ecosystems and biodiversity, and managing
sustainably natural resources to ensure food security and a clean and healthy
environment.
• Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and
sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy,
construction and production systems.
• Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society,
prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and
providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the
green and digital transitions.
Each of the key strategic orientations encompasses three to four cross-cutting impact
areas, which in turn link to a number of expected impacts. The key strategic
orientations and impact areas are formulated on the basis of the expected impacts,
which have been defined with input from stakeholders, largely bottom-up, during the
strategic planning process. The expected impacts are structured by the six clusters
that make up Horizon Europe’s second Pillar, ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial
9EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Competitiveness’. The expected impacts define the wider effects on society, the
economy and science to be targeted by research and innovation activities, but not the
manner in which to achieve them. This is up to the applicants when designing their
project proposals. In total, the strategic plan defines 32 expected impacts that cover a
wide range of social, economic, ecological and scientific aspirations. Each expected
impact serves as the foundation for a corresponding destination in the relevant work
programme parts.
Furthermore, the strategic plan identifies European co-programmed and co-funded
partnerships, as well as the EU missions and contains orientations regarding cross-
cutting elements of Horizon Europe related to areas for international cooperation,
and key specific issues, such as gender, social sciences and humanities
integration, key enabling technologies, ethics, open science practices, as well
as social innovation and the EU taxonomy.
The Horizon Europe strategic plan is the product of a series of intense co-creation
activities among Commission services and co-design activities with Member States,
members of the European Parliament, stakeholders and citizens at large. This has taken
place through successive rounds of public consultations, web surveys and interactive
workshops, in particular during the annual Research and Innovation Days.
The impact-driven design of Horizon Europe1 aims at maximising the effects of Research
and Innovation investments, ensuring their contribution to the Commission’s policy
priorities.
It marks a paradigm change in the design of the EU R&I Framework Programmes from
an activity-driven to an impact-driven programme.
One of the novelties in the implementation of the Horizon Europe programme which
facilitates such an impact-driven approach is the strategic planning process (as
described above), which identifies the expected impacts of the first four years of
Horizon Europe.
This represents a paradigm change also for the work programmes, that henceforth
builds on this strategic planning. The structure of Horizon Europe work programmes
translates this impact-driven nature: they are organised around ‘Destinations’,
describing the expected impacts identified in the Strategic Planning, and ‘topics’,
describing the related expected outcomes critical to the achievement of such impacts.
This impact design is also translated at project level, with revamped proposal and
reporting templates, allowing for a straightforward monitoring that aims at providing
close-to-real-time information.
Horizon Europe ground breaking approach to monitoring, the Key Impact Pathways2,
aims at capturing and communicating impact around 9 key story lines during and after
the programme implementation. Its objective is to allow policy makers and the wider
public to get regular insights regarding the effects and benefits of the programme on
European science, the economy and wider society3.

European Partnerships bring the Commission and private and/or public partners
together to address some of Europe’s most pressing challenges through concerted
research and innovation initiatives. They are a key implementation tool of Horizon
Europe, and contribute significantly to achieving the EU’s political priorities.
By bringing private and public partners together, European Partnerships help to avoid
the duplication of investments and contribute to reducing the fragmentation of the
research and innovation landscape in the EU.
Find out more about European Partnerships: European Partnerships in Horizon Europe -
European Commission (europa.eu).
The aim of European partnerships with EU and associated countries, the private sector,
foundations and other stakeholders is to deliver on global challenges and modernise
industry.
The Horizon Europe proposal lays down the conditions and principles for establishing
European Partnerships. There are 3 types:
• European Co-programme Partnerships
These are partnerships between the Commission and private and/or public
partners. They are based on memoranda of understanding.
• European Co-funded Partnerships
Partnerships involving EU countries, with research funders and other public
authorities at the core of the consortium.
• European Institutionalised Partnerships
These are partnerships in the field of research and innovation between the
Union, EU member states and/or industry. These partnerships require legislative
proposals from the Commission and are based on a Council Regulation (on the
basis of Article 187 TFEU) or a Decision by the European Parliament and Council
(on the basis of Article 185 TFEU). They are implemented by dedicated
structures created for that purpose. Institutionalised partnerships will only be
implemented where other parts of the Horizon Europe programme, including
other types of partnership, would not achieve the desired objectives or expected
impacts. EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) are also
institutionalised partnerships. EIT KICs aim to address skills shortages and are
already established under Horizon 2020. Key partners in EIT KICs are higher
education institutions, research organisations, companies and other
stakeholders.

EU missions are commitments to solve some of the greatest challenges facing our
world like fighting cancer, adapting to climate change, protecting our oceans, living in
11EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
greener cities and ensuring soil health and food. They are an integral part of Horizon
Europe.
Each mission will operate as a portfolio of actions – such as research projects, policy
measures or even legislative initiatives - to achieve a measurable goal that could not be
achieved through individual actions. EU missions will contribute to the goals of the
European Green Deal, Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan as well as the Sustainable
Development Goals. A wide range of studies and reports informed this approach
(Mission-oriented policy studies and reports - European Commission (europa.eu)).
EU missions will:
• be bold, inspirational and widely relevant to society
• be clearly framed: targeted, measurable and time-bound
• establish impact-driven but realistic goals
• mobilise resources on EU, national and local levels
• link activities across different disciplines and different types of research and
innovation
• make it easier for citizens to understand the value of investments in research
and innovation
Areas where there will be missions:
• Cancer
• Adaptation to climate change including societal transformation
• Healthy oceans, seas coastal and inland waters
• Climate-neutral and smart cities
• Soil health and food

In the context of Horizon Europe, international cooperation is about cooperation with
legal entities established in non-EU countries (third countries). A non-EU country is any
country or territory that is neither an EU Member State nor an overseas country or
territory linked to an EU Member State. Non-EU countries are either associated or not
associated to the Horizon Europe programme.
Overseas countries and territories (OCTs) linked to Member States
Legal entities from OCTs can participate and receive funding under equivalent
conditions as legal entities from Member States.
The OCTs (and their linked Member States) are:
Aruba (NL), Bonaire (NL), Curação (NL), French Polynesia (FR), French Southern
and Antarctic Territories (FR), Greenland (DK), New Caledonia (FR), Saba (NL),
12EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Saint Barthélemy (FR), Sint Eustatius (NL), Sint Maarten (NL), St. Pierre and
Miquelon (FR), Wallis and Futuna Islands (FR).
Third countries associated to Horizon Europe
Association to Horizon Europe is governed by the Horizon Europe Regulation 2021/6954.
Legal entities from associated countries can participate under equivalent conditions as
legal entities from the EU Member States, unless specific limitations or conditions are
laid down in the work programme and/or call/topic text. Such measures could include
the limitation of participation in certain actions to legal entities established in the EU
alone, or in the EU and specified non-EU countries, in order to safeguard the EU’s
strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security. Limitations or conditions may also be
attached to the participation of legal entities established in an eligible country but which
are controlled directly or indirectly by an ineligible country5. The eligibility will be clearly
defined in the work programme. There could also be criteria on the place of
establishment of the legal entity to take into account specific policy requirements or the
nature and objectives of the action6.
Association to Horizon Europe takes place through the conclusion of an international
agreement between the EU and the non-EU country. All sixteen third countries
associated to the previous programme, Horizon 2020, have also expressed interest to
become associated to Horizon Europe. Other third countries have also expressed an
interest in association.
Please see the List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe for an up-to-date list of
countries with which the association agreements have started to produce legal effects
(either through provisional application or their entry into force).
Until association agreements start producing legal effects either through provisional
application or their entry into force, transitional arrangement may apply if provided for
in the particular Horizon Europe work programme. The transitional arrangements apply
with regard to the countries and legal entities established in these countries, with which
association negotiations are being processed or where association is imminent (see List
of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe).
The list is regularly updated to reflect the status of the negotiations for association.
Third countries associated to Euratom Research and Training Programme
For the Euratom Research and Training Programme,similar rules concerning the
transitional arrangement apply. The list of participating countries contains a separate
list with the participating countries to the Euratom Research and Training Programme.
Other third countries
Most Horizon Europe calls are also open to participants from non-associated countries
and international organisations, unless specific limitations or conditions are laid down in
the work programme and/or the call/topic text, such as those described for associated
countries above.
Moreover, some Horizon Europe calls are particularly relevant for international
cooperation, encouraging or even requiring the participation of entities from non-
4 Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing
Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for
participation and dissemination, and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1290/2013 and (EU) No 1291/2013
(OJ 12.5.2021 L 170/1).

associated non-EU countries in the funded actions. Such calls and topics can be found
by using the filter ‘Quick search on specific priorities’ on the Funding & Tenders Portal
search page (e.g. Africa, Mediterranean).
Participants from non-associated non-EU countries can take part in Horizon Europe
actions — but not always with funding.
For the up-to-date list of low to middle income countries in which entities have to be
established to be automatically eligible for funding, please see the List of
Participating Countries in Horizon Europe.
Participants from other countries (i.e. countries that are neither EU Member States, nor
countries associated to Horizon Europe, nor countries listed above) are not
automatically eligible for funding and therefore by default have to participate at their
own cost. These participants should explain in the proposal how their funding will be
secured.
They can however receive exceptional funding, if:
• their country is explicitly identified in the Horizon Europe work programme and
call for proposals as being eligible for funding
• the granting authority considers that their participation as a beneficiary is
essential for implementing the project, for example in view of their:
o outstanding competence/expertise
o access to particular research infrastructures
o access to particular geographical environments
o access to particular data.
In addition, a number of non-EU/non-associated countries that are not automatically
eligible for funding have made specific provisions for national financing mechanisms for
their participants in Horizon Europe projects. For more information, see Horizon Europe
Complementary funding mechanisms in third countries.
Innovation Actions —In accordance with the 2019 “EU-China - A Strategic outlook”
communication, the 2021 “Global Approach to Research and Innovation”
communication, and the joint conclusions of the 4th EU-China Innovation Cooperation
Dialogue of 2019, an exercise to develop a Joint Roadmap for the future of EU-China
cooperation in science, technology, and innovation (Roadmap) has been established
between the EU and China. It has the objective to develop a level playing field for
engagement between the EU and China in the areas of science, technology, and
innovation (STI) that is respectful of fundamental research and innovation values and
principles. This endeavor is to be achieved through an agreement on the framework
conditions contained in the Roadmap and their monitoring and evaluation. As progress
so far has mainly taken place on the framework conditions linked to research rather
than on those related to innovation, and taking into account the nature and objectives
in particular of Innovation Actions, cooperation with entities established in China needs
to be calibrated accordingly.
Legal entities established in China are therefore not eligible to participate in Horizon
Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries,
affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions,
subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may
be granted on a caseby-case basis for justified reasons. The above eligibility condition
may be reviewed in the future in accordance with policy developments. This exclusion is
justified under Article 22(6) of the Horizon Europe Regulation given the substantive
14EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
concerns regarding the use of intellectual property generated under this publicly funded
programme, and the ongoing discussions between China and the EU on the Joint
Roadmap for the future of EU-China cooperation in science, technology, and innovation.
Restrictions on participation or control — For actions related to EU strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security, the specific topic conditions may limit participation to
legal entities established only in EU Member States or in EU Member States and specific
associated or non-associated third countries. In addition, for duly justified and
exceptional reasons, to guarantee protection of the strategic interests of the EU and its
Member States, the specific call conditions may also exclude the participation of legal
entities directly or indirectly controlled by non-eligible third countries or by legal entities
of non-eligible third countries (or make their participation subject to specific
conditions), in line with Article 22(5) of the Horizon Europe Regulation. In this case, the
eligible countries will be identified in the specific call conditions.
EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article
29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU (TFEU)7 as well as Article 75 TFEU8, are not eligible to participate
in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third
parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to
third parties (if any).
Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled
territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the
involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the
implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established
in Russia, Belarus, or in nongovernment controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore,
even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities
are not eligible to participate in any capacity9. This includes participation as
beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind
contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
International organisations
International European research organisations are automatically eligible to receive
funding from Horizon Europe. International European research organisations are defined
as international organisations, the majority of whose members are EU Member States
or associated countries, and whose principal objective is to promote scientific and
technological cooperation in Europe.
For what concerns participation in Horizon Europe actions, international European
research organisations are deemed to be established in a Member State other than the
ones in which the other legal entities participating in the action are established.
As regards all other international organisations:
• For European Research Council frontier research actions, training and mobility
actions and when provided for in the work programme, international
organisations with headquarters in a Member State or associated country are

9 However, natural persons established in Russia, Belarus or in non-government controlled territories of
Ukraine may participate in Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions provided that they are not subject to EU
restrictive measures and comply with all other relevant conditions, including the specific eligibility and
other conditions set out in part 2 of the work programme.
15EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
deemed to be established in that Member State or associated country, and thus
automatically eligible for funding from Horizon Europe.
• In all other cases, international organisations are not automatically eligible for
funding from Horizon Europe, and they may exceptionally receive funding only
if:
o they are identified in the relevant Horizon Europe work programme as
being eligible for funding or
o the granting authority considers that their participation is deemed
essential for implementing the action, for example in view of their:
▪ outstanding competence/expertise
▪ access to particular research infrastructures
▪ access to particular geographical environments
▪ access to particular data.
Foreign interference in Research & Innovation
The Commission has published a toolkit for tackling R&I foreign interference. This
document provides a number of recommendations relating to values, governance,
partnerships, and cybersecurity, which are designed to provide support to higher
education institutions and research performing organisations in their international R&I
engagement. All participants in Horizon Europe are recommended to familiarise
themselves with the document, and any equivalent advice that exists at national level,
and to consider their relevance for the proposals they intend to submit.
Horizon Europe sets gender equality as a cross-cutting principle and aims to
eliminate gender inequality and intersecting socio-economic inequalities
throughout research and innovation systems, including by addressing unconscious bias
and systemic structural barriers.
The strengthened provisions for gender equality under Horizon Europe address three
different levels and include the following:
• A new eligibility criterion to get access to Horizon Europe funding: public
bodies, research organisations and higher education establishments from
Member States and associated countries are required, as of calls with deadlines
in 2022, to have in place a gender equality plan (GEP). Details on this
requirement are specified in General Annex B — Eligibility and additional
guidance is available through this webpage, including a link to Frequently Asked
Questions accessible through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
• The integration of the gender dimension into research and innovation
content across the Programme is an operational objective for Horizon Europe,
and becomes a requirement by default.
• Particular attention is being paid to ensuring gender balance, with a target of
50% women in Horizon Europe related advisory bodies such as boards and
expert groups, as well as in evaluation panels. Gender balance among
researchers involved in projects is strongly encouraged as well, and will be
taken into account as a ranking criterion for ex aequo proposals.
16EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Researchers have the possibility to self-identify in proposals and project
reporting according to three gender categories: woman, man, or non-binary.
In addition:
• Specific funding will be made available for actions supporting the development of
inclusive gender equality plans in research and innovation organisations across
Member States and associated countries, under the Widening Participation
and Strengthening the European Research Area Programme Part.
• Specific funding will also be allocated to gender studies and intersectional
research, in particular under Pillar II, Cluster 2 - Culture, Creativity and
Inclusive Society.
• Flagship measures and activities for promoting gender equality are introduced
under Pillar III, in particular through the European Innovation Council (EIC),
including a target of 40% women-led companies invited to pitch their projects in
the Accelerator instrument, a target of 50% women among members of EIC
advisory structures, a dedicated initiative to support women-led deep-tech start-
ups, and the continuation of the EU prize for women innovators.
These strenghtened provisions are also detailed on the Commission’s Gender equality in
research and innovation policy webpage, and summarised in the factsheet Gender
equality: a strengthened commitment in Horizon Europe. A detailed Guidance
document has been developed to support organisations to meet the Horizon Europe GEP
eligibility criterion. Additionally, a dedicated webinar with a focus on GEPs in available
online to help participants comply with the eligibility criterion.
In this Programme Guide, we focus more specifically on the integration of the gender
dimension into research and innovation (R&I) content, and refer the reader to the links
provided above and to the following webinar for further guidance on the other gender
equality aspects addressed in Horizon Europe and to be taken into account by
applicants.
Integration of the gender dimension into R&I content: a requirement under
Horizon Europe
The integration of the gender dimension into R&I content is mandatory. It is a
requirement set by default across all work programmes, destinations and topics, unless
its non-relevance for a specific topic is specified in the topic description, e.g. by the
mention “In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender
analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement”.
This new requirement to integrate the gender dimension by default in R&I content in
projects is recalled in the General Introduction to the Horizon Europe Work Programme,
and in the General Annex D — Award Criteria (for Research and innovation actions,
Innovation actions and Programme co-fund actions) and it is thus reflected in the
corresponding application forms (proposal template) for Research and Innovation
Actions, Innovation Actions and Programme Co-fund Actions under the Excellence
evaluation criterion (under Methodology).
In the proposal template, applicants are invited to describe how the gender dimension
(i.e. sex and/or gender analysis) is taken into account in the project’s R&I content. If
applicants do not consider such a gender dimension to be relevant in their specific
project, they should provide a sound justification, which will be taken into account
during evaluation of the proposal, e.g. with appropriate scientific references.
What does integrating the gender dimension in R&I content mean?
17EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
It is an umbrella term covering the integration of sex and/or gender analysis through
the entire R&I cycle, from the setting of research priorities through defining concepts,
formulating research questions, developing methodologies, gathering and analysing
sex/gender disaggregated data, to evaluating and reporting results and transferring
them to markets into products and innovations which will benefit all citizens and
promote gender equality. Addressing the gender dimension in research and
innovation thus entails taking into account sex and gender in the whole R&I
process. It is different from addressing issues of gender balance and equal
opportunities among the project’s team members or among participants to events (e.g.
conferences) organised by the project.
Definitions of key related terms:
• Sex refers to biology. Sex is determined by several biological features, according to
functions that derive from the chromosomal complement, reproductive organs, or
specific hormones or environmental factors that affect the expression of phenotypic
traits (morphology) in sexually reproducing organisms. In humans, sex refers to the
biological attributes that distinguish male, female, or intersex. In non-human
animals, sex refers to biological attributes that distinguish male, female, or
hermaphrodite. In engineering & product design research, sex includes anatomical
and physiological characteristics that may impact the design of products, systems,
and processes. Sex differences may be relevant for many R&I projects.
• Gender refers to sociocultural norms, identities and relations that categorise people,
structure societies and organisations, and shape behaviours, products, technologies,
environments, and knowledge. Gender attitudes and behaviours are complex and
change across time and place, as cultural norms and values change. How we speak,
our mannerisms, the things we use and our behaviours all signal who we are and
establish rules for interaction. Gender is an organising principle that structures
behaviours, attitudes, physical appearance and habits. We generally consider three
related dimensions of gender: gender norms (socio-cultural expectations of what is
appropriate for women, men or gender-diverse individuals, often relying on gender
stereotypes), gender identities (how individuals or groups perceive and present
themselves in relation to gender norms, with most commonly used categories
including: woman, man, and non-binary or gender-diverse) and gender relations
(how sex and gender shape social interactions in families, schools, workplaces and
public settings, often involving power relations). As such, gender can be an
important aspect of research and design.
• Intersectionality describes overlapping or intersecting categories such as gender,
ethnicity/racial origin, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation and geographic
location, that compound to determine the identities and experiences of individuals.
Researchers and innovators should not consider gender in isolation. Gender
identities, norms and relations both shape and are shaped by other social attributes.
Why is the gender dimension important?
An increasing body of studies shows that the quality, reproducibility and accountability
of research and innovation are affected by not taking into account sex and gender
analysis. And in many fields, it is crucial to explore whether research outcomes may
affect women and men differently. For instance:
• Why do we observe differences between women and men in infection levels and
mortality rates in the COVID-19 pandemic? Does it make sense to study
cardiovascular diseases only on male animals and on men, or osteoporosis only
on women? And did you know that pheromones given off by men experimenters,
but not women, induce a stress response in laboratory mice sufficient to trigger
pain relief?
18EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Did you know that many aspects of taxation have a substantial effect on gender-
related socioeconomic inequalities, but that when designing tax laws,
policymakers still rarely consider gender inequalities?
• Does it make sense to design car safety equipment only on the basis of male
body standards?
• Did you know that almost 3/4 of women Internet users worldwide have
experienced some form of cyberviolence?
• Why do household travel surveys, and thus mobility analysis and transport
planning, underrate trips performed as part of caring work, which are
predominantly undertaken by women?
• Is it ethical to develop AI products that could spread gender and racial biases
due to a lack of diversity in the data used in training AI applications?
• Did you know that climate change is affecting sex determination in a number of
marine species and that certain populations are now at risk of extinction?
Integrating sex and gender analysis into R&I content improves the scientific quality
and societal relevance of the produced knowledge, technologies and
innovation. It:
• adds value to research and innovation in terms of excellence, creativity, rigor,
reproducibility and business opportunities
• helps researchers and innovators question gender norms and stereotypes, and
rethink standards and reference models
• leads to an in-depth understanding of all people’s needs, behaviours, and
attitudes
• contributes to the production of goods and services better suited to new markets
• is crucial to secure Europe’s leadership in science & technology and support
inclusive and sustainable growth.
Therefore, when drafting a proposal, you should in particular:
• Reflect on why sex and/or gender could matter: Think about and present
the ways in which taking into account the gender dimension will provide added
value in terms of creativity, excellence, and return on investment, both from
public and private perspectives.
• Consider the production of new knowledge on gender: Consider what is
already known in your area in terms of the gender dimension (e.g. related
scientific literature) and identify what is missing. In many areas, gender
knowledge still needs to be generated.
• Include sex and gender aspects as part of a multidisciplinary approach:
Reflecting on sex and gender considerations in relation to health, transport,
energy, security, etc. is a great opportunity to foster cooperation between
scientists with gender expertise and others. It helps concepts cross the borders
of scientific fields and encourages research methods to evolve.
• Consider social categories/factors intersecting with sex and gender: the
way a research problem is formulated will determine which intersecting variables
are relevant for analysis. Intersectional research should be designed to
19EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
illuminate the multiplicative effects of different, but interdependent, categories
and factors.
Guidance and concrete examples (including those mentioned above) on how to
better integrate sex and gender based analyses into R&I content under Horizon Europe
have been developed by the Commission’s Expert Group on Gendered Innovations
under the coordination of DG R&I’s Gender Sector.
A full policy report has been prepared and is available to support applicants.
Entitled Gendered Innovations 2: How inclusive analysis contributes to research and
innovation and publicly released by the European Commission on 25 November 2020, it
is available here, through the Europa website dedicated to gender equality policy in
R&I.
The report contains: full definitions of terms; both general and field-specific methods
for sex analysis, gender analysis and intersectional approaches; fifteen case studies
covering health, climate change, energy, agriculture, urban planning, waste
management, transport, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies, taxation,
venture funding, as well as COVID-19; and policy recommendations to address the
global challenges, targeted impacts and key R&I orientations of the six Horizon Europe
Clusters, as well as Mission Areas, and European partnerships.

SSH in the R&I chain
Under Horizon Europe, the effective integration of social SSH in all clusters, including all
Missions and European partnerships, is a principle throughout the programme. The aim
of SSH integration is to improve our assessment of and response to complex societal
issues. Thus, SSH are a key constituent of research and innovation, especially regarding
the twin green and digital transitions.
Therefore, where relevant, the R&I chain should include contributions from SSH
disciplines such as sociology, economics, psychology, political science, history, cultural
sciences or/and the arts. See the list of SSH disciplines below.
Project requirements - SSH flagged topics
Many topics invite contributions from the SSH, often in collaboration with non-SSH
disciplines such as natural and physical sciences, health sciences or technology. These
topics have been 'flagged' and can be found on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Proposals under these topics are expected to integrate the SSH perspective (social,
economic, behavioural, institutional, historical and/or cultural dimensions etc), as
appropriate. Applicants should therefore ensure that:
• contributions from SSH disciplines are integrated throughout their proposed
project, and
• the actions required, participants and disciplines involved as well as the added
value of SSH contributions are clearly stated in the proposal.
The SSH methodologies used in the projects should be described, or if the applicant
consortium considers that SSH is not relevant to their particular proposal, they should
explain why.
Where relevant, applicants are also encouraged to include contributions from the SSH in
a project proposal under any call, even if it is not SSH-flagged.
Evaluation
When evaluating a proposal submitted to a topic that was 'flagged' for SSH
contributions, experts will first refer to the topic description to identify what the
expected contributions are. With this in mind, they will evaluate the contributions from
SSH in the proposal, according to the criteria.
Experts should be mindful that a successful contribution from SSH, depending on the
topic, may require collaboration among various SSH disciplines and/or between SSH
and non-SSH disciplines.
A proposal without a sufficient contribution/integration of SSH research and
competences will receive a lower evaluation score.
Even if proposals do not belong to a topic 'flagged' for SSH contributions, they may
contain contributions from the SSH disciplines, which should be evaluated with other
relevant aspects of the proposal.
21EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
List of SSH disciplines

Innovations originate from many sources. They stem not only from advances in science
and technology, but also from creative uses of existing knowledge and technologies as
well as inventiveness in the non-technical and social spheres.
Social innovation concerns the development of new products, methods, and services for
and with society involving citizens, public authorities, business and industry, and
academia — the Quadruple Helix — in their design, development, and implementation.
Social innovation engages and empowers citizens, enhances the resilience of
communities, increases the relevance, acceptance and uptake of innovation, and helps
foster lasting changes in social practices, therefore acting as a system changer.
It thus helps answering societal and environmental challenges, connecting society with
innovation.
Social Innovation in Horizon Europe
Social innovation has been identified as a cross-cutting specific issue in Horizon Europe
and concerns all programme parts. Indeed, it holds potential to develop solutions
answering at once multiple interconnected challenges. Moreover, embedding social
innovation into the scope of a topic enhances the chances of uptake of the results of the
project by involving intended users from the beginning of the project to listen to them,
understand their needs, and benefit from their knowledge and creativity. Therefore, it
increases the delivery of the outcomes and impact expected from the project.
22EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
In Horizon Europe, social innovation will serve the environmental, economic, digital,
cultural, sovereignty, and democratic priorities set by the von der Leyen Commission.
In particular, social innovation will support changes towards socially, environmentally,
and economically sustainable social practices. More specifically, the integration of social
innovation on Horizon Europe is relevant to address global challenges – including in
areas such as health and care, also in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the twin
green and digital transitions, climate change mitigation and adaptation or citizen
engagement and deliberative democracy.
The above has been reflected by flagging specific topics and encouraging applicants to
consider social innovation as a way to meet the topic’s objectives, and by dedicating
topics to social innovation.

For all activities funded by the EU, the ethical dimension is an integral part of research
from beginning to end, and ethical compliance is seen as pivotal to achieve real
research excellence. There is a clear need to make a thorough ethical evaluation from
the conceptual stage of the proposal not only to respect the legal framework but also to
enhance the quality of the research. Ethical research conduct implies the application of
fundamental ethical principles and legislation to scientific research in all possible
domains of research. This includes the adherence to the highest standards of research
integrity as described in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity.
The process to assess and address the ethical dimension of activities funded under
Horizon Europe is called the Ethics Appraisal Procedure.
Objectives
In addition to the scientific evaluation focusing on the scientific merit, the quality of the
management and the potential impact, the Ethics Appraisal ensures that all research
activities carried out under Horizon Europe are conducted in compliance with
fundamental ethical principles.
Ethics Appraisal Procedure
The Ethics Appraisal Procedure concerns all activities funded in Horizon Europe and
includes the Ethics Review Procedure, conducted before the start of the project, as well
as Ethics Checks, Reviews and Audits conducted during the project.
When preparing a proposal, it is required to conduct an Ethics Self-assessment starting
with the completion of an Ethics Issues Table. You can read further practicalities in
the How to complete your ethics self-assessment guide.
Ethics Review Procedure
All proposals above threshold and considered for funding will undergo an Ethics Review
carried out by independent ethics experts. The Review starts with the Ethics Screening
which can include, in the cases where there is no ethics issue identified in the proposal,
a pre-screening to confirm or not the absence of ethics issues (this check can be
conducted by qualified staff). If appropriate a further analysis called the Ethics
23EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Assessment is conducted. The Ethics Assessment can lead to ethics requirements
that become contractual obligations.
The Ethics Review Procedure focusses on the compliance with ethical rules and
standards, relevant European legislation, international conventions and declarations,
national authorisations and ethics approvals, proportionality of the research methods
and the applicants' awareness of the ethical aspects and social impact of their planned
research.
The ethics review covers issues as:
• human rights and protection of human beings
• animal protection and welfare
• data protection and privacy
• health and safety
• environmental protection
• artificial intelligence
It may also cover issues of research integrity, including, fabrication, falsification and
plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research or in reporting research
results; this includes misrepresenting credentials and improprieties of authorship.
Ethics Screening
The Ethics Screening is carried out during the scientific evaluation or soon after. The
ethics experts are asked to flag the proposals that have serious or complex issues (on
the basis of the Guidelines on serious and complex ethics issues) that will be the
subject of a more in-depth analysis (Ethics assessment). Proposals involving the use of
human Embryonic Stems Cells (hESCs) or human Embryos (hE) automatically proceed
to the second step, the Ethics Assessment.
Further to the Ethics screening, the proposals that will be funded and are not flagged as
serious or complex must handle the ethics issues in the proposed activities in line with
National and European legislation and practice and the How to complete your ethics
self-assessment guide. The ethics summary report will list the main ethics issues
identified in your proposal. Ethics screening will not issue ethics requirements but can
lead to the obligation to nominate an external independent ethics advisor or board to
assist the project in adhering to the relevant ethical and legal standards.
Ethics Assessment
For the limited number of proposals flagged as serious or complex and for all the
proposals involving the use of hESCs or hE, the Ethics Screening is followed by an
Ethics Assessment prior to the signature of the grant agreement.
The Ethics Assessment is an in-depth analysis of the ethical issues of the proposals,
taking into account the analysis made during the Ethics screening. The Ethics
Assessment can lead to ethics requirements that are inserted as obligations in the grant
agreement.
If the proposal undergoes an Ethics Assessment, you will receive an ethics summary
report with an ethics opinion on your proposal. The possible outcomes of the ethics
assessment are:
1. Ethics clearance
24EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
The ethics issues are appropriately addressed. The ethics section in the proposal
can be transferred mostly unchanged to the ethics section in Part B of the
description of the action (DoA).
2. Conditional ethics clearance
In this case clearance is subject to conditions. Your ethics summary report will
list one or more 'ethics requirements'. These may include:
• regular reporting to the Commission or the agency concerned
• appointing an independent ethics advisor or ethics board (possibly with a
task to report on compliance with ethics requirements)
• supplying further information/documents
• adjusting methodology so as to comply with ethical principles and relevant
legislation
Ethics requirements must be implemented during grant preparation or during the
grant implementation.
• Ethics requirements due before grant signature normally require that
you update the ethics section in the narrative part (Part B) of the DoA
(Annex 1). However, other parts of Annex 1 may also be affected.
Exceptionally, additional supporting documents may be required before the
grant agreement can be signed.
• Ethics requirements due after project start are automatically included in
the grant agreement in the form of 'ethics deliverables'.
Tasks of the coordinator or sole applicant:
• update the DoA whenever appropriate to address the ethics requirements
and describe how they are to be met in the course of the project
• provide supporting documents if exceptionally requested before grant
signature
• take into account any recommendations set out in the ethics summary
report.
3. Request for additional information (intermediate outcome)
You may be asked to provide additional information if this is needed to complete
the ethics assessment (e.g. in case of serious or complex ethics issues or
missing information).
4. No ethics clearance
After the second ethics assessment, if your proposal is not given ethics
clearance, it is not eligible for funding and will be rejected.
You will be informed of
• the decision to reject your proposal
• the reasons for the decision
• how you can appeal against it.
25EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Ethics requirements and ethics work package
Ethics deliverables: All ethics requirements due after project start are automatically
included in the grant agreement in the form of deliverables. These deliverables are
known as 'ethics deliverables' and will be placed in an automatically generated work
package called 'ethics requirements'.
Work package 'ethics requirements' - if applicable - is added to your grant agreement
as soon as the ethics assessment has been completed. At this point in time it will
appear as the last work package in the list of work packages (WP). During grant
preparation you can move this WP to any other position in the list by drag & drop. It is
recommended to keep the 'ethics requirements' WP at the end of the list where it will
not affect the numbering of the other work packages.
Ethics checks, reviews and audits
During the Ethics Screening or the Ethics Assessment, the experts identify the projects
that need an Ethics Check or Review, which are executed during the course of the
research project. The procedure can also be initiated by the Commission services.
The objective of the procedure is to assist the beneficiaries to deal with the ethics
issues raised by their research and if necessary to take preventive or/and corrective
measures. The Ethics check is an internal check by the project officer or ethics officer
who may be supported by ethics experts and the Ethics Review is an elaborate review
and in-depth procedure carried out by up to 5 external ethics experts. They are both
conducted on the basis of the information provided by the concerned beneficiaries, who
may be invited to a meeting in Brussels to discuss the issues at stake. Onsite visits can
also be organised during the Ethics Reviews.
In case of substantial breach of ethical principles, research integrity or relevant
legislation, the Commission can carry out an Ethics Audit following the provisions and
procedures laid down in the grant agreement.
The checks, post-grant reviews and audits can result in an amendment of the grant
agreement. In severe cases, it can lead, upon the decision of the Commission services
to a reduction of the grant, its termination or any other appropriate measures, in
accordance with the provisions of the grant agreement.

Activities carried out under the programme must comply with the applicable security
rules and in particular, rules on the protection of classified information against
unauthorised disclosure, including compliance with any relevant EU and national law.
Where appropriate, the actions carried out under the Horizon Europe Programme must
comply with Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444, and its implementing rules.
The Horizon Europe Model Grant Agreement includes specific security related obligations
(Article 13 and Annex 5). The Horizon Europe Programme Security Instruction (PSI) has
to be followed in case a proposal selected for funding will lead to a project that involves
classified information.
The process to assess and address the security dimension of activities funded under
Horizon Europe is called the Security Appraisal Procedure.
Security Appraisal Procedure
The Security Appraisal Procedure concerns all activities funded under Horizon Europe
and includes three main steps: the Security Self-assessment, performed by the
applicants at the proposal preparation stage, the Security Review Procedure, conducted
before the start of the project, as well as the Security checks, conducted during or after
the life of the project.
Security Self-assessment
When preparing a proposal to be submitted under any of the Horizon Europe calls, the
applicant is required to conduct a Security Self-assessment starting with the completion
of a Security Issues Table. In case the proposal is submitted under a call or topic, which
is a priori flagged by the Commission as security sensitive, the applicant is also required
to complete a Security Section. Further information and guidance can be found in the
How to handle security-sensitive projects guide.
Security Review
Only proposals above threshold and considered for funding will undergo a Security
Review carried out by granting authority and Commission qualified staff, as well as by
national security experts.
The Security Review includes three steps: the Security Pre-screening performed by the
granting authority, the Security Screening performed by the Commission and the
Security Scrutiny conducted by national security experts. The Security Review is
28EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
organised based on whether the call or topic, under which a proposal is submitted, is
security sensitive or not and it can lead to security requirements that become
contractual obligations.
The Security Review Procedure focusses on the compliance with security rules and in
particular, on the protection of sensitive and classified information against unauthorised
disclosure. The objective of the Security Review is to identify and address security
issues that could emerge from the research by adopting appropriate mitigation
measures.
Security Pre-screening
The first phase of the Security Review Procedure, the Security Pre-Screening, is carried
out by qualified staff of the granting authority, during the scientific evaluation or soon
after, in the following cases:
• If the proposal has been submitted under a call or topic not flagged as security
sensitive and the applicant has replied positively to at least one of the questions
in the Security Issues table.
• If the proposal has been submitted under a call or topic not flagged as security
sensitive and the applicant has replied negatively to all the questions in the
Security Issues table, but the granting authority has, nevertheless, detected
security issues.
Security Screening
The Security Screening is performed by qualified staff of the Commission. All the
proposals that have gone through the Security Pre-screening will be automatically sent
to the second phase of the Security Review. During this phase, the Commission (DG
HOME) will assess the results of the pre-screening and decide whether the launch of the
third phase of the procedure, the Security Scrutiny, is needed.
Security Scrutiny
The Security Scrutiny is the last phase of the Security Review and it is conducted by the
Security Scrutiny Group, comprised of national security experts appointed in close
cooperation with the relevant Programme Committee and the competent National
Security Authorities. It is chaired by the Commission. The Security Scrutiny will be
carried out prior to the signature of the grant agreement in the following cases:
• Automatically, if the proposal has been submitted under a call or topic flagged as
security sensitive.
• In other cases, if the Security Screening has concluded that the proposal is very
likely to raise security issues for which mitigation measures should be proposed.
The objective of the Security Scrutiny is to identify security concerns in a certain
proposal, assess if sensitive or classified information will be used or produced by a
certain project, verify whether the security issues have been properly addressed by the
applicant and propose recommendations in order to properly address the identified
security issues. The purpose of the Security Scrutiny is to address potential misuse of
project results (e.g. results that could be channelled into crime or terrorism or results
that could adversely affect critical infrastructure). For additional information, see the
Guidance note on potential misuse of research. The information is classified according
to the Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe projects.
The Security Scrutiny may result in security requirements that, in principle, will have
to be fulfilled by the beneficiaries before the signature of the Grant Agreement. The
security requirements may include limiting the dissemination level of certain
29EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
deliverables for security reasons, classifying certain deliverables or other security
recommendations. Other security recommendations may include appointing a Project
Security Officer, establishing a Security Advisory Board, ensuring that personnel has
followed security trainings, limiting the level of detail, using a fake scenario, excluding
the use of classified information, adjusting the scope of a certain work package etc.
As the result of the Security Scrutiny a security summary report will be produced. It will
contain the security opinion and security recommendations. It will be provided to the
applicants at the stage of the grant preparation in order to implement the security
requirements.
The possible outcomes of the Security Scrutiny are:
1. No security concern
No security issues were identified in the proposal. No need for the Grant
Agreement to include a security section.
2. Security recommendations and/or security classification
The security summary report will list one or more security requirements. These
requirements should be set out in the security section of Part B of the DoA of the
Grant Agreement and may include:
• security recommendation to limit the dissemination level of certain
deliverables for security reasons
• classification of certain deliverables at a certain level (the classification
levels applied in Horizon Europe research projects are RESTREINT UE/EU
RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET UE/EU
SECRET)
• appointment of a Project Security Officer in case of classified deliverables
• establishment of a Security Advisory Board
• other security recommendations.
The security requirements must be implemented during grant preparation and
before grant signature. You will be required to update the security section in
the narrative part (Part B) of the DoA (Annex 1). In certain exceptional cases,
security requirements will be implemented during the grant implementation, e.g.
issue of Personnel Security Clearance.
3. Proposal too sensitive to be funded
The Security Scrutiny may reveal that the information to be used or generated
by the project is too sensitive, or that the applicants lack the right experience,
skills or authorisations to handle classified information at the appropriate level.
In such cases, funding is refused and the proposal is rejected.
If this happens, your report will contain the following information:
• the decision to reject your proposal;
• the reasons for the rejection, except if they are classified;
• the way to appeal against it.
Security Checks
30EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Where appropriate, the Commission or the relevant funding body may carry out security
checks.

Dissemination and exploitation is an obligation and opportunity for a project to
further scale-up the results, shed light on the work done and bring value to it by
creating a positive impact in various fields.
Dissemination and Exploitation activities help to diffuse knowledge, increase the use of
Research & Innovation (R&I) projects results in the EU and beyond and support a more
robust evidence-based policy making.
What is dissemination and exploitation?
They can be defined as:
• Dissemination: the public disclosure of the results by appropriate means (other
than resulting from protecting or exploiting the results), including by scientific
publications in any medium.
• Exploitation: the use of results in further research and innovation activities
other than those covered by the action concerned, including among other things,
commercial exploitation such as developing, creating, manufacturing and
marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in
standardisation activities.
• Results: Results’ means any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as
data, know-how or information, whatever its form or nature, whether or not it
can be protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual
property rights.
31EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
How should you address dissemination and exploitation?
The rules for participation under Horizon Europe10 reinforce focus on exploitation,
in particular within the EU as well as the role of the plan for the dissemination and
exploitation during and after the end of the project.
Unless the work programme states otherwise11, proposals should include a planned
summary of communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that they
will carry out to achieve the expected impact.
• If the expected exploitation of the results entails developing, creating,
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing
a service, the plan should include a strategy for such exploitation.
• If the plan provides for the exploitation of the results primarily in non-associated
third countries, the legal entities must explain how that exploitation is still to be
considered to be in the EU interest.
If the proposal is successful, then the beneficiaries must provide (normally with the first
six months of the action) and regularly update the complete Plan for the
exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities.
Beneficiaries must also report on the activities undertaken.
The applicant already at the stage of forming the consortium should pay attention to
eventual and expected results, ownership issues and the associated intellectual property
rights (IPR) with a view to disseminating and exploiting the results efficiently.
• The consortium agreement sets the framework for successful project
implementation and results exploitation including intellectual property
management, and is meant to settle if already possible all issues that might
hamper the smooth and seamless cooperation of the different actors for the
different parts of the project.
• Having a consortium agreement with clear IPR management and ownership
rights agreed by the consortium members can maximise the exploitation
potential of the project’s results.
• The consortium agreement should in principle be negotiated and concluded
before signing the grant agreement, and should complement the grant
agreement but must not contain any provision contrary to it.
• The consortium agreement is a private agreement between the beneficiaries
setting out the rights and obligations amongst themselves, and does not involve
the Commission/Agency.
During the implementation of the project and after the end of the action the
beneficiaries:
• must use their best efforts to exploit the research results or have them
exploited by another legal entity. If, despite a beneficiary's best efforts to exploit
its results directly or indirectly, the results are not exploited within one year
after the end of the action (as established in the grant agreement), the
10 Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing
Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for
participation and dissemination, and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1290/2013 and (EU) No 1291/2013
(OJ 12.5.2021 L 170/1).
11 Some proposers (e.g. applying in response to a European Research Council call, or the Marie-Sklodowska
Curie Actions-COFUND programme) are exempted from this obligation. Please refer to the work
programme.
32EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
beneficiary must (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the granting authority)
use the Horizon Results Platform to find interested parties to exploit the
results.
• where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations (including
obligations linked to the restriction of participation or control due to strategic
assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons), must comply with them — up
to four years after the end of the action.
• should also disseminate their results as soon as feasible, in a publicly available
format. Beneficiaries that intend to disseminate their results must give advance
notice to the other beneficiaries in the action. Any other beneficiary may object if
it can show that dissemination of the results would significantly harm its
legitimate interests in relation to its results or background. In such cases, the
results must not be disseminated unless appropriate steps are taken to
safeguard those legitimate interests.
The beneficiaries must update the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of
the results including communication activities, during and after the end of the action, in
accordance with the grant agreement.
To enhance dissemination and exploitation impact, the EU offers a wide range of
services free of charge such as Horizon Results Booster, Horizon Results Platorm, to
assist beneficiaries in dissemination and exploitation activities and to enhance visibility
of results.
Guidelines for your dissemination, exploitation and communication activities
We suggest you take a step-by-step approach to dissemination, exploitation and
communication activities while developing your proposal for an application and during
the implementation of the project. The guidelines below clarify key concepts and
provide with practical examples. They are by no mean compulsory.
The dissemination and exploitation part
1. Prepare your planned summary of communication, dissemination and
exploitation activities carefully.
This must be a distinct part of your proposal (unless excluded by the call conditions). As
it is too early to know what kind of results you will obtain, at this stage we only expect
a planned summary of communication, dissemination and exploitation activities. If
proposal is selected, you will be asked to submit a complete plan within 6 months after
the date of signature of your grant agreement and regularly update it.
In order to give you an idea of how these recommendations could be described in your
proposal, please see the following example of a water treatment project:
o Identify the problem/need to address
Example: In a context of pandemic, the current sand water treatment does not
filter against viruses. It requires the use of iodine and chlorine which in large
quantity may have an impact on health and the environment. Chlorine also has a
taste that makes it unpleasant for the consumer who then resorts to bottled
water.
o Check what is the current offer (e.g. the current existing solutions offered by
competitors)
33EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Example: The market usually offers: Reverse Osmosis (R.O.) Membranes,
Ultrafiltration (U.F.) Membranes, Micro-Filtration (M.F.) Membrane, Nano-
Filtration (N.F.) Membrane
o Describe what is the added value of your research, technology,
methodology
Example: Using techniques issued from biomimetics, to filter the water and
combat the viruses like live organisms do in nature
o Identify the Key Exploitable Result(s) (KER)
Example: Our KER will be an eco-friendly biomimetic membrane for filtering
water thereby removing 99% of viruses in water treatment plants.
o Explain what the outcome is (do not confuse it with the expected impact
to be addressed in the canvas of the application)
Example of the outcome: We would like to create a filtering membrane to treat
tap water. At the end of the project, the technology should be used by 10 water
treatment plants.
The expected impact will be: For companies and water treatment plants, our
technology is expected to reduce the costs in the long run (after the initial
investment) and the use of chemical product to treat the water. We plan on
testing the technology in X region(s) of the EU and this environmental friendly
technology should encourage help reducing the use of plastic bottles by
consumers who would then drink tap water.
o Identify the target groups (early adopters)
Example:
Target group: water treatment equipment manufacturers (filter manufacturers)
End users: water treatment plants that have been approached by the consortium
and agreed to test the technology
o Describe dissemination measures and channels to reach out to your
target audience
Example of dissemination measures: Organising visits for potential investors
and/or B2B to the demo plant. Participation in events such as trade fair
dissemination to increase awareness of our project amongst target user base,
including international conferences on water management & environment
o Describe exploitation measures
Examples of exploitation measures:
− Create a Demo plant to show the UVP (Unique Value Proposition) of the novel
solution
− Establish contacts with industry (B2B) e.g. scan main players in the water
treatment and gather information about the dynamics of target markets
− Reach out to end-users (regional water authorities, consumers) identified
during the dissemination activities to redefine/improve features of the
product
34EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
− Organise testbeds with end users (public authorities, companies in water
treatment, citizens)
o Describe how your results can feed back to policy-making and how they
contribute to the EU priorities
Example:Water treatment would contribute to higher quality of tap water at a
lesser cost with a better taste and the guarantee of a safer product (free of
viruses), thereby encouraging citizens to drink tap water instead of bottled
water, and reducing the impact on the environment, thereby contributing to the
green deal. We will reach out to the local authorities to raise their awareness and
get their support.
We will implement a mapping of stakeholders at the local governmental level.
For that we can rely on indicators as level of interest in water management but
also Go-to-market service from Horizon Results Booster.
We will create a white paper to be distributed to regional water authorities from
the region of A and B (where we intend to run the tests)
2. Involve potential end-users and stakeholders in your proposal.
If they are committed from early on, they may help guide your work towards specific
qualities and applications of your results. End-users could come from the regional,
national and international networks of consortium partners, or from the value chains
they operate in. They could be involved as partners in the project, or, throughout its
duration, as members of an advisory board or user group tasked with co-creating and
testing the results and providing feedback. In the case of policy recommendations, you
may want to approach policy-makers from a local/regional/national authorities, or
regulatory bodies in order to design your research project bearing in mind their needs.
3. Say how you expect the results of your project to be exploited/further
developed and give the main advantages of the new solution(s) you expect
to deliver.
The results could be, for example: a manual, test, model, new therapy, better product
or process, or an improved understanding of mechanisms and advantages for reduced
material or energy use, improved safety, or better-trained staff.
Explain how you expect the results like these to be exploited. This could also depend on
progress elsewhere in the innovation chain, in related projects or in adjacent fields - so
outline these dependencies and any progress to be made in these areas.
4. Link your proposal to the policy context of the call for proposals.
Think of how your project results will contribute to the outcomes specified in the calls
and topics and how they are linked to a wider impact in the longer term, specified in the
respective destinations of the work programme. Consider the following questions:
• What are the objectives of your project?
• Why and how they can be important in view of the work programme?
• What target audience (user communities? Parts of the society?) would benefit?
• Is it clear how the effects of your project can contribute to the outcomes or
wider impact?
5. Implement open science practices
35EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Think of use, ownership and access rights.
Open science practices are addressed and evaluated under ‘excellence’ as they are
considered a part of the methodology. However, open access in particular also results in
the broad dissemination of knowledge and is relevant in the context of dissemination.
Providing open access to peer-reviewed publications is mandatory in Horizon Europe,
when peer-reviewed publications are produced. Open access to generated research data
is required under the premise ‘as open as possible as closed as necessary’, meaning
that there can be exceptions to this. Data management plans are mandatory for all
projects generating or reusing data. Additionally, we recommend that you provide open
access to research outputs beyond publications and data and share them as early and
openly as possible.
Please consult the relevant sections under ‘open science’ for guidance on all of the
above and the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement for further guidance regarding the
requirements.
6. Show you understand the barriers to any exploitation of your results.
How will you tackle them?
Possible obstacles may include:
• Inadequate financing
• Skills shortages
• Other R&I work within and beyond Horizon Europe
• Regulation that hinders innovation12
• Ontellectual property right issues
• Traditional value chains that are less keen to innovate
• Incompatibility between parts of systems (lack of standards)
• Mismatch between market needs and the solution
• User behaviour
Your proposal should show you understand these impediments and how you will tackle
them. You may involve in your project experts in economics, business, marketing and
public administration that could help to overcome barriers.
In order to enhance your dissemination and exploitation activities, e.g. to draft the
plan, improve and follow-up on D&E activities, you can apply to Horizon Results Booster
during and after project implementation. The Horizon Results Booster is a free of charge
expert service to help effectively disseminate and exploit research results. As soon as
you have identified key exploitable results in your project, you can publish a profile of
your result(s) in Horizon Results Platform to promote the results, accelerate
matchmaking with potential investors, partners or other stakeholders of interest to you.
7. Think ahead. Once your research and innovation is complete, will you need
to take further steps to apply it in actual practice?
Examples of further steps: Standards to be agreed on, financing the testing and
prototyping, scaling up or production, promoting acceptance by consumers or other
12 See Innovation Principle, a tool to ensure that EU policies and legislation support innovation.
36EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
partners in a value chain. Policymakers may also establish follow-up steps to integrate
the results into policies.
You could also consider additional funding and support schemes for follow-up steps, e.g.
national programmes, EIC, Invest EU, Regional Funds, European Structural and
Investment Funds, Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), European IPR Helpdesk, Horizon
Results Platform, Horizon Results Booster, Dealflow and others.
The communication part
Since EU grants are financed by public funds, beneficiaries are generally expected to
actively engage in communication activities and to promote the projects.
Communication can be defined as: Taking strategic and targeted measures for
promoting the action itself and its results to a multitude of audiences, including the
media and the public, and possibly engaging in a two-way exchange.
Communication activities must already be part of the proposal and be described in the
draft Dissemination and exploitation plan including communication activities which is an
admissibility criterion.
A good communication plan should define clear objectives (adapted to various relevant
target audiences) and set out a description and timing for each activity.
With your communication activities you should draw the attention of general and
specialised audiences to the EU policy area addressed by the call.
Good communication:
• Starts at the outset of the action and continues throughout its entire lifetime.
• Is strategically planned and not just ad-hoc efforts.
• Identifies and sets clear communication objectives (e.g. have final and
intermediate communication aims been specified? What impact is intended?
What reaction or change is expected from the target audience?).
• Is targeted and adapted to audiences that go beyond the project's own
community, including the media and the public.
• Chooses relevant messages (e.g. how does the action's work relate to our
everyday lives? Why does the target audience need to know about the action?).
• Uses the right medium and means (e.g. working at the right level — local,
regional, national, EU-wide; using the right ways to communicate — one-way
exchange (website, press release, brochure, etc) or two-way exchange
(exhibition, school visit, internet debate, et.); where relevant, include measures
for public/societal engagement on issues related to the action).
• Is proportionate to the scale of the action.
Strategy for intellectual property management
Applicants must outline their strategy for the management of intellectual property (IP),
including intended protection measures (if relevant) and how these would be used to
support exploitation in the proposal (section on impact).
Particularly in the case of projects aimed at economic and societal exploitation, the
strategy for IP management must be commensurate with the desired outcomes and
impacts. Hence, a weakness or failure to submit such a strategy would also need to be
37EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
reflected in the proposal evaluation (scoring) with view to the ‘credibility’ of the
envisaged impact pathways.
Results ownership
1. What is the ownership of results?
The owner of results is the natural or legal entity that has generated the results.
Results are defined as any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as data,
know-how or information, whatever its form or nature, whether or not it can be
protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual property rights.
2. When do you have to address the ownership of your results?
The ownership of potential results should be addressed very early by the consortium
members when preparing the proposal.
3. Why does the results ownership matter?
Horizon Europe has the specific objective to strengthen the deployment and exploitation
of innovative solutions. This objective calls for transparency and clarity in terms of
results ownership.
The lack of clarity on the ownership of results can be one of the main obstacles for
exploitation and commercialisation, especially for SMEs. Clarity of results ownership is a
critical factor for attracting investors. Beneficiaries should also clarify their freedom to
operate without infringing on intellectual property owned by third parties that might
require specific action (e.g. licencing) to fully exploit the own intellectual property.
More practically speaking, it is important that potential future consortium members
decide on the ownership of results when drafting the proposal to simplify their lives as
beneficiaries. Indeed, beneficiaries must indicate the owner(s) of the results in the final
periodic report of the Horizon Europe project in the so called Results Ownership List. If
the ownership of results has not been carefully thought through at the proposal phase,
beneficiaries may face difficulties in filling in the Results Ownership List at the reporting
stage. Knowing that failure to fill in the Results Ownership List will block the submission
of the final periodic report and hence the payment, dedicating sufficient time on the
allocation of the ownership of results at the proposal phase will avoid hurdles at the end
of the project.
Standardisation
1. What is standardisation?
A standard is a document that sets the technical requirements of a product, service or
process and its use. Standards are adopted by recognised standardisation bodies (such
as ISO, CEN, CENELEC, ETSI, and many more). In these organisations, representatives
from industry, research, governments and civil society, discuss and agree on what
should be a standard. Once a standard is published, its use is normally voluntary but in
some cases certain specific standards can be made mandatory by law.
In other words, standards form a common language that allows researchers, people,
public institutions and industry to communicate, produce and commercialise products
and services in a harmonised manner. This is especially important in the European
single market.
2. Why is it important to consider standardisation when drafting a proposal?
Standards play an important role in the valorisation of research & innovation results:
38EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
They help researchers bring their innovation to the market and spread technological
advances by making their results transparent. In spreading the diffusion of new
technologies, standards provide both economic opportunities, facilitate realisation of
SDGs and give confidence to consumers that an innovative technology is safe.
They codify the technology requirements and inform both manufacturers and
consumers on what to expect.
They allow technologies and materials to be interoperable: since a standard provides
details on the use and content of a technology or a material, it is much easier to know
when and how it can be used in combination with other technologies.
In other words, by codifying information on the state of the art of a particular
technology, standards enable dissemination of knowledge (both within and outside the
relevant industry community). Moreover, standards bridge the gap between research
and products or services allowing the diffusion of the technology in the market and
increasing the probabilities of its take-up. Standardisation facilitates the deployment of
new technologies, interoperability between new products and services. Innovations can
more easily gain market acceptance and consumer trust if they comply with existing
standards for safety, quality, performance and sustainability.
If the project is relevant for standardisation it is advised for applicants to involve
standard development organisations in the consortium in order to facilitate the
valorisation of project results through standardisation.
What is meant by the Do No Significant Harm principle in the context of
Horizon Europe?
The Commission Communication on the European Green Deal13 introduced green oath
to ‘do no harm’. The ‘Do not Significant Harm’ (DNSH) principle has been further
specified in the EU Regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate
sustainable investments14, commonly defined as the ‘EU Taxonomy Regulation’. Six
environmental objectives are listed in Article 915 of the EU Taxonomy and Article 17
specifies what can constitute a ‘significant harm’ for these objectives:
1. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to climate change
mitigation if it leads to significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
2. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to climate change
adaptation if it leads to an increased adverse impact of the current climate and
the expected future climate, on the activity itself or on people, nature or assets;
3. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the sustainable
use and protection of water and marine resources if it is detrimental to the
good status or the good ecological potential of bodies of water, including surface
water and groundwater, or to the good environmental status of marine waters;
4. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the circular
economy, including waste prevention and recycling, if it leads to significant
13 COM (2019) 640, The European Green Deal.
14 The ‘EU Taxonomy Regulation’ refers to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework
to facilitate sustainable investment, by setting out a classification system (or ‘taxonomy’) for
environmentally sustainable economic activities.
15 Climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; sustainable and protection of water and marine
resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; protection and restoration
of biodiversity and ecosystems.
39EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
inefficiencies in the use of materials or in the direct or indirect use of natural
resources, or if it significantly increases the generation, incineration or disposal
of waste, or if the long-term disposal of waste may cause significant and long-
term environmental harm;
5. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to pollution
prevention and control if it leads to a significant increase in emissions of
pollutants into air, water or land;
6. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the protection and
restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems if it is significantly detrimental to
the good condition and resilience of ecosystems, or detrimental to the
conservation status of habitats and species, including those of EU interest.
References on the DNSH principle are included in the General Introduction of the
applicable Horizon Europe Work Programme (2021-2022 and 2023-2024) because of
their particular relevance for environmental outcomes and impacts.
At programming stage, the Horizon Europe work programme has been co-created to
support research and innovation activities that respect climate and environmental
priorities of the EU and cause no significant harm to them.
At project level, the reference to the DNSH principle in the Horizon Europe work
programme is included in the application form (proposal part B template) to offer
researchers the possibility to present the credential of their projects in relation to the
DNSH principle. Applicants can refer to the DNSH principle when presenting their
research methodology and the expected impacts of the project, to show that their
project will not carry out activities that make a significant harm to any of the six
environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation listed above.
However, evaluators will not score applications in relation to their compliance
with the DNSH principle unless explicitly stated in the work programme.
Open science in Horizon Europe
Open science is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of
knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the process. It has the potential
to increase the quality and efficiency of research and accelerate the advancement of
knowledge and innovation by sharing results, making them more reusable and
improving their reproducibility. It entails the involvement of all relevant knowledge
actors.
Horizon Europe moves beyond open access to open science for which it features
a comprehensive policy implemented from the proposal stage to project reporting. The
Horizon Europe Regulation sets the legal basis for the open science obligations and
incentives that apply to Horizon Europe beneficiaries. The AGA — Annotated Grant
Agreement provides guidance on how to comply with the open science obligations
required in the Model Grant Agreement. The present guide complements the
information provided in the Annotated Grant Agreement, with a particular
focus on the preparation of proposals.
40EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
In Horizon Europe, open science practices are considered in the evaluation of proposals,
under ‘Excellence’ and under the ‘Quality and efficiency of implementation’.16 There are
mandatory open science practices, which are required for all projects through the Model
Grant Agreement and/or through the work programme or call conditions, and
recommended practices (all open science practices that are not mandatory).
Recommended open science practices are incentivised through their the evaluation at
the proposal stage. Proposers should be aware of both mandatory and recommended
practices and integrate them into their proposals.
Open science practices include early and open sharing of research (for example
through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, or crowd-sourcing); research
output17 management; measures to ensure reproducibility of research outputs;
providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software,
models, algorithms, and workflows); participation in open peer-review; and involving all
relevant knowledge actors including citizens, civil society and end users in the co-
creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as citizen science).
These practices are explained and relevant resources provided in a separate section
further below (open science practices and resources).
Mandatory open science practices
• Some open science practices are mandatory for all beneficiaries per the grant
agreement. They concern:
o open access to scientific publications under the conditions required by the
grant agreement;
o responsible management of research data in line with the FAIR principles of
‘Findability’, ‘Accessibility’, ‘Interoperability’ and ‘Reusability’, notably
through the generalised use of data management plans, and open access to
research data under the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as
necessary’, under the conditions required by the grant agreement;
o information about the research outputs/tools/instruments needed to validate
the conclusions of scientific publications or to validate/re-use research data;
o digital or physical access to the results needed to validate the conclusions of
scientific publications, unless exceptions apply;
o in cases of public emergency, if requested by the granting authority,
immediate open access to all research outputs under open licenses or, if
exceptions apply, access under fair and reasonable conditions to legal
entities that need the research outputs to address the public emergency18.
These obligations are described in the Model Grant Agreement (Article 17) and detailed
guidelines on complying with them are provided in the Annotated Grant Agreement
(Article 17).
• Some open science practices are mandatory per specific work programmes or
call conditions, which may provide for additional obligations to adhere to open
science practices.
16 This does not apply to the ERC programme that does not include open science in the evaluation. It also
does not include EIC transition calls where open science practices are exceptionally evaluated under
‘impact’.
17 These are results generated by the action to which online access can be given in the form of scientific
publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such as software, algorithms, protocols
and electronic notebooks.
18 The additional provision on access in cases of public emergency does not apply to the ERC.
41EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Recommended open science practices
These are open science practices beyond the mandatory ones, such as involving all
relevant knowledge actors, including citizens, early and open sharing of research,
output management beyond research data, open peer-review. This is a non-exhaustive
list of practices that proposers are expected to adopt when possible and appropriate for
their projects. Finally, certain work programme topics or call conditions may encourage
specific additional open science practices.
Evaluation of open science practices
Open science practices are evaluated under the ‘Excellence’ criterion (in particular
under methodology) and under the ‘Quality and efficiency of implementation’
award criterion. Proposers should address open science practices in the relevant section
on open science under methodology19.
Proposers will have to provide concrete information on how they plan to comply with
the mandatory open science practices. Failure to sufficiently address this, will result
in a lower evaluation score.
A clear explanation of how they will adopt recommended practices, as appropriate for
their projects, will result in a higher evaluation score.
If proposers believe that none of the open science practices (mandatory or
recommended) apply to their project, then they have to provide a justification.
Under the ‘Excellence’ part of their proposals, in the section on methodology,
proposers should describe how open science practices (mandatory and recommended,
as appropriate) are implemented as an integral part of the methodology and show how
their implementation is adapted to the nature of their work, therefore increasing the
chances of the project delivering on its objectives. Information relevant to the specific
area of the proposal should be provided in no more than one page. If open science
practices are not applicable to the proposal, justifications should be provided sp that, if
evaluators agree, open science will not be taken into consideration in the evaluation.
Additionally, proposers generating or reusing data should outline in a maximum of one
(additional) page their plans for data management.
Under ‘Capacity of participants and consortium as a whole’, proposers should
describe how the consortium brings together the necessary disciplinary and inter-
disciplinary knowledge. Proposers should show how this includes expertise and/or track
record in open science practices, relevant to what is planned for the project. If
justification has been provided that open science practices are not relevant for their
projects, it is not necessary to demonstrate track record and expertise.
Finally, in Part A of their proposals, proposers are asked to list up to five relevant
publications, widely used datasets or other achievements of consortium members that
they consider significant for the action proposed. Open access is expected for
publications, in particular journal articles, while datasets are expected to be FAIR and
‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. If publications are not open access,
proposers are strongly encouraged to deposit them retroactively in repositories and
provide open access to them when possible. The significance of publications will not be
evaluated on the basis of the Journal Impact Factor of the venue they are published in,
but on the basis of a qualitative assessment provided by the proposers for each
publication.
19 The information in this section does not apply to the ERC programme, which does not include open
science in the evaluation.
42EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
How should you address open science practices in your proposal?
Make sure to read the Annotated Grant Agreement on the mandatory open science
practices in combination with this guide20.
Early and open sharing: Provide specific information on whether and how you will
implement early and open sharing and for which part of your expected output. For
example, you may mention what type of early and open sharing is appropriate for your
discipline and project, such as preprints or preregistration/registration reports, and
which platforms you plan to use.
Research data management (RDM): RDM is mandatory in Horizon Europe for
projects generating or reusing data. If you expect to generate or reuse data and/or
other research outputs (except for publications), you are required to outline in a
maximum of one page how these will be managed. Further details on this are provided
in the proposal template in the relevant section on open science. A full data
management plan (DMP) is not required at submission stage. For those work
programmes that require the use of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)
federated repositories, proposers should explicitly discuss the use of such repositories in
their proposals. By exception, in cases of a public emergency and if the work
programme requires so, you should submit a full DMP already with submission of
proposals or at the latest by the signature of the grant agreement. A template for a
DMP is provided under the reporting templates in the Funding & Tenders Portal
Reference Documents page.
Reproducibility of research outputs: you should outline the measures planned in the
project that tend to increase reproducibility. Such measures may already be
interweaved in other parts of the methodology of a proposal (such as transparent
research design, the robustness of statistical analyses, addressing negative results, etc)
or in mandatory/non-mandatory open science practices (e.g. the DMP, early sharing
through preregistration and preprints, open access to software, workflows, tools, etc) to
be implemented. More detailed suggestions on good practices for enhancing
reproducibility and resources in the relevant section below.
Horizon Europe requires information via the repository where publications and data
have been deposited on any research output or any other tools and instruments - data,
software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks and others -
needed for the re-use or validation of the conclusions of scientific publications and the
validation and reuse of research data. Further, beneficiaries must provide digital or
physical access to data or other results needed for the validation of the conclusions of
scientific publications, to the extent that their legitimate interests or constraints are
safeguarded21. More details on these requirements for reproducibility and guidance on
how to meet them are provided in the AGA (article 17).
Open access: Offer specific information on how you will meet the open access
requirements, that is deposition and immediate open access to publications and open
access to data (the latter with some exceptions and within the deadlines set in the
DMP) through a trusted repository, and under open licenses. You may elaborate on the
(subscription-based or open access) publishing venues that you will use. You may also
elaborate on the trusted repository/repositories through which open access to
publications and research data will be provided (article 17). Open access to research
data and other research outputs should be addressed in the section on research data
management of your proposal. Research data should be open as a default, unless there
20 The information in this section does not apply to the ERC programme, which does not include open
science in the evaluation.
21 This does not apply to ERC calls.
43EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
are legitimate reasons for keeping them closed. On open access to data and the
legitimate reasons for restricting access, consult the AGA (article 17).
As a general rule, open access to other research outputs such as software, models,
algorithms, workflows, protocols, simulations, electronic notebooks and others is not
required but strongly recommended. Access to ‘physical’ results like cell lines,
biospecimens, compounds, materials, etc. is also strongly encouraged.
Open peer review: Anytime it is possible, you are invited to prefer open peer review
for your publications over traditional (‘blind’ or ‘closed’) peer review. When the case,
you should provide specific information regarding the publishing venues you envisage to
make use of, and highlight the venues that would qualify as providing open peer review.
Citizen, civil society and end-user engagement: Provide clear and succinct
information on how citizen, civil society and end-user engagement will be implemented
in your project, where/if appropriate. The kinds of engagement activities will depend on
the type of R&I activity envisaged and on the disciplines and sectors implicated.
This may include: co-design activities (such as workshops, focus groups or other means
to develop R&I agendas, roadmaps and policies) often including deep discussion on the
implications, the ethics, the benefits and the challenges related to R&I courses of action
or technology development; co-creation activities (involving citizens and/or end-users
directly in the development of new knowledge or innovation, for instance through
citizen science and user-led innovation); and co-assessment activities (such as assisting
in the monitoring, evaluation and feedback to governance of a project, projects, policies
or programmes on an iterative or even continual basis).
The extent of engagement in the proposal could range from one-off activities alongside
other methodological approaches to being the primary focus or methodological
approach of the project itself. Engagement will require resources and expertise and is
therefore often conducted by dedicated interlocutor organisations or staff with relevant
expertise. More detailed information on these activities and useful resources developed
over the course of Horizon 2020 can be found in the relevant section below.
Open science practices and relevant resources
Early and open sharing of research
‘Early and open sharing’ means making research work, methodologies, outputs, such as
data and software, among others, and findings available as soon as possible in the
research process. Examples of such early sharing include preregistration, registered
reports and pre-prints. Early-sharing practices support reproducibility in the research
and helps researchers secure precedence over their findings and/or conclusions.
Preregistration of the research plan in a public repository makes available the
research hypothesis, study design and planned analysis before data is collected.
Preregistration is assisted by dedicated platforms; it increases the transparency,
credibility and reproducibility of the results and helps addressing publication bias toward
positive findings.
Registered reports are research articles that are peer-reviewed and published in two
stages. The study design and analysis plan including hypothesis and methodology
undergo peer-review of the quality and suitability of the research question and protocol.
If accepted, research protocols are preregistered (see preregistration) and the final
research article is provisionally accepted for publication. After the research is
conducted, an article containing the results and discussion as well as any changes is
submitted and undergoes a second round of peer-reviewing. Registered reports reduce
publishing bias for positive results as the acceptance for publication is based on the
quality of the research, regardless of the outcome.
44EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Preprints are scientific manuscripts that are publicly shared prior to peer-review and
journal publication via preprint platforms. An increasing number of journals accepts
sharing of preprints prior to publication, but there are exceptions. Beneficiaries have to
check the policy of their target journal to clear that a preprint will not pre-empt its
publication.

Research data management and management of other research outputs
Research data management (RDM) is the process within the research lifecycle that
includes the data collection or acquisition, organisation, curation, storage, (long-term)
preservation, security, quality assurance, allocation of persistent identifiers (PIDs),
provision of metadata in line with disciplinary requirements, licencing, and rules and
procedures for sharing of data. RDM is an essential element in any project that
generates, collects or re-uses data. Planning ahead to data needs that proposers are
45EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
likely to encounter during the project is a best practice. For example, provisions need to
be in place to ensure that data is managed responsibly (e.g. the right venue is chosen
for deposition, adequate are issued, legal provisions such as General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) are respected, etc). Further, data management should be in line
with the FAIR principles22, to ensure that researchers can find, access and re-use each
other’s data, maximising the effectiveness and reproducibility of the research
undertaken.
RDM, in line with the FAIR principles is a requirement that should be carried out
regardless of whether the data generated and re-used in the project is intended to be
openly accessible, or if access restrictions are foreseen. FAIR data is not equivalent to
open data (publicly available to everyone to access and reuse). Data can, and should be
FAIR even when access is restricted.
RDM and the FAIR principles can be applied to research outputs other than data (i.e.
workflows, protocols, software, samples, etc). Proposers are recommended to consider
robust management practices for data and other research outputs as early as the
proposal stage of their project.
Below are important elements and resources for RDM useful already at proposal stage.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are key in ensuring the findability of research outputs,
including data. They are globally unique and long-lasting references to digital objects
(such as data, publications and other research outputs) or non-digital objects such as
researchers, research institutions, grants, etc. Frequently used persistent identifiers
include digital object identifiers (DOIs), Handles, and others. For further reading on PID
types, please refer to https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/technical-solutions-and-
tools/persistent-identifiers.
To enhance the findability of research outputs, and their potential reuse, standardised
metadata frameworks are essential, ensuring that data and other research outputs
are accompanied by rich metadata that provides them with context.
To enhance the re-usability of research data, they must be licenced. For more
information on the licences required for data under Horizon Europe, please refer to the
AGA (article 17).
Trusted repositories assume a central role in the Horizon Europe for the deposition of
and access to publications and research data. For a definition of trusted repositories in
Horizon Europe please refer to the AGA (article 17). Proposers, with the help of data
and research support staff (e.g. data stewards, data librarians, etc), should check
whether the repositories that they plan to deposit their data have the features of
trusted repositories, and justify this accordingly in their Data Management Plans.
Data management plans (DMPs) are a cornerstone for responsible management of
research outputs, notably data and are mandatory in Horizon Europe for projects
generating and/or reusing data (on requirements and the frequency of DMPs as
deliverables consult the AGA article 17). A template for a DMP is provided under the
reporting templates available on the Funding & Tenders Portal Reference documents
page. Its use is recommended but not mandatory. DMPs are formal documents that
outline from the start of the project all aspects of the research data lifecycle, which
includes its organisation and curation, and adequate provisions for its access,
preservation, sharing, and eventual deletion, both during and after a project. Writing a
DMP is part of the methodology of the project, since good data management makes the
work more efficient, saves time, contributes to safeguarding information and to
22 FAIR data are data that are curated to satisfy the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability,
and reusability. For further reading: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/
46EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
increasing the value of the data among the beneficiaries themselves and others, during
and after the research. DMPs are thus a key means of support when planning and
conducting a research project, and, ideally, filling in a DMP should be started prior to
the beginning of the project.
DMPs play a key role in helping researchers to adequately manage research outputs
other than data and publications, also in line with the FAIR principles. Such research
outputs may be physical or digital, and include original software created during the
project, workflows, protocols, new materials such as samples, cell-lines, antibodies,
among many others. DMPs should reflect an adequate management strategy for such
outputs as well.
A DMP should be a living document, which is updated and enriched as the project
evolves. Such updates might occur after attaining milestones related e.g. to the
generation of new data or to reflect changes related to the original planning, changes in
data/output access provisions or curation policies, changes in consortium practices (e.g.
new innovation potential, decision to file for a patent), changes in consortium
composition, etc.
A good practice regarding DMPs is to register them as a non-restricted public
deliverables to make them openly accessible, unless legitimate reasons exist to keep
them confidential. An additional good practice is to publish the DMP in specialised
journals or publishing platforms such as RIO etc., or to deposit them in DMP-specific
public repositories such as DMPOnline and others.
As practices with regard to data management, storage, and sharing differ widely across
disciplines, the DMPs should reflect common disciplinary practices. In addition to
domain specificities, DMPs across the board should address an overarching set of data-
related requirements including those aspects related to making the data FAIR. Common
aspects that need to be addressed in all DMPs include23:
• Data set description: a sufficiently detailed description of the data generated
or re-used, including the scientific focus and technical approach to allow
association of their data sets with specific research as well as information on
data types and an estimate of the data set’s size.
• Standards and metadata: the protocols and standards used to structure the
data (i.e. fully reference the metadata) so that other scientists can make an
assessment and reproduce the dataset. If available, a reference to the
community data standards with which their data conform and that make them
interoperable with other data sets of similar type.
• Name and persistent identifier for the data-sets: a unique and persistent
identification (an identifier) of the data sets and a stable resolvable link to where
the data sets can be directly accessed. Submission to a public repository
normally provides this; many institutional repositories provide similar services.
• Curation and preservation methodology: information on the standards that
will be used to ensure the integrity of the data sets and the period during which
they will be maintained, as well as how they will be preserved and kept
accessible in the longer term. A reference to the public data repository in which
the data will be/is deposited with relevant consideration on whether the chosen
repository meets the requirements of a trusted repository.
23 These aspects are broadly in line with the requirements set forth in Science Europe’s Practical Guide to
the International Alignment of Research Data Management:
https://www.scienceeurope.org/media/4brkxxe5/se_rdm_practical_guide_extended_final.pdf
47EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Data sharing methodology: information on how the data sets can be
accessed, including the terms-of-use or the license under which they can be
accessed and re-used, and information on any restrictions that may apply or
relevant security and privacy considerations. It is also important to specify and
justify the timing of data sharing. On open access to research data see below
relevant section on open access.
• Output management, for research outputs other than data and
publications: The section on output management should show efforts to
manage outputs in line with the FAIR principles, including a detailed description
of the output, consider relevant metadata standards and the provision of PIDs
when depositing the output, or its digital representation if it is physical. The plan
should further detail the deposition, curation and preservation methodology
foreseen, identifying the right home for the output, and it should set out an
approach likely to maximise the re-use and adoption of the output by the wider
research community. If the output is physical, the plan should indicate how it
would be made available to potential users.
• Costs and personnel related to RDM: An estimation of costs related to RDM
such as costs for data collection, data documentation, data storage, data access
and security, data preservation, data availability and reuse as well as the
person/team responsible for data management and quality assurance processes.
The European Open Science Cloud
The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) aims to deploy and consolidate an open,
trusted virtual environment to enable circa 2 million European researchers to store,
share, process, analyse, and reuse research digital objects including data, publications
and software across disciplines and borders. A European co-programmed Partnership
approach for EOSC has been proposed for the period 2021-2030 (https://eosc.eu/). It
will bring together institutional, national and European initiatives and engage all
relevant stakeholders to deploy a European Research Data Commons where data are
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR). This European contribution to a
Web of FAIR Data and Related Services for Science will support open science in a
deepened European Research Area and provide the basis for the research and
innovation data space foreseen in the European Strategy for Data.
Certain work programmes may require the use of trusted repositories that are federated
in EOSC for depositing research data. In that case, data must be deposited in
repositories which are registered to the EOSC and support (implicitly or explicitly) the
FAIR principles. An initial offering of EOSC resources and services can be found from the
EOSC Portal. This offering is expected to continue growing in function of the EOSC rules
of participation.

Measures to ensure reproducibility of results
Reproducibility is the possibility for the scientific community to obtain the same results
as the originators of specific findings. Reproducibility of some or all results is important
as it increases the performance of research & innovation (wider use of research
results); it limits waste of resources (less duplication and fewer false baselines); it
increases the quality and the reliability of research (stronger methods, controls and
reporting); and, as a result, it may increase the trust of citizens in science. Therefore,
reproducibility is integral part of ‘Excellence’; we expect the results of Horizon Europe to
be reproducible, and planning should start at proposal stage to make results reusable
and reproducible.
Below is a list of practices which tend to increase reproducibility. Some of them may
already be required by the MGA (for example DMP, FAIR) or by specific calls and
proposers may interweave such practices in various parts of the methodology section as
appropriate:
• Specify with precision and no ambiguities the research design and the
methodologies that you will be applying.
• Specify how you will deal with negative results, if any, so that others can lean
from your project regarding of its outcomes.
• Make prior searches and checks on existing results and data to ensure you are
not duplicating unnecessarily.
• Specify how you are making use of pre-prints, preregistration of protocols and
registered reports (see above, ‘Early sharing of research results’), to ensure that
your method and research questions are accountable, if applicable.
• Detail the steps you will take to make your research process and tools (software,
materials, protocols, flows, ...) transparent and available during and after the
research.
• Mention the steps, if any, that you will take to ensure the validity and the quality
of the project’s process and results (e.g. peer review, knowledge sharing,
independent testing, supervision, quality control mechanisms).
49EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Plan to use the DMP to the full extent possible to detail the assets and materials
underlying your data collection and analysis (see above, ‘DMP’).
• Ensure that your data are FAIR so that others can find them and re-use them to
reproduce your results (see above, ‘FAIR’).
• Specify how you will ensure robust statistical analysis, that can be repeated
(power of sample, robust experimental techniques, open software, ...).
• Specify what ‘common assets’ for research & innovation your project will be
building, if any, including knowledge bases, methodologies, evaluation
frameworks, ontologies, open repositories, etc.
• Make provisions to validate, demonstrate, make interoperable, scale-up and
overall make replicable the results of your R&I activities.
• Consider whether your project will produce digital copies of your results, e.g.
Digital Twins, virtual bodies, digital blueprints, that increase the likelihood of re-
use and reproducibility.

Open access to research outputs
Open access is online access at no cost for the end user of research outputs such as
scientific publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes (e.g. software,
models, algorithms, protocols and electronic notebooks). Open access often carries less
restrictive copyright and licensing barriers than traditionally published works, for both
the users and the authors.
Open access enables increased quality and efficiency of research and accelerates the
advancement of knowledge and innovation by making results reusable and by
improving their reproducibility. It also offers the means for more creativity, more trust
in science and greater impacts by building on collective intelligence, facilitating cross-
disciplinary research and involvement of all relevant knowledge actors, including
citizens.
Horizon Europe requires deposition of scientific peer-reviewed publications and research
data and open access (with exceptions for research data) following specific
requirements. For guidance on this consult the AGA (article 17).
While it is not mandatory to publish (if a project intends to exploit its results, it may
decide not to publish), if scientific peer-reviewed publications are produced then
they must be open access immediately at publication time under open licenses (such as
Creative Commons), providing specific minimum sets of rights of reuse (CC BY for
articles and book chapters in edited books and CC BY, CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-
ND or equivalent for long-text formats. The following checklist shows what users can do

It is important to be aware that Horizon Europe requires that enough intellectual
property rights are maintained by beneficiaries or authors to ensure the required open
access to scientific publications.
Proposers should be aware that beneficiaries are required to retain sufficient intellectual
property rights (IPR) to comply with their open access obligations. Authors may need to
interact with prospective publishers, in particular when they publish in venues that are
not open access. To facilitate compliance with their open access obligations,
beneficiaries/researchers are encouraged to notify publishers of their grant agreement
obligations (including the licensing requirements) already at manuscript submission. For
example, by adding the following statement to their manuscript: “This work was funded
by the Εuropean Union under the Horizon Europe grant [grant number]. As set out in
the Grant Agreement, beneficiaries must ensure that at the latest at the time of
publication, open access is provided via a trusted repository to the published version or
the final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication under the latest available
version of the Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or a
licence with equivalent rights. CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-ND or equivalent
licenses could be applied to long-text formats.” If the publishing agreement is contrary
to the grant agreement obligations, authors should negotiate its terms and,
alternatively, look for a different publishing venue/options.
Data should be deposited in a trusted repository as soon as possible after data
production and at the latest by the end of the project. Data underpinning a scientific
publication should be deposited at the latest at the time of publication and in line with
standard community practices. Beneficiaries of Horizon Europe have to ensure open
access to research data generated in their projects under the principle ‘as open as
possible and as closed as necessary’. This means that data is in principle open, unless
beneficiaries decide to restrict access to some or all their research data for legitimate
51EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
reasons. On open access to data and the legitimate reasons for restricting access
consult the AGA (article 17) and section above on research data management.
Open access to other research outputs, such as software, workflows and others, will
ensure that these outputs that have been generated by Horizon Europe actions are also
freely accessible to all. This will promote transparency, efficiency and reproducibility, as
well as trust in science, and will facilitate access for citizens. Proposers/beneficiaries are
also encouraged to license research outputs other than publications and data under
appropriate licenses. With regard to software, it should be noted that with the exception
of CC0 (i.e. public domain dedication) CC licenses are not appropriate (although they
can be used for software documentation). Instead, the use of appropriate software
licenses, such as those listed as free by the Free Software Foundation and listed as
open source by the Open Source Initiative, is strongly recommended.

Publishing using open peer-review
Open peer review is an umbrella term for various alternative review methods that seek
to make classical peer review more transparent and accountable. It has neither a
standardised definition, nor an agreed schema of its features and implementations.
Open peer review refers to a peer review process that contains one or more of these
elements24:
• Authors and reviewers are aware of each other’s identity during or after the
review process.
• Review reports are published alongside the relevant article.
• The wider community is able to contribute to the review process (peer
researcher or even general public).
• Manuscripts are made immediately available in advance of the formal peer
review procedure.
• Review or commenting on the final ‘version of record’ is made possible.
• Direct, reciprocal discussion between authors and reviewers and/or between
reviewers is allowed and encouraged.
• Review can be decoupled from publishing when facilitated by a different
organisational entity than the venue of publication (e.g. publishing platforms).
Some journals and scholarly publishers apply open peer review. Some platforms,
including preprint servers, may also facilitate open peer review of preprints. For
example, Open Research Europe, the open access publishing platform of the European
Commission uses the open peer review model, where both names of authors and
reviewers are public, and the review report is open access.
Open peer review is an important aspect of open science. Opening up what has
traditionally been a closed process increases opportunities to spot errors, validate
findings and to increase the overall trust in published outputs. Open peer-review is
considered by some among the measures that increase the quality of the peer review
process (by making it more constructive), and the transparency of research (with
'openness' applying to all processes in the scientific workflow). Another argument to
engage in open peer review is that it ensures reviewers to get credit for their efforts.

(https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/learning/open-peer-review)
Open Research Europe (https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu) supports open
peer review in all scientific fields for all Horizon Europe publications.
Some discipline-specific venues support open peer review and are suitable for the life
sciences (e.g. eLIFE, Bio Med Central, BMJ, GIGA science and BioRxiv, ASAPbio), the
social sciences (e.g. SAGE open, Wiley and SocArXiv) and the arts and humanities
(SAGE open, Wiley and digitalculturebooks).
Citizen, civil society and end-user engagement
Citizen and civil society engagement is a programme principle and operational objective
that refers to the opening up of R&I processes to society to develop better, more
innovative and more relevant outcomes, and to increase societal trust in the processes
and outcomes of R&I.
Opening up the R&I system towards society and supporting citizens, civil society and
end-users to participate in R&I – as sources of ideas, knowledge and/or data, as data
collectors and/or analysers, and/or as testers and/or end users – enlarges the collective
intelligence, capabilities and scope of the R&I and is likely to lead to greater creativity
and robustness of the outcomes and reduced time-to-market of the innovative products
and services. It also increases the relevance and responsiveness of R&I, ensuring that
its outcomes align with the needs, expectations and values of society. Moreover, it is a
key element for improving the transparency, co-ownership and trust of society in the
process and outcomes of R&I. Conducting R&I openly, responsibly, transparently, and in
adherence to the highest standards of research integrity and ethics is also important for
responding to increased science denial.
Engagement can range from the identification and conceptualisation of R&I priorities
(e.g. through deliberative or other participatory processes), to the implementation,
utilisation and assessment of R&I results (e.g. through data collection, data analysis,
discussion and publication or presenting scientific results, working in fab-labs to develop
new innovations, testing innovations and solutions, and evidence-based advocacy).
The following are activities that proposers may consider including in their proposal:
Co-design activities could involve workshops, focus groups or other means to develop
R&I agendas, roadmaps or policies. These could be one-off activities in one or several
different localities or repeated consultations with the same or varying groups. They
could involve citizens and/or one or many organisation types at the same time. Co-
design activities often include deep discussion on the implications, the ethics, the
benefits and the challenges related to R&I courses of action or technology development.
Co-design could be the overall focus of a project (e.g. to develop a roadmap for a
certain technology), a Work Package within a project that uses the outcomes of the co-
design in subsequent Work Packages, or a supporting Work Package that provides
continual feedback on project activities throughout the project cycle.
Co-creation activities, such as citizen science or user-led innovation, involve citizens or
end-users directly in the development of new knowledge or innovations, through a
range of different levels of participation. These could include identifying R&I questions
to be tackled by the project, developing a methodology, observing, gathering and
processing data, right up to the publication and presentation of results. The co-creation
activities could be the focus of a proposal, or could be one of the methodological
approaches taken alongside others.
54EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Co-assessment activities, such as assisting in the monitoring and evaluation of the
progress of the project, portfolio of projects, policies or programmes, help ensure an
iterative or even continual process of interaction with citizens, civil society and end-
users throughout the project cycle on the quality, utilisation and (potential) impact of
project outputs.
In certain cases, citizens, civil society and end-users may be involved across different
stages of the R&I and/or policy cycle, by deciding on the research to be conducted,
conducting that research, analysing and interpreting the data, and engaging in related
advocacy or policy activities.
An important aspect to consider in many cases is the inclusivity of the engagement and
ensuring diversity of participation. The challenge of sustaining engagement should not
be underestimated and different forms of compensation or rewards could be considered,
as well as measures for two-way learning between scientists or innovators and the co-
creators.
Engagement requires resources and expertise. Often, engagement is conducted by
dedicated interlocutor organisations that already have the reach, trust, and expertise to
successfully carry out the engagement exercises. The integration of the engagement
activities, and their outcomes within the project design, should aim to ensure use of the
outcomes (i.e. they are not ‘window dressing’ or unimportant side-activities), and that
there is appropriate feedback and acknowledgement to the engaged. If the call
conditions allow it, the launch of calls for small grants or prizes can be useful (or in
some other cases even essential) for reaching and engaging local communities and
small associations, civil society organisations, social enterprises, or small businesses.
Generally, the greater the interaction from across the quadruple helix (academia-
industry-government-civil), the more the R&I results will be reliable, trusted and taken
up by society. Different organisation types, and different societal perspectives, help
ensure that the processes and the outcomes of the R&I align with the needs, values and
expectations of society. In many cases, the body of knowledge and practice built up in
Horizon 2020 on Responsible Research and Innovation will be relevant.
Co-design, co-creation, and co-assessment, as (sometimes) radical departures from
more traditional forms of R&I, could imply changes to the institutional governance of
the participating beneficiaries that last beyond the lifetime of project funding.
Terminology:
• ‘Citizens’ should be understood as individuals acting on their own initiative and
not on behalf of their employer or sectoral interests. It does not refer to any
legal citizenship(s) that people may or may not hold.
• ‘Civil society’ refers to the ensemble of citizens and civil society organisations
that are active in the public sphere but distinct from government and business.
• ‘Civil society organisations (CSOs)’ include all non-state, not-for-profit
structures, such as citizens’ associations, patient groups, professional societies
or groups, consumer groups, humanitarian organisations, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs), foundations and charities.
• ‘End-users’ are public, private or civil (i.e. civil society, see above) organisations
that constitute potential users of the R&I outputs.
• ‘Engagement’ means the involvement of citizens and civil society in co-designing
R&I agendas, in co-creating R&I contents, and/or in co-assessing R&I outcomes.

What is innovation procurement and how is it relevant for Horizon Europe?
Innovation procurement happens when public procurement is used to drive innovation
from the demand side. This enables the public sector to speed up the development and
adoption of innovative solutions that can improve the quality and efficiency of public
services or address wider societal challenges while opening concrete business
opportunities for companies in Europe to bring innovations to the market.
Innovation procurement is therefore a topic of cross-cutting importance for all
pillars of the Horizon Europe programme:
• Under the Excellence Science pillar, innovation procurement can help increase
the EU’s global scientific competitiveness in the field of research infrastructures.
In the field of supercomputing for example, innovation procurement actions
financed under FP7 and Horizon 2020 have paved the way for stronger European
cooperation and competitiveness through the joint undertaking for High
Performance Computing (HPC).
• Under the Global Challenges and European Industrial Competiveness pillar
innovation procurement can trigger new research and development (R&D) and
deployment of innovative solutions to address societal challenges (e.g. in health,
security, energy, environment, transport…) and reinforce technological and
industrial capacities. For EU-missions, innovation procurement can also play a
key role to bring to the market solutions that can tackle big problems. This
online brochure bundles examples of innovation procurement funded by the EU
research and innovation programme that successfully tackled societal challenges
in several sectors.
• Under the Innovative Europe pillar, innovation procurement links to SME support
via the European Innovation Council.
Finally, innovation procurement is also central to the European Defence Fund and may
also be used in the context of the Euratom Programme.
What is the strategic importance for Europe?
Benchmarking shows that in Europe investments on innovation procurement are 2
times lower compared to other leading global economies. Underinvestment is the
biggest in R&D procurement (5 times lower) and in adoption of ICT based solutions (3
times lower). As innovation procurement is crucial for public sector modernisation and
56EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
business growth, mainstreaming innovation procurement is of strategic
importance to strenghten Europe’s global competitiveness. By closing the gap
between supply and demand in a way that reinforces EU strategic autonomy, innovation
procurement can make a key contribution to economic recovery25. It can increase
resilience in the supply chain by opening up opportunities for innovative companies,
including also SMEs and Startups, to access the public procurement market, attract
financial investment and scale up their business.
How does Horizon Europe support innovation procurement?
Horizon Europe provides EU funding to start innovation procurement. A key difference
to other research and innovation actions is that funding for innovation procurement is
not targeted at potential ‘providers’ but at potential ‘buyers’ of innovative solutions:
public procurers, possibly in cooperation with private and NGO buyers.
Two complementary types of innovation procurement are supported:
• Public Procurement of Innovative solutions (PPI) can be used by procurers
when challenges of public interest can be addressed by innovative solutions that
are nearly or already in small quantities on the market. PPI can thus be used
when there is no need for procurement of new R&D to bring solutions to the
market, but as a clear signal from a sizeable amount of early adopters/launch
customers that they are willing to purchase/deploy the innovative solutions if
those can be delivered with the desired quality and price by a specific moment in
time. PPI may still involve conformance testing before deployment.
• Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) can be used by procurers when there
are no near-to-the-market solutions that meet all the procurers' requirements
and new R&D is needed to get new solutions developed and tested to address
the procurement need. PCP can then compare the pros and cons of alternative
approaches to address the challenge and eliminate risk from promising
innovations step-by-step via solution design, prototyping, development and first
product testing. PCP is a public procurement of R&D services that does not
include the deployment of commercial volumes of end-products (see PPI for the
latter).
In several areas, there is a need for European cross-border cooperation on innovation
procurement to address challenges that require cross-border interoperability or
interconnection, to pool resources for problems that cannot be financed from only
national funding, to obtain higher quality and lower cost solutions and to reduce
fragmentation of demand so that companies can sell their solutions to a wide European
market.
Therefore, Horizon Europe provides different types of support for buyers from
different countries that want to collaborate together on innovation procurement:
• Coordination and Support actions (CSA) support coordination and
networking activities for groups of procurers to investigate the feasibility and/or
prepare the ground for concrete future innovation procurement. CSA grants do
not provide EU co-financing for a procurement action.
• PCP or PPI actions co-finance both the procurement cost for groups of
procurers to buy the research, development, validation and possible first
25 Impacts of EU funded PCP show 20%-30% efficiency and quality improvements in public services,
doubling of the amount of public procurement directly awarded to startups/SMEs, a factor 20 increase in
the amount of cross-border contract award to startups/SMEs and a factor 4 additional financing secured
by startups/SMEs. The use of place of performance and IPR/commercialisation conditions that fuel
commercialisation in Europe, also contributes to EU strategic autonomy.
57EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
deployment (PCP) or wider scale deployment (PPI) of innovative solutions as well
as additional related costs to prepare, manage and follow up such procurement.
A minimum of two public procurers from two different EU Member States or
associated countries are required in the buyers’ group. One of them will act as
lead procurer to coordinate and lead one joint PCP or PPI action or several
separate but coordinated PPI actions for the buyers’ group. In addition other
procurers, e.g. private procurers or NGO procurers, can be part of the buyers’
group. Both in PCP actions, PPI actions and CSAs that prepare PCP or PPI
procurements, other entities (e.g. experts, certification bodies) can also
participate in the additional activities of the action, except entities that are
potential suppliers of solutions for the procurement action or have another
potential conflict of interest with the procurement action. In total there must be
minimum three participants from three different Member States or countries
associated to Horizon Europe in the action. Entities formed by several public
procurers from different countries can also apply for this type of funding (e.g.
European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation- EGTCs, European Research
Infrastructure Consortia – ERICs, Central Purchasing Bodies, etc).
For more information about the CSA and PCP and PPI action instruments, refer to
General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme.
The EU itself can also implement innovation procurement from the Horizon Europe
budget, either alone or together with public buyers from Member States. An example
funded by Horizon Europe is the EU blockchain PCP implemented by the European
Commission.
It is also possible for one single buyer to implement PCP and PPI actions on its own,
under the subcontracting activities of a regular research and innovation grant.
Examples of projects and achievable impacts?
Examples of ongoing PCP and PPI projects funded by previous FP7 and CIP programs
can be found here. Showcase success stories are bundled here. More information about
the impacts achieved by past projects is also available here.
How to find and apply for relevant calls?
If you are a public buyer and you are looking for an overview of all actions that support
innovation procurement, you can search all calls on the Funding and Tenders portal via
the keywords ‘innovation/innovative procurement’, ‘PCP’, ‘PPI’.
Where to find support to prepare a proposal?
Looking for partners? Participate in info days and EU events on innovation
procurement in preparation of calls for proposals. Get connected with other procurers
and experts from around Europe that are interested and active on innovation
procurement via the LinkedIn Group on Innovation Procurement.
National Contact Points (NCPs) in every Member State offer information and guidance in
your own language on how to apply for Horizon Europe funding and may help with
partner search.
Check if there is an innovation procurement competence/support center in your country
where you could find information and support. This European network of national
innovation procurement competence centers can be a starting point.
Is my organisation a public procurer?
58EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Public procurers are organisations that are contracting authorities or contracting
entities according to the definition of those terms in the EU Public Procurement
Directives 2014/24/EU, 2004/25/EU, 2009/81/EC.
‘Contracting authority’ means the State, regional or local authorities, bodies
governed by public law, associations formed by one or several of such authorities or
one or several of such bodies governed by public law (for the full definition, see Article
2(1)(1) of Directive 2014/24/EU). Bodies governed by public law also include entities
financed mostly by the State, regional or local authorities, or other bodies governed by
public law and entities controlled by those bodies (for the full definition, see Article
2(1)(4) of Directive 2014/24/EU). This includes for example ministries, regions, cities,
road management authorities, public hospitals, central purchasing bodies etc.
‘Contracting entities’ refers to entities operating in specific sectors (such as utilities
for water, energy, transport, postal services covered by Directive 2014/25/EU and
contracting entities in the field of security covered by Directive 2009/81/EC). They may
be contracting authorities, public undertakings or entities operating on the basis of
special or exclusive rights (for the full definition, see Article 4 of Directive 2014/25/EU).
Under Horizon Europe, public procurers also include entities that are contracting
authorities/entities according to the above definition but to which the EU Public
Procurement Directives itself do not apply (e.g. international organisations such as
ERICs - European Research Infrastructure Consortia).

in a safe, secure and responsible manner, with a clear identification of and preventative
approach to risks.
To a degree matching the type of research being proposed (from basic to
precompetitive) and as appropriate, AI-based systems or techniques should be, or be
developed to become (implicitly or explicitly contributing to one or several of the
following objectives):
• technically robust, accurate and reproducible, and able to deal with and inform
about possible failures, inaccuracies and errors, proportionate to the assessed
risk posed by the AI-based system or technique
• socially robust, in that they duly consider the context and environment in which
they operate
• reliable and to function as intended, minimising unintentional and unexpected
harm, preventing unacceptable harm and safeguarding the physical and mental
integrity of humans

1. Introduction
In order to receive EU funding/tenders (i.e. grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc), applicants need to fulfill a certain number of conditions
which must be checked before any funding can be awarded to them.
Some of these checks are done centrally by the EU Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register, set up in accordance with
Articles 128 and 147 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/10461 as central repository
and electronic data interchange area for participants.
This guidance sets out the rules that the Central Validation Service will use for these
checks. They currently cover:
− legal entity validation (also called ‘PIC validation’)
− LEAR appointment
− collecting the financial information for the financial capacity assessment (also
called ‘FCA’)
− ownership control assessment (also called ‘OCA’).
For these checks, the participants will be contacted directly by the Central Validation
Service and asked to submit the necessary information and supporting documents via
the Participant Register. This happens normally during preparation of the first grant,
procurement, prize or contribution agreement that successfully passed the evaluation
stage, but can also occur later during subsequent applications or in case of changes.
All data and documents will be treated as confidential.
Personal data will be handled in accordance with Regulation 2018/17252 to ensure
compliance with the principles of transparency, proportionality, impartiality and
legality. For the details, please refer to the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy
Statement (available on Portal > Legal Notices).
2. Legal entity validation
2.1. Legal entity validation and specific legal statuses: Criteria and
conditions
One of the main tasks of the Central Validation Service is the validation of new legal
entities applying for EU grants, procurements, prizes and contribution agreements.
Legal entity validation is a requirement under the Financial Regulation. It serves to
ensure that only verified entities can enter into financial relations with the EU and to
avoid legally invalid contracts.
Legal entity validation is needed only once, to get the legal entity information and
1 Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on
the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No
1296/2013, (EU) No 1301/2013, (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1304/2013, (EU) No 1309/2013, (EU) No
1316/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No 283/2014, and Decision No 541/2014/EU and repealing
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1).
2 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions,
bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No
45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
participant identification code (PIC) validated. Once validated, the participants can
enter into financial relations with the EU and use the PIC for all EU actions managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. The PIC will be valid for all ongoing application
procedures and signature in the system, but also for any type of EU funding in the
future — without having to re-register or be re-validated.
This is why the standards for PIC validation are applied consistently, independently of
the specific call/application/tender procedure that triggers the validation. The same
criteria and checks are applied for grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc, as well as for low and high value contracts.
The validation comprises two distinct actions: (a) the verification that the participant
exists as legal entity capable of entering into financial relations with the EU, including
correctness of the participant’s legal data (legal form, address, etc) and (b) the
verification of certain specific legal statuses that are used in EU funding programmes
and recorded centrally in the Participant Register.
2.1.1 Legal entity validation
‘Legal entity’ means a natural person or an entity created and recognised by law as a
legal person. It must have legal personality and, acting on its own account and in its
own name, be able to exercise rights and be subject to obligations.
Specific cases
❖ Natural persons (including self-employed persons; see below) — Are by default
considered as being legal entities. However, the Central Validation Service will refuse
validation of persons that cannot legally enter into contractual relations with the EU
(e.g. persons under age).
❖ Branches — Are not regarded as legal entities, since they do not have legal
personality distinct from that of their mother-company. The fact that they are
registered in national official registers is not relevant. It will be their mother-company
that will be considered as legal entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in
the Participant Register. The same applies to branches established in a different
country or branches of entities such as non-profit organisations, NGOs, etc.
❖ Foreign companies (company establishments which are registered with a special
status in the official register, e.g. ‘société de droit étranger’) — Will not be regarded
as legal entities, since they do not have legal personality distinct from that of their
mother-company. It will be their mother-company that will be considered as legal
entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register (the
one registered in the country of incorporation).
❖ Entities set-up within (or under) a parent organisation (such as
departments/centers/offices, without legal personality, despite having administrative
or budgetary autonomy, own VAT number/fiscal code/number of registration, etc) —
Cannot be regarded as legal entities and are considered as belonging to their parent-
organisation. It will be their parent organisation that will be considered as legal entity
for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register.
2.1.2 Exception: Validation of private entities without legal personality
By way of exception, the Financial Regulation allows for certain ‘entities without legal
personality’ to be eligible for EU grants. Such entities can therefore be validated in
the Participant Register, provided they meet the conditions set out in Article
197(2)(c) of this Regulation:
7EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on behalf
of the entity
and
− the entity offers equivalent guarantees for the protection of the EU financial
interests as a legal person, in particular equivalent financial and operational
capacity (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
This exception aims at private entities, i.e. associations or similar entities with
permanent structures (secretariat, management board, assembly, etc.) that have
their own activities, but just lack formal legal personality.
Concerning the first condition, the entity must prove its representatives' capacity to
undertake legal obligations on its behalf. This condition is not met when the
obligations are assumed on behalf of the representatives themselves or on behalf of
the owner(s) of the entity.
Concerning the second condition, the entity must prove the following elements:
− existence of patrimony/assets/capital separated and different from those of its
members/owners
and
− rules ensuring that creditors can rely on such patrimony/assets/capital and
that, in case of liquidation/insolvency, creditors are reimbursed prior to the
repartition of the patrimony/assets/capital among the owners/members (—
both conditions must be fulfilled and proved by supporting documents).
This exception only applies for participation in EU grants; entities without legal
personality cannot participate in EU tenders.
2.1.3 Exception: Validation of ministries, specialised entities of IOs and
certain EU bodies
By way of exception, the Central Validation Service will also accept the following
public entities without legal personality to be validated in the Participant Register:
− the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) (explicitly declared eligible by Articles
176(2) and 197(4) of the Financial Regulation)
− ministries, executive services which are part of the public administration of a
(central or federated) State and directly linked to the government and other
services which are part of the legislative or judicial administration, in
accordance with the official organisation of the State
− assimilated international organisations referred to in Article 156(2) of the
Financial Regulation
− specialised entities set up by international organisations, that lack legal
personality
− Common Foreign Security Policy (CFSP) missions and EU special
representatives set up by the Council of the European Union.
Departments/directorates/units/offices and other entities set up within a Ministry (or
within an executive or other service) without legal personality are considered as part
of the same Ministry (or service) and cannot be considered as independent legal
8EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
entities (e.g. schools, libraries, etc). They will have to use the PIC of their parent
organisation to participate in EU grants, procurements, prizes, etc.
2.1.4 Specific legal statuses
In addition, the validation covers the following specific legal statuses that are used in
certain EU funding programmes:
− private entity or public body
− non-profit or for profit organisation
− small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
− middle-capitalisation enterprise (mid-cap)
− non-governmental organisation (NGO)
− civil society organisation (CSO)
− international organisation (IO)
− research organisation
− secondary or higher education establishment.
An entity may be categorised in more than one of these legal statuses (i.e. non-profit,
public body, research organisation, international organisation, etc.).
The practical relevance of these statuses (and what happens if they change) is
established at the level of the different funding programmes, and sometimes even at
the level of the call for proposals/call for tender.
Moreover, not all of these statuses are systematically checked and validated by the
Central Validation Service. Some of them are self-declarations or self-assessments.
This means that the participants are solely responsible for the correctness of the
information they provide (in the self-declaration/self-assessment).
The Central Validation Service may however — at any time — carry out checks on
self-declared/self-assessed statuses against supporting documents and ask for
clarifications.
In case of false declarations, the EU services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status(es)
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements,
etc.; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
Private entity or public body
'Private entity' means an entity established under private law.
‘Public body’ means an entity established as a public body by national law, or an
9EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
international organisation.
‘Established as a public body by national law’ means:
− incorporated as a public body in the act of creation or recognised as a public
body by national law
and
− governed by public law (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
Criteria such as:
− mission or activity in the general interest (public service mission)
− the fact that the shares are owned by a public body (even if ownership reaches
up to 100% of the share capital)
− public financing
− state supervision and control
do NOT constitute sufficient evidence to qualify an entity as a public body, if the
above two conditions are not met.
Public bodies may however act and be subject to private law for some or most of their
activities, provided that, concerning their existence and their functioning, they are
subject to public law.
The two statuses (private entity and public body) are mutually exclusive, meaning
that you can only be validated as one or the other.
They are systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the
Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Self-employed persons (persons who perform an activity independently and with
their own means, such as craftsmen and individuals exercising liberal, industrial and
commercial professions) — Are regarded as ‘natural persons’, not as ‘private entities’;
the business/profession/activity they perform is not provided with independent legal
personality different from that of the person.
❖ Private law bodies with a public service mission3 — A legal entity
incorporated under private law/private legal form is not considered to be a public
body even if owned by the State/other public bodies and/or pursuing a public service
mission.
Non-profit
‘Non-profit entity’ means an entity that is non-profit making by its legal form or legal
purpose (e.g. charitable organisations), or that has a legal or statutory obligation not
to distribute profits to its shareholders or members.
All profits have to be reinvested in the same activity of the entity.
3 Article 62(1)(c)(vi) of Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
10EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Decisions on (not) distributing profits made by the managing board, associates,
stakeholders, members, or representatives and/or practices adopted by the entity to
not distribute profits and/or the absence of profits achieved are not sufficient proof of
the non-profit nature. The obligation not to distribute profits and/or the impossibility
to distribute profits must be based on law and/or the act of establishment/articles of
association/statutes, etc.
Whether the owners/founders of the entity are non-profit and whether the profits are
allocated to non-profit (or for profit) entities is irrelevant.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Public bodies — Are in principle regarded as non-profit by default.
❖ Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) — The classification as ‘non-
governmental organisation (NGO)’ is not relevant for the non-profit status, since in
most countries NGO is not a recognized legal form. By contrast, non-profit status is a
prerequisite for the self-declaration as NGO (see below).
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
‘Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)’ means a micro, small or medium-sized
enterprise as defined in the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361, i.e.:
− engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form (including, in
particular, self-employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or
other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an
economic activity)
and
− employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as
defined in Article 5 of the SME Recommendation) and which have an annual
turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and/or an annual balance sheet total
not exceeding EUR 43 million.4
An entity is considered to be engaged in an ‘economic activity’, if it proves to be
involved in any form of trade or activity done for remuneration or pecuniary interest
on the market. Thus, in general, any activity consisting in (directly or indirectly)
offering goods or services on a given market is an economic activity.
The following will NOT be considered economic activities:
− activities which do not entail (directly or indirectly) some sort of pecuniary
offset or
− activities for which there is no given/direct (or indirect) market or
− activities for which the income generated is not distinct from the personal
income of the entity’s members or shareholders.
4 The SME ceilings must be calculated by including the headcount of staff, the balance sheet total and the
turnover data of all relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361.
11EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
This status is self-declared. For calls where the SME status has an impact on eligibility
or funding (higher funding rate, etc), participants must go through a self-assessment
wizard.
Two-year rule — In accordance with Article 4.2 of the SME Recommendation, the SME
status depends on the ceilings for two consecutive accounting periods. Headcount and
turnover must stay below the ceilings for two accounting periods to obtain the SME
status; conversely, the status will be lost if they rise above the ceilings for two
consecutive periods.
Since the SME self-assessment looks at the information for only one accounting
period (the last one), the SME self-assessment result may be flawed. Participants that
were below the ceiling the year before, must contact the Central Validation Service
via the Participant Register in order to request a formal validation. This validation will
then take into account the two accounting periods.
The two-year rule does not apply for changes due to a merger or acquisition.
Enterprises that are subject to a change in ownership need to be assessed on the
basis of their shareholder structure at the time of the transaction. If the aggregated
headcount and financial data of the new structure exceed the SME ceilings, the SME
status is lost immediately from the date of the transaction5.
Participants whose SME status changes after registration must update their data in
the Participant Register. This is important not only for eligibility checks in grant
applications, but also for statistical purposes.
Specific cases
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that do not yet have
closed accounts or companies without economic activity but expecting to enter
soon into the market — May also qualify as SMEs, as long as they are able to provide
a ‘bona fide estimate’ (in the form of a business plan) covering the period necessary
for the entity to generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long time-to market
— Are allowed to demonstrate that they are engaged in an economic activity by
showing the investments made and the likely expected return.
Middle-capitalisation enterprise (Mid-cap)
'Middle-capitalisation enterprise’ means an enterprise that is:
− not a micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under the EU SME
Recommendation 2003/361
and
− employing up to 3 000 persons6 , where the headcount of staff, including all
relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises, is calculated in
accordance with Article 3 to 6 of the Annex to the Recommendation.
This status is self-declared. For calls where the mid-cap status has an impact on
eligibility or funding (higher funding rate, etc.), participants must go through the SME
5 See Recital 9 of Recommendation No, 2003/361/EC and the User Guide to the SME Definition (p. 14).
6 Expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Annex of EU recommendation
2003/361.
12EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
self-assessment wizard to make sure that they do not fall under the definition of SME,
and then to self-declare that the number of employees does not exceed 3 000
persons.
Non-governmental organisation (NGO)
‘Non-governmental organisations’ are organisations which are voluntary, independent
from government and non-profit, and which are not a political party or trade union.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by private entities,
which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Civil society organisation (CSO)
‘Civil society organisations’ are organisations from the ‘third sector’ of society, distinct
from government and business (i.e. private for profit entities).
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will normally be accepted only by private
entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
International organisation (IO)
‘International organisation’ means an intergovernmental organisation (other than the
EU) established under international public law, including specialised entities — with or
without legal personality — set up by international organisations.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
For some EU funding programmes there are moreover specific subtypes of
international organisations:
− ‘international organisations of European interest for H2020 (H2020 IOEI)’, i.e.
international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member
States or H2020 associated countries and whose main objective is promoting
scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international European research organisations for Horizon Europe (HE IERO)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries and whose main
objective is promoting scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international organisations of European interest for Digital Europe (DEP IOEI)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or whose headquarters are in an EU Member State.
The H2020 IOEI subtype status is systematically checked against supporting
documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.
The HE IERO and DEP IOEI subtype statuses are self-declared. In the future, for calls
where the HE IERO and DEP IOEI statuses have an impact on eligibility or funding,
participants will also be asked to go through a self-assessment wizard.
Specific cases
❖ Entities set up as distinct bodies by an international organisation with a
special mission but which do not have explicit legal personality — Can be validated
as with legal personality, if they meet any of the following criteria:
− they have treaty-making capacity or
13EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− they have capacity to act at international level independently from the
organisation that set them up (i.e. capacity to undertake legal obligations).
If such entities do not meet one of the above criteria, they can exceptionally be
validated as without legal personality (see section 2.1.3 above).
Research organisation
‘Research organisation’ means an entity that:
− is established as non-profit organisation as described above
and
− carries out research and/or technological development as its main objective.
The following are NOT considered research activities:
− supporting or financing research activities carried out by other entities
− promoting, managing or coordinating research activities.
Only entities that have research and/or development as their main objective can
qualify as research organisations. By contrast, entities that have research and/or
development as ancillary activities (even if regular and substantial, e.g. in museums
or hospitals) do not qualify as ‘research organisations’.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by entities, which
have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Secondary or higher education establishment
‘Secondary or higher education establishment’ means an entity that is recognised as
such by its national education system and is able to deliver diplomas recognised by
the State.
It can be a public body or a private entity (see above). The national accreditation as a
secondary/higher education establishment is not sufficient to consider the entity as a
public body.
This status is self-declared.
2.2 Documents and information to provide
2.2.1 General requirements and principles
The legal validation of entities is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participants as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
by the participants on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (can be
required by the EU services at any time).
In principle only official documents are accepted. Documents are considered as official
when they are delivered by official national authorities. Official documents can NOT be
replaced by self-declarations or by sworn or solemn statements before judicial or
administrative authorities, notaries or public officers.
As a general rule, documents are accepted in any of the EU official languages.
Participants may however be requested to submit an English free (unofficial)
translation to facilitate the validation process. Documents in non-EU languages will be
accepted only if accompanied by a free translation in English (and in case of doubt, a
14EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
certified/legal translation in English may be requested). Free translations should
always be accompanied by the copies of the original official documents.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as for any information provided by other means
(e.g. by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
2.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Signed legal entity identification form7:
− Natural Person Form: in English
− Private Legal Entity Form: in English
− Public Legal Entity Form: in English.
2. Official VAT document or — if the entity is not registered for VAT — the proof of
VAT exemption, not older than one (1) year.
For the specific legal statuses, participants will be asked to submit the following
additional documents:
Status Documents to be submitted
Private entity A valid registration extract not older than one (1) year.
Documents older than one year may be accepted if valid for a
(including SME and mid-cap)
certain period of time expressly indicated in the same
document (e.g. valid for two years) and if submitted via the
Participant Register within this period of time.
Public body Copy of the act, law, decree or decision that established the
entity as a public body (or, if this does not exist, any other
official legal document that proves this).
Natural person Integral copy (legible) of valid identity card or passport (e.g. in
case of identity card, both sides must be provided).

Entities without legal personality Copy of an official document attesting that the representatives
of the entity have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on
its behalf.
Copy of an official document attesting that the entity has the
same operational and financial viability as that of a legal entity:
i.e.

are separated and different from those of the
members/owners of the entity, and

owners/members.
Non-profit Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is non-
profit by its legal form or by its legal purpose, or that it has a

other elements.
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME) The following documents must be provided for the participant
and mid-caps and for its linked and partner entities (in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation

Sworn or solemn statements before a judicial or
administrative authority, notary or public officer cannot replace
the above listed documents as proof of the SME or mid-cap
status.
The following documents must be submitted in the below
specific cases:
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that
do not yet have closed accounts — Instead of approved
financial statements, a self-declaration must be provided,
including a bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan)
for the entire period (financial years) necessary for the entity to
generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long
time-to market — In addition to the approved financial
statements, a self-declaration must be provided, including a
bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan) for the
entire period (financial years) necessary to generate turnover,
including a declaration of the investment made and the likely
expected return (to demonstrate that, despite the lack of
turnover, the enterprise is engaged in an economic activity).
❖ Entities owned directly or indirectly by natural persons —
Self-declaration on the natural person(s) engagement in
economic activity and possible participations in other entities
must be provided. The template for the self-declaration will be
provided to participants during the validation process if specific
cases of ownership by natural persons are identified.

international public law.
Research organisation Copy of an official document attesting research or technological
development as the main objective of the entity.

the national education system and is entitled to deliver
(— if expressly requested by the Central
diplomas recognized by the State.
Validation Service)
For other categories such as NGO, Civil Society Organisation, etc no supporting
documents are needed (unless exceptionally requested by the Central Validation
Service).
2.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
17EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− the documents submitted are outdated (e.g. VAT document or extract of
registration no longer valid or more than one (1) year old)
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the validation (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
2.3 Validation and effective date
On the basis of the submitted information and documents, the participant will be
validated with the effective date of entry into force of the legal act establishing its
constitution or incorporation (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
That date will be, in order of precedence:
1. the date of registration in the country's’official registry (e.g. commercial
registry)
2. the date of publication in the national official journal
3. the date of the legal deposit of the act in the court registry
4. the date of signature of the parties.
When there is no act of constitution or incorporation, the participant will be
considered to exist since a standard default date.
The effective date for the SME and mid-cap status will be the accounts closure date of
the accounting period on which the assessment is based in accordance with Article
4(2) of the Annex of the SME Recommendation 2003/361. For newly established
enterprises that do not yet have closed accounts, the effective date is the date of
their creation.
The effective date of other specific legal statuses is the date in which the specific
status enters into force. This date may be the same as its effective date of
constitution or incorporation (or may differ, if the specific status has been acquired
later on).
2.4 Modification of validations
Modifications in the validation can be made in the following cases:
− following a request submitted by the participant to update the validation (e.g.
in case of changes in the participant’s legal situation such as change of
identity/legal form, name, address, status) or
− after checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out by the EU services
which necessitate a correction.
2.4.1 Validation updates
In case of a change in the participant’s legal situation (identity/legal form, name,
address, status, etc), the participant must request an update of the validation.
18EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Requests to update a validation will be accepted, if submitted by the participant’s
LEAR and accompanied by the relevant supporting documents. If no LEAR has
been appointed yet in the Participant Register, requests for modification should be
submitted after the LEAR appointment has been validated.
The ‘effective date of the change’ will be the date on which the act establishing the
change enters into force (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
For SMEs and mid-caps, the effective date is the closure date of the accounting period
on which the change of status is based. For cases of mergers and acquisitions that
lead to the loss of the SME or mid-cap status, the effective date of change will be the
date when the ownership structure changed.
The impact and practical consequences of the changes depend on each funding
programme.
2.4.2 Corrections of validations
If a validation turns out to beincorrect (through an audit, ex-post check, investigation
or other means), it will be corrected by the Central Validation Service. The correction
will be registered with effect back to the effective date of the initial validation.
If the error is attributable to the Central Validation Service and its correction implies
disadvantages for the participant, the retroactive effect may exceptionally be waived,
if duly justified and in line with the principles of sound financial management and
proportionality.
If the error was the fault of the participant (intentional or unintentional), its
participation in on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc
may be terminated and undue amounts paid may be recovered. Moreover, the
participant may be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements,
prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial
Regulation). In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
2.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If they find out that a participant did not meet the criteria for being validated or for
being validated with a specific legal status (e.g. due to false declarations), the
modification of the validation will be registered with retroactive effect back to the
effective date of the validation.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc, their participation may be terminated/withdrawn and
undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.

3. Validation of the LEAR appointment
3.1 Validation of the LEAR appointment: General requirements and principles
In parallel with the legal entity validation, the Central Validation Service will contact
the participants to appoint their Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR), i.e.
the single point of contact needed for the Participant Register and Funding & Tenders
Portal electronic exchange system.
The appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register is mandatory for all
validated participants. Without LEAR it will NOT be possible to update the legal entity
data in the Participant Register, nor sign contracts electronically in the Funding &
Tenders Portal.
3.1.1 Role of the LEAR
The LEAR is the person officially appointed by the participant to handle their access
rights and key data in the Participant Register (legal and other data, certain access
rights in the electronic exchange system, etc.).
Once validated, it is the LEAR who is responsible for giving access rights to the Portal
electronic exchange system and who must ensure that the participant’s legal
information is always up to date.
The LEAR must enter and update on the ‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen the names
of the:
− legal representatives and signatories for the organisation (so-called ‘LSIGNs’);
these are people who are able to commit the organisation legally by signing
contracts and authorising amendments to them and
− persons that may sign cost statements on behalf of the organisation (so-called
‘FSIGNs’).
If needed, the LEARs can delegate their tasks to one or more colleagues, who will act
as account administrators (so-called ‘AccAds’; delegation also through the
‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen).
In case of changes, the LEAR must encode the change in the Participant Register and,
if needed, request validation and provide supporting documents.
For a detailed description of the LEAR rights and responsibilities, see the LEAR
appointment letter*.
3.1.2 Position of the LEAR
The LEAR is an administrative function that may be held by the participant’s legal
representative or another key person within the entity.
The LEAR must be someone employed in the entity (most commonly in the central
administrative services of the entity) and should be able to ensure the stability and
continuity that is needed to fulfil this role in order to honour the participant’s
contractual obligations.
Participants that are natural persons will automatically have the role of LEAR; in this
case the role cannot be attributed to a different person (but the LEAR can appoint an
account administrator).
20EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Each participant can only appoint one LEAR and must ensure to immediately replace
their LEAR in case they are no longer able to exercise the role (e.g. job change,
dismissal, death, etc; see section 3.3).
The participant assumes the full responsibility for the choice of the person they
appoint as LEAR.
3.1.3 Legal representative
The LEAR must be appointed by the participant’s legal representative. The legal
representative is a person duly authorised to act on behalf of the entity and to
commit it in its entirety vis-à-vis third parties.
Specific cases
❖ Persons tasked with the daily management — Can not be recognized as legal
representatives if they are not entitled to engage and represent the entity outside
ordinary day-to-day business matters.
The ‘daily management’ (‘gestion journalière’) is commonly understood as comprising
those acts that, because of their minor importance or the need for a prompt solution,
do not justify the intervention of the management bodies. It consists of ordinary
business and execution of day-to-day decisions and in line with the general
instructions of the management board.
❖ Limitations — Similarly, persons empowered to engage and commit the
participant only within certain limits (including financial limits) can not be accepted as
legal representatives for the purposes of the LEAR appointment.
3.1.4 Timing of the LEAR appointment
The process for appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register can run in parallel
to the validation of the entity, but can only be finalised once the participant (PIC) is
validated.
LEAR appointment is not a condition for the submission of a proposal/tender in the
Funding & Tenders Portal, but its validation must be completed before the the grant,
procurement or contribution agreement can be signed.
3.2 List of documents and information
For the validation of the LEAR appointment, the scanned version of the following
documents must be uploaded by the participant in the Participant Register:
1. LEAR appointment letter* (specifying the LEAR roles & duties and including the
declaration of consent to the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and
Conditions*), completed, dated and signed by the legal representative and the
LEAR
2. Integral copy of an official, valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport, with
photo and signature) of:
− the legal representative and
− the appointed representative (LEAR)
3. Document(s) proving that the legal representative(s) appointing the LEAR is
empowered as such, which must:
21EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− clearly indicate the role/function within the organisation as legal
representative
− identify and appoint this person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
The originals must be kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which
can be required by the EU services at any time). They must not be sent to the Central
Validation Service.
After receiving the above-listed documents (and after the PIC has been validated),
the LEAR appointment will be validated in the Participant Register.
For a detailed description of the LEAR appointment process, see the Online Manual*
and the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions*.
Proof of identity
‘Identity documents’ are those issued by national authorities and recognized by
national law as valid proof of identity. Identity documents can not be replaced by any
other means of proof. The EU services cannot waive this requirement under any
circumstances.
Examples of identity documents accepted are ID cards and passports. Driving licenses
are also accepted, as long as they are considered as valid proof of identity under the
applicable national law of the entity concerned.
Identity documents must be valid (not expired) at the time of the LEAR appointment.
An integral copy of the document must be provided (e.g. in most countries both sides
of the identity card must be provided).
Identity documents in which some parts/elements, including the photo, have been
deleted/erased/covered (e.g. with black marker) cannot be accepted.
Specific cases
❖ Service cards and badges issued by the participant — Cannot replace identity
documents (even if the participant is a public body) and therefore cannot be accepted
as proof of identity.
❖ Print-outs from the ID electronic chip — Cannot be accepted either.
Signatures
The LEAR documents must be signed by persons who are legal representatives of the
participant.
The names of both legal representative and LEAR in the LEAR documents must
correspond to those indicated in their official identity documents. LEAR documents
signed with acronyms/nick names/etc that do not correspond to the names indicated
in the identity documents will not be accepted.
Signatures can be either handwritten signatures or qualified electronic signatures
22EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
within the meaning of Article 3(12) of Regulation 910/20148. For the latter, the
Central Validation Service will verify that the signature is based on a valid qualified
certificate and was created by a secure creation device. See here for the list of
accepted trust service providers: eIDAS Dashboard (europa.eu).
Specific cases
❖ Internal requirements (e.g. joint signature of more than one person required to
legally engage the entity, foreseen by law, act of establishment, statutes, internal
rules, etc) — In case of internal requirements, the participant is fully responsible for
ensuring compliance (e.g. through an internal process ensuring that the single
signature on the LEAR documents is made only after all the internal requirements on
joint signature are fulfilled).
❖ Limitations — The Central Validation Service will take into account limitations to
represent the entity only if these limitations are explicitly mentioned in the
documents submitted to prove the empowerment of the legal representative (e.g.
limitation in the excerpts of the company registry).
Documents proving the empowerment of the legal representative
The document(s) proving the empowerment must identify:
− the role/function of legal representative within the entity
− the name and appointment of the person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
This can be found in a single document (in case the official appointment also specifies
the powers/tasks related to the appointment) or in several documents combined (e.g.
the official act of appointment and the organisational document, such as act of
establishment, statutes, articles of association, etc, in which the powers/tasks related
to the role are identified).
The documents must be valid (not expired) at the time when the LEAR is appointed.
The documents proving the appointment of the legal representative are those
required/accepted under the applicable national law of the entity concerned. They
may vary depending on the country, the legal form and status:
− law/decree/official act/official gazette in case of public entities
− copy of the treaty in case of international organisations
− decision of assembly, official documents from the council of administration,
executive committee or directors board, excerpts of the company registry in
case of private entities.
A declaration of honour can be accepted only in exceptional, duly justified cases
where none of the above exists.
Concerning the language of such documents and participant's responsibilities
concerning translations, see section 2.2.1.
8 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on
electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 257,
28.8.2014, p. 73).
23EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Specific cases
❖ Participants who are natural persons — Do not need to prove their
empowerment, but still need to send the supporting documents listed above. The
documents should be signed by the natural person alone. A copy of the ID documents
of the natural person must also be included.
❖ Deputising persons — In case of temporary absence of the legal
representative(s) or their impossibility to sign, other persons empowered to act as
legal representatives (i.e. deputising persons) are accepted as legal representatives
by default. The reason for the temporary absence/impossibility and the legitimation of
the deputy will not be checked by the Central Validation Service and therefore
remains under the full responsibility of the participant (see also above under ‘internal
requirements’).
❖ Ministries — For ministries, Ministers are considered legal representatives by
default and there is no need to provide the legal documents proving their
empowerment.
In addition to the Minister's role, the following roles/functions are considered as legal
representatives by default, without any further verification of the legal documents
proving their empowerment:
− Deputy Minister
− State/General Secretary and their deputies
− Directors of certain specific horizontal sectors/departments/directions, namely
'legal', 'financial','European or international relationships'.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the ministry, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website of the ministry).
Except if otherwise provided in the applicable rules (law/decree/act governing the
organisation of the ministry), other roles such as ‘Director’/‘Had of Department’/‘Head
of Unit’, etc will be considered as having limited tasks and powers (relating only to
the directorate/department/unit’s policies) and, therefore, not entitled to represent
and engage the ministry as a whole.
For Ministers, the ID document can be exceptionally replaced by a badge or service
card (issued by the ministry). This exception applies only to the person of the
‘Minister’ and cannot be extended to other representatives (such as State Secretaries,
Deputy Ministers or Directors/Head of Departments); these persons are not exempted
from the obligation to provide an ID document.
❖ Public bodies and governmental entities — For public bodies and other
state/governmental entities, including executive services at central/regional/local
level, the highest-ranked person (e.g. Director-General, President, Mayor, etc) will be
recognized as legal representative by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the entity, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website).
❖ International organisations — For international organisations, the highest-
ranked person (e.g. Secretary, Secretary-General) will be recognised as legal
representative by default.
24EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the international organisation, the
evidence may also be taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the
organisational chart published on the official website of the international
organisation).
❖ Universities and higher education establishments — For universities and
other higher education establishments (e.g. colleges, institutes, etc), the following
roles/functions are recognised as legal representative by default, without any further
verification of their powers:
− Rector and Vice-Rector
− President and Vice-President
− Chancellor and Vice Chancellor.
In case of faculties with their own legal personality (and thus independently
validated), the Dean and Vice-Dean can also act as legal representatives by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the university/higher education
establishment/faculty, the evidence may also be taken from other appropriate
sources (e.g. the organisational chart published on the official internet-site of the
university/faculty).
3.3 LEAR replacement
A LEAR replacement is equivalent to a new LEAR appointment. For the replacement of
an already validated LEAR, participants must submit the same type of documents and
the Central Validation Service will follow the procedure for the validation of LEAR
appointment (see above).
3.4 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant did not respect the obligation to keep the original
documents or committed other irregularities, appropriate measures will be taken.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, or
contribution agreements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts
paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
4. Financial capacity assessment
4.1 Financial capacity assessment: Criteria and conditions
In addition to the legal entity validation and LEAR appointment, the Central Validation
Service also assists the EU services with the financial capacity assessment (required
by the Financial Regulation for grants and procurements; not needed for prizes or
contribution agreements).
25EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The financial capacity assessment must in principle be done for each new
application/tender (— unless the participant already has a valid financial capacity
assessment performed by the Central Validation Service that is not older than 18
months).
Additional conditions depend on the type of procedure (grant or procurement),
participant and grant amount (e.g. no financial capacity assessment is needed for
public bodies in grant procedures, for Member State organisations, international
organisations, persons in receipt of education support, persons most in need and in
receipt of direct support; for low-value grants and low-value procurements).
Additional exemptions are provided in some programmes for specific situations or
types of participants.
Moreover, the financial capacity may be assessed ad hoc if there are justified grounds
to doubt it, like for example:
− indication of weak/insufficient financial capacity from other sources
− involvement in cases of serious administrative errors or fraud
− pending legal procedures or judicial proceedings for serious administrative
errors or fraud
− attachment order or recovery order for an outstanding amount issued by an
EU body on which the payment is significantly overdue
− substantial findings in EU audits within the last 2 years that put in doubt the
financial capacity.
The financial capacity is assessed on the basis of financial indicators that are in
principle the same for all EU programmes.
The financial capacity assessment is normally done during grant preparation/tender
evaluation but may also be done during implementation. If a participants’ financial
capacity must be assessed, they will be contacted by the Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The role of the Central Validation Service is to prepare the financial capacity
assessment (e.g. to collect and to analyse the financial documents). The final decision
on the financial capacity will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender separately
by the EU service in charge.
4.2 Documents and information to provide
4.2.1 General requirements and principles
The financial assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the EU
services at any time).
As a general rule, financial documents must be provided in their original language(s),
as imposed by the legislation in the participant’s country of registration. For
documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit an English free
(unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in non-EU
languages, a free translation in English is always mandatory and needs to be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
26EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
Some examples of such documents are: dated and signed annual management
reports in English for a company listed on the stock exchange or having international
shareholders or for the purpose of consolidation within a foreign group; dated and
signed extracts from national registers that use English, etc.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as any information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw or correct the financial assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
4.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Profit and loss account — approved by the management of the entity, clearly
indicating the amounts of turnover from sales of goods and services, operating
income, staff, depreciation, amortization costs, net operating result and
interest expenses. If this information is not indicated in the profit and loss
account or in the explanatory notes it must be provided in the form of a self-
declaration.
2. Balance sheet statement — approved by the management, clearly indicating
the nature and the maturity (i.e. below or above one year) of receivables and
other current assets, grants, provisions and debts. If this information is not
indicated in the balance sheet or in the explanatory notes it must be provided
in the form of a self-declaration.
3. Explanatory notes and/or annexes that form part of the above financial
statements (if available).
4. External audit report or self-declaration
Participants requesting a grant amount of above 750 000 EUR (for action
grants) or above 100 000 EUR (for operating grants) must provide:
− an statutory audit report issued by an approved/certified external
auditor if:
− such a report is available or
− a statutory audit is required under EU or national law
or
27EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− a declaration on the validity of the accounts* (self-declaration), signed
by the legal representative of the entity, which certifies the validity of
the accounts.
The documents provided must cover the last two closed financial years. The most
recent year must have been closed within the last 18 months.
Exceptions are allowed for:
− start-up companies without closed annual accounts which provide
prospective data (business plan) for one year only
− recently created entities which have closed annual accounts for one year
only. These entities will be assessed based on the documents for the sole
closed financial year
A single financial document containing comparative data of the annual accounts of
both years under assessment will be accepted. The same applies to an external audit
report covering the two financial years.
If some (or all) of the documents have already been provided for the financial years
in question (i.e. uploaded in the Participant Register), the participant does not need
to submit them again.
The audit report must include:
− the clear mandate and scope of the audit
− the responsibilities of the management and the auditor
− the way in which the audit is carried out
− the auditor’s opinion, including a reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
All documents must be provided simultaneously (profit and loss account, balance
sheet, audit report/self-declaration, etc).
No audit report/self-declaration is needed for entities participating in tender
procedures, for natural persons and entities without closed accounts.
Specific cases
❖ Subsidiaries without own financial statements — Subsidiaries which do not
prepare their own financial statements may provide the consolidated accounts and
the audit report/self-declaration of the parent company/group they belong to under
the following conditions:
− the entity is exempt under national law from statutory audits
− only consolidated statements of the parent company/group the entity belongs
to are available
and
− the parent company assumes joint liability for all the debts of the entity (— all
conditions must be fulfilled).
In such cases, participants will be requested to provide additional documents to prove
these conditions.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
❖ Parent companies — Parent companies which are exempt under national law
from publishing individual (i.e. non-consolidated) financial statements will be
requested to provide a dated and signed by the management simplified summary of
their non-consolidated profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
These simplified accounts must respect either the minimum reporting requirements
set out in the national accounting law or Annexes III, IV, V and VI of Directive
2013/349 (for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings
preceded by letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
If the provided financial information is not sufficiently clear, the Central Validation
Service may contact participants for further clarifications.
❖ Newly established enterprises that have not yet closed accounts — Must
provide estimated financial data (i.e. a business plan or a similar document including
financial projections on current and non-current assets, own capital, current and non-
current liabilities, turnover, operating and financial income and charges).
The financial data must respect either the minimum reporting requirements set out in
the national accounting law or to Annexes III, IV, V and VI of EU Directive 2013/34
(for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings preceded by
letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
❖ Natural persons engaged in an economic activity who do not prepare financial
statements in relation to their business activities — Are requested to provide:
− the annual income tax declaration containing details on the revenues and
expenses from business activity
− a signed declaration of patrimony, including:
− fixed patrimony (e.g. land, tenement, hereditament, medium/long-term
deposits (more than one year), stock options that cannot be exercised
within one year)
− current patrimony (e.g. available cash, savings, short-term deposits
(maximum of one year), stock-options that can be exercised within one
year)
and
− a signed declaration of debts, which must contain all liabilities (with dates and
figures), broken down in short-term debts (of maximum one year) and
medium/long-term debts (of more than one year).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities operating cash-based accounting — If the available financial
documents do not contain a profit and loss account and a balance sheet but are
limited to a cash flow statement and/or do not contain sufficient information10,
9 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual
financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of
undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and
repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19–76).
10 E.g. missing information on the nature of revenues, expenses or equity, nature and liquidity of
receivables and assets, maturity of debts etc.
29EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
declarations signed by the authorised legal representative of the entity may be
accepted, if they provide:
− information on fixed and current assets: buildings, equipment, inventory, cash,
short/long term11 deposits, short/long term receivables, sort/long term
liabilities, grants and equity/sources of funding, etc
− information on revenues and expenses, such as turnover from sales of goods
and services, operating income, staff expenses depreciation/amortisation
costs, interest expenses, etc.
In addition, it is recommended to provide any available evidence supporting the
declared amounts (e.g. bank statements confirming the available balance at
accounting closure date, etc).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities covered by a guarantor — Entities that are covered by a full financial
guarantee of another legal entity (i.e. guarantor) may submit the financial data of the
guarantor, provided that it is a full guarantee (i.e. the guarantor has assumed full
joint liability for all debts). Ad-hoc guarantees (covering, for instance, only the
participation in EU projects) cannot be accepted.
Participants that would like to have the financial capacity of their guarantor
assessed, must first contact the service in charge of their application for approval of
the guarantee. In case of approval, the service in charge will request the Central
Validation Service to proceed with the assessment of the guarantor.
4.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
If the financial documents do not contain sufficient information regarding the nature
and the maturity of the current assets, provisions and liabilities, and such information
is not provided, the financial assessment will be completed by taking the most
prudent approach, e.g. by considering the maturity of the current assets to be after
one year, and of the provisions and liabilities to be within one year.
11 Short term — maximum of one year; long term — more than one year.
30EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The financial assessment is valid for 18 months after the closure date of the most
recent assessed accounting period. If during this period the participant applies for
another grant or tender, the financial documents will not be requested again.
However, if there are justified grounds to doubt the financial capacity, a new
assessment may be triggered even before the end of the 18 months.
4.4 Modification of the assessment
In case of disagreement with the assessment, the participant may contact the Central
Validation Service by sending additional justifications via Participant Register
message. The subject of the message should be clearly labelled as related to the
financial assessment (not PIC validation, LEAR assessment or other).
The Central Validation Service will carry out a re-assessment on the basis of the
additional documents.
4.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant made false declarations, their status may be
changed.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants or procurements, their
participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
5. Ownership control assessment
5.1 Ownership control assessment: Criteria and conditions
For funding programmes which have restricted calls in which only participants which
are directly or indirectly controlled by EU Member States or by nationals of EU
Member States (or by entities or nationals of specified eligible countries) are eligible,
the Central Validation Service will also handle the ownership control assessment
analysis.
The ownership control assessment must in principle be done for each new grant,
procurement or contribution agreement (— unless the participant already has a valid
ownership control assessment in the system performed by the Central Validation
Service that is not older than 18 months).
Moreover, the ownership control may be assessed ad hoc if there are grounds
justifying a new assessment, like for example:
− indication of third country control from other sources
− indication of ownership control changes after the initial assessment.
31EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The ownership control assessment will usually look into both ownership and control
elements, in order to assess whether an entity is EU controlled or non-EU controlled.
The focus is however on control (see Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and
CEF-DIG restricted calls*).
In this context, ‘control’ will be defined as the possibility to exercise decisive influence
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate entities, ‘de jure’ or ‘de facto’.
The fact that no influence is actually exercised is not relevant, as long as the
possibility exists.
Control will be assessed at the level of the ultimate ownership and control line and all
intermediate layers (in case of indirect control), taking into consideration decision-
making mechanisms, corporate governance, shareholders’/members’ rights, etc.
The assessment is based on the information provided by the participant in the
ownership control declaration* (annexed to their application for EU funding or
procurement procedure) and supporting documents to be provided by the participant
during the ownership control assessment procedure.
The role of the Central Validation Service is limited to identifying instances of
possible non-EU-country/entity control (e.g. to collect and to analyse the supporting
documents). The final decision will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender
separately by the EU service in charge, in accordance with the specific programme
rules.If needed, during grant preparation, the EU service in charge may contact
participants about the outcome of the ownership control assessment.
5.2 Documents and information to provide
5.2.1 General requirements and principles
The ownership control assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by
the participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be
kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the
EU services at any time).
As a general rule, ownership control documents must be provided in their original
language. For documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit
an English free (unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in
non-EU languages, a free translation in English is mandatory and must be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
The participant assumes full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as the information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
32EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
5.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Graph visualising the complete ownership structure/chain of control, including
all ownership layers/chain of control until the ultimate owners.
2. Proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners and their respective
percentage of interest and voting rights, for instance commercial registry
extracts, articles of association/incorporation documents/memorandum of
association/company’s shareholders/members/partners book/registry extract,
etc with the exact distribution of shares/voting rights, i.e. name of
shareholders/members/partners and their percentage of interest andvoting
rights, as well as information on their place of establishment (in case of legal
entity) or nationality (in case of natural persons).
3. Statutes, articles of association, shareholders’/partnership agreements,
memorandum of understanding among shareholders, investment agreements
between shareholders and other relevant documents regarding the decision-
making procedures within the legal entity and the related rights of the
shareholders/members/partners.
4. Documents establishing/describing the decision-making bodies, rules regarding
election, appointment, nomination, dismissal and tenure of members, and
decision-making procedures (e.g. articles of association, bylaws, reports on
corporate governance, internal corporate governance rules, minutes of board
meetings, etc).
5. For participants that are listed companies, subsidiaries or controlled by a listed
company: report/minutes of the last three shareholders meetings, together
with the attendance list identifying the present/represented shareholders and
their respective votes.
6. Cooperation agreements with customers or suppliers, when they could confer
control over the participant — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
7. For shareholders/owners that provide financial contributions: supporting
documents (loans, by-laws, etc) that justify the financial contribution;
documents showing the link between the shareholder/owner and the entity
providing the financing — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
8. Information about any other means, process or links that could ultimately
confer control to a non-EU country or non-EU country entity.
9. Copy of ID card(s) or passport(s) indicating the nationality of the ultimate
owner(s).
The same documents and information must be provided for each intermediate
controlling entity, up to the ultimate owners. The supporting documents must
demonstrate the complete ownership structure, including all layers of ownership and
non-controlling entities.
33EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Guarantees for non-EU controlled entities (if allowed by the call conditions and
required by the EU service in charge) are not part of the ownership control
assessment and must therefore be submitted directly to the EU service in charge of
the grant/tender, in accordance with the specific programme rules.
5.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
not to finalise the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and
documents submitted or publicly available).
5.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The ownership control assessment is in principle valid for 18 months. If during this
period the participant applies for another grant or tender and confirms that the
ownership control status has not changed, the supporting documents will not be
requested again.
In this case, the participants will still have to submit the ownership control
declaration with the application, but there will be no check by the Central Validation
Service, unless there are justified grounds to doubt the declaration.
5.4 Modification of the assessment
Changes in the ownership control status need to be communicated to the granting
authority/contracting authority, which will trigger a new assessment by the Central
Validation Service, if needed.
For more information on the ownership control assessment procedure, see the
Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and CEF-DIG restricted calls*.

EU FUNDING & TENDERS PORTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE
1.1 The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is an electronic portal and exchange
system managed by the European Commission and used by itself and several
other EU services (together ‘EU’), for the management of EU funding/tenders (i.e.
grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, experts, etc).
1.2 It is currently open to:
− users applying for or managing EU grants, tenders and prizes
− entities entering into EU contribution agreements
− external experts and audit firms appointed to work for the EU in the
context of EU funding programmes
and allows them to:
− register (in the Participant Register or Expert Data Base) and view and
edit their data
− create, revise and submit proposals for funding and tenders
− prepare and sign contracts
− manage their projects and contracts (e.g. submit deliverables, reports
and payment requests)
− for experts: perform their tasks inside the system (evaluation,
monitoring, etc)
− for external audit firms: perform their tasks inside the system (audit
management).
1.3 These Terms and Conditions govern the relation between the following parties:
− the European Commission (as owner of the Portal)
and
− users
in relation to access and use of the Portal.
For the avoidance of doubt, it does not cover the terms and conditions related to
the grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements or expert contracts that
are managed through the Portal; those are governed by their own legal framework
and contractual arrangements.
1.4 Requesting access to the Portal, accessing the Portal or using the Portal signifies
unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
Users will be requested to agree explicitly to the Terms and Conditions on their first
login to the Portal.
For users acting on behalf of organisations, the legal representatives of the
organisations will also be asked to explicitly agree at the moment they appoint their
LEAR/EXAFs (through the ‘declaration of consent’; see below).
3EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Organisations must provide their LEAR/EXAFs, LSIGNs and FSIGNs with a copy of
these Terms and Conditions.
Users are responsible for regularly verifying the applicable Terms and Conditions.
1.5 These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the
European Commission and users, as regards the conditions for access and use of
the Portal.
2. ACCESS TO THE PORTAL
2.1 Users
2.1.1 Access to the public parts of the Portal is open to all users.
2.1.2 Access to the Portal electronic exchange system (EES) is open only to persons
with an EU Login account.
2.1.3 Access rights to certain information and functions in the EES are restricted to
users with specific roles (which are in turn linked to their functions within their
organisation or in relation to a particular
proposal/project/grant/contract/agreement).
2.1.4 Organisations can access the EES only via individual users employed by or
representing them.
2.2 Means of access to the EES — EU Login user account
2.2.1 Users must obtain an EU Login account in accordance with the applicable
procedures.
Users who already have an EU Login account must use that account.
2.2.2 Users guarantee that the information provided for registration for the account is
accurate and complete.
The European Commission has — at any time — the right to verify the accuracy
and validity of the information.
If this reveals any inaccuracy or invalidity, the European Commission has the right
to close the account and suspend or refuse access.
2.2.3 The means of access (i.e. the user name and password) are strictly personal and
users are responsible for safeguarding their confidentiality and security, and
ensuring their appropriate use.
Users undertake to take all steps to prevent any unauthorised third party from
gaining knowledge and making use thereof.
Users may not transfer or sell their means of access to third parties.
Users must notify the European Commission immediately (via the IT Helpdesk;
see Funding & Tenders Portal Support menu) of the loss, theft, breach of
confidentiality or any risk of misuse of the means of access.
If the European Commission has any reason to suspect that the confidentiality or
security of the means of access has been breached or that the EES is being
misused, it may — without prior notice — suspend or refuse access.

2.4 LEAR appointment
2.4.1 Organisations using the EES for transactions requiring electronic signatures are
required to appoint a LEAR.
2.4.2 Individuals (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons) will automatically have the
role of LEAR (no appointment needed); but they will have to provide the
supporting documents. Organisations can appoint only one LEAR — who can be
replaced if necessary, following the same appointment process.
2.4.3 Organisations warrant that the person appointed as LEAR is duly authorised to
represent them in relation to all LEAR responsibilities.
Organisations are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of the LEAR
responsibilities and to ensure that the LEAR remains at all times duly authorised
to represent them in relation to these responsibilities.
2.4.4 Supporting documents must be provided directly in the system.
2.4.5 Signed originals must be kept on file for controls (which may take place at any
moment and independently of any ongoing grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements or expert contracts).
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to the closure of the EU Login
account and suspension and refusal of access (and possibly termination of ongoing
grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements and expert contracts).
2.5 Appointment of signatories in the EES — (P)LSIGNs and (P)FSIGNs
2.5.1 The LEAR must appoint one or more LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation.

General Annexes
INTRODUCTION
These General Annexes set out the general conditions applicable to calls and topics for grants
and other forms of funding under the Horizon Europe main work programme. They also
describe the evaluation and award procedures and other criteria for Horizon Europe funding.
In particular, the General Annexes outline the:
– admissibility and eligibility criteria for participation and for receiving funding, the
criteria for having the financial and operational capacity and for exclusion (Annexes
A-C);
– award criteria, mandatory documents and evaluation procedure (Annexes D-F);
– legal and financial set-up of the grant agreements (Annex G);
– specific conditions applying to actions which include pre-commercial procurement or
procurement of innovative solutions (Annex H).
If a topic deviates from the general conditions or includes additional conditions, this is
explicitly stated under the specific conditions for the topic.
Applicants are invited to read the call documentation on the topic page of the Funding &
Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) carefully, and particularly these General Annexes, the Horizon
Europe Programme Guide1, the EU Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual2 and the EU
Grants AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement3. These documents provide clarifications and
answers to questions on preparing the application.
Please note that calls launched by the European Research Council (ERC), the European
Innovation Council (EIC), the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the
Institutionalised European Partnerships based on Articles 185 and 187 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), calls under the Euratom Research and Training
Programme and the activities of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) are
subject to separate work programmes and thus not covered by these General Annexes.
1 The Horizon Europe Programme Guide outlines the detailed guidance on the structure, budget and political
priorities of Horizon Europe.
2 The Online Manual outlines the procedures to register and submit applications online via the EU Funding &
Tenders Portal and recommendations on preparing the application.
3 The AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement contains detailed annotations on all the provisions in the grant
agreement that must be signed to obtain the grant.

General Annexes
GENERAL CONDITIONS
A — Admissibility
Admissibility
Applications must be submitted before the call deadline.
Applications must be submitted electronically via the Funding & Tenders Portal electronic
submission system (accessible via the topic page in the Search Funding & Tenders section).
Paper submissions are NOT possible.
Applications must be submitted using the forms provided inside the electronic submission
system (not the templates available on the topic page, which are only for information). The
structure and presentation must correspond to the instructions given in the forms.
Applications must be complete and contain all parts and mandatory Annexes and supporting
documents (see Annex E below).
Applications must be readable, accessible and printable.
Applications must include a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results
including communication activities, unless provided otherwise in the specific call/topic
conditions. The plan is not required for applications at the first stage of two-stage procedures.
If the expected exploitation of the results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and
marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan must include a
strategy for such exploitation. If the plan provides for exploitation of the results primarily in
non-associated third countries, the applicants must explain how that exploitation is to be
considered in the EU’s interest.
Applicants submitting a proposal under the blind evaluation pilot (see Annex F below) must
not disclose their organisation names, acronyms, logos nor names of personnel in Part B of
their first-stage application (see Annex E below).
Page limits
In addition to the above admissibility conditions, page limits will apply to parts of
applications. The page limits, and sections subject to limits, will be clearly shown in the
application templates in the Funding & Tenders Portal electronic submission system.
Unless provided otherwise in the specific call/topic conditions, the limit for a full
application is 45 pages (except for ‘Coordination and support’ actions, where the limit is 30
pages, and for ‘Programme co-fund’ actions, where the limit is 70 pages). For topics using
lump sum funding, the limit for ‘Research and Innovation’ actions and ‘Innovation’ actions is
50 pages and the limit for ‘Coordination and support’ action is 33 pages.
The limit for a first-stage application is 10 pages.
Page 4 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
If an application exceeds the limits, there will be an automatic warning and invitation to re-
submit a version that conforms to these limits. After the call deadline, excess pages will be
automatically made invisible, and will not be taken into consideration by the evaluators.
B — Eligibility
Entities eligible to participate
Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-
associated third countries or international organisations (including international European
research organisations4) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not),
provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation5 have been met,
along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call/topic.
A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under
national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting
in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal
personality6.
Beneficiaries and affiliated entities must register in the Participant Register before submitting
their application, in order to get a participant identification code (PIC) and be validated by the
Central Validation Service before signing the grant agreement. For the validation, they will be
asked to upload the necessary documents showing their legal status and origin during the
grant preparation stage. A validated PIC is not a prerequisite for submitting an application.
For more information, see Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Specific cases:
Affiliated entities — Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a
beneficiary7 which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the
beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become
beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
Associated partners — Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action
without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim
contributions) are allowed, subject to any specific call/topic conditions.
Entities without legal personality — Entities which do not have legal personality under their
national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the
4 ‘International European research organisation’ means an international organisation, the majority of whose
members are Member States or Associated Countries, and whose principal objective is to promote scientific and
technological cooperation in Europe.
5 Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing
Horizon Europe (OJ L 170 , 12.5.2021, p. 1).
6 See Article 197(2)(c) EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.

capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the
EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons8.
EU bodies — Legal entities created under EU law including decentralised agencies may be
part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
Joint Research Centre (‘JRC’)— Where provided for in the specific call/topic conditions,
applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC
will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate
the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text.
After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an
agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the
JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate
as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European
research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or
‘beneficiaries without legal personality’9. However, if the action is in practice implemented
by the individual members, those members should also participate either as beneficiaries or as
affiliated entities (otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible).
Restrictions on participation in Innovation Actions — In accordance with the 2019 “EU-
China - A Strategic outlook” communication, the 2021 “Global Approach to Research and
Innovation” communication, and the joint conclusions of the 4th EU-China Innovation
Cooperation Dialogue of 2019, an exercise to develop a Joint Roadmap for the future of EU-
China cooperation in science, technology, and innovation (Roadmap) has been established
between the EU and China. It has the objective to develop a level playing field for
engagement between the EU and China in the areas of science, technology, and innovation
(STI) that is respectful of fundamental research and innovation values and principles. This
endeavor is to be achieved through an agreement on the framework conditions contained in
the Roadmap and their monitoring and evaluation. As progress so far has mainly taken place
on the framework conditions linked to research rather than on those related to innovation, and
taking into account the nature and objectives in particular of Innovation Actions, cooperation
with entities established in China needs to be calibrated accordingly.
Legal entities established in China are therefore not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe
Innovation Actions in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated
entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or
recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-
by-case basis for justified reasons. The above eligibility criteria may be reviewed in the future
in accordance with policy developments. This exclusion is justified under Article 22(6) of the
Horizon Europe Regulation given the substantive concerns regarding the use of intellectual
property generated under this publicly funded programme, and the ongoing discussions
8 See Article 197(2)(c) EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.

Restrictions for the protection of European communication networks — The protection
of European communication networks has been identified as an important security interest of
the Union and its Member States.10 In line with the Commission Recommendation on the
cybersecurity of 5G networks of 201911 and the subsequent report on EU coordinated risk
assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G networks of 2019, 12 the EU Toolbox on 5G
cybersecurity,13 the second report on Member States’ progress in implementing the EU
toolbox on 5G cybersecurity of 2023,14 and the related Communication on the implementation
of the 5G cybersecurity toolbox of 2023,15 the Commission together with the Member States
has worked to jointly identify and assess cyberthreats and security risks for 5G networks.16
The toolbox also recommends adding country-specific information (e.g. threat assessment
from national security services, etc.). This work is an essential component of the Security
Union Strategy and supports the protection of electronic communications networks and other
critical infrastructures.
Entities assessed as “high-risk suppliers”, are currently set out in the second report on
Member States’ progress in implementing the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity of 202317 and
the related Communication on the implementation of the 5G cybersecurity toolbox of 202318.
The toolbox also underlines that further developing European capacities in the area of 5G and
post-5G technologies by leveraging EU Research & Innovation Funding programmes is a
strategic risk mitigating measure. This entails the need to avoid the participation of high-risk
supplier entities in the development of other technologies linked to the evolution of European
communication networks to prevent technology transfer and the persistence of dependencies
in materials, semiconductor components (including processors), computing resources,
software tools and virtualisation technologies, as well as related cybersecurity.
In order to protect the specific policy requirements of the Union and/or its Member States, it
is therefore appropriate that the following additional eligibility criteria apply to actions
identified as “subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication networks”
and to proposals within the MSCA part 19 that concern the evolution of European
communication networks (5G, post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of
European communication networks):

General Annexes
Entities that are assessed as high-risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment
(and any entities they own or control) are not eligible to participate as beneficiaries, affiliated
entities and associated partners.
The assessment is based on the following criteria:
• likelihood of interference from a non-associated third country, for example due to:
− the characteristics of the entity’s ownership or governance (e.g. state-owned or
controlled, government/party involvement);
− the characteristics of the entity’s business and other conduct (e.g. a strong link to a
third country government);
− the characteristics of the respective third country (e.g. legislation or government
practices likely to affect the implementation of the action, including an offensive
cyber/intelligence policy, pressure regarding place of manufacturing or access to
information).
• (cyber-)security practices, including throughout the entire supply chain;
• risks identified in relevant assessments of Member States and third countries as well as
other EU institutions, bodies and agencies, if relevant.
Exceptions may be requested from the granting authority and will be assessed case-by-case,
taking into account the criteria provided for in the 5G cybersecurity toolbox, the security risks
and availability of alternatives in the context of the action.
Restrictions on participation or control — For actions related to EU strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security, the specific topic conditions may limit participation to legal
entities established only in EU Member States or in EU Member States and specific
associated or non-associated third countries. In this case, the eligible countries will be
identified in the specific call/topic conditions. In addition, for duly justified and exceptional
reasons, to guarantee protection of the strategic interests of the EU and its Member States, the
specific call/topic conditions may also exclude the participation of legal entities directly or
indirectly controlled by non-eligible third countries or by legal entities of non-eligible third
countries (or make their participation subject to specific conditions), in line with Article 22(5)
of the Horizon Europe Regulation.
EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of
the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of
the EU (TFEU)20 as well as Article 75 TFEU21, are not eligible to participate in any capacity,
including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind
contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).

General Annexes
Special rules also apply to entities covered by Commission Guidelines No 2013/C 205/0522.
Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories
of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of
Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions
foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-
government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not
subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any
capacity23. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners,
third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to
third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the
rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506,
as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public
interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain.
Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals. However, as long as the
Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role
(beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third
parties, etc). In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or
replace that entity and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be
redistributed accordingly.

Legal entities which are established in countries not listed above will be eligible for funding if
provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered
essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
Specific cases:
Affiliated entities — Affiliated entities are eligible for funding if they are established in one
of the countries listed above, or in a country identified in the specific call/topic conditions.
Associated partners — Entities not eligible for funding (and therefore not able to participate
as beneficiaries) may participate as associated partners, unless specified otherwise in the
specific call/topic conditions.
Coordination and Support Actions – To be eligible to participate as beneficiaries (or
affiliated entities) in ‘Coordination and support’ actions, legal entities must be established in a
Member State or Associated Country, unless the specific call/topic conditions provide
otherwise (in which case the general rules for eligibility for funding apply). Legal entities
established in a non-associated third country may, however, participate in ‘Coordination and
support’ actions as associated partners, unless this is explicitly excluded by the specific
call/topic conditions.
EU bodies — Legal entities created under EU law may also be eligible to receive funding,
unless their basic act states otherwise.
International organisations — International European research organisations are eligible to
receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or
Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or
when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are
not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if
their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting
authority.
Consortium composition
Unless otherwise provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, only legal entities forming
a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as

beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a
different country as follows:
− at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
− at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member
States or Associated Countries.
As affiliated entities do not sign the grant agreement, they do not count towards the minimum
eligibility criteria for consortium composition (if any).
The Joint Research Centre, international European research organisations and legal entities
created under EU law are deemed to be established in a Member State other than those in
which the other legal entities participating in the action are established.
Applications for ‘Training and mobility’ actions and for ‘Programme co-fund’ actions may be
submitted by one or more legal entities, provided that one of those legal entities is established
in a Member State or an Associated Country.
Applications for ‘Coordination and support’ actions may be submitted by one or more legal
entities, which may be established in a Member State, Associated Country or, in exceptional
cases and if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, in another third country.
Applications for ‘Pre-commercial procurement’ actions and ‘Public procurement of
innovative solutions’ actions must also fulfil the eligibility criteria of three independent legal
entities as beneficiaries as explained above, out of which a minimum of two beneficiaries
must be independent legal entities that are public procurers29, each established in a different
Member State or Associated Country and with at least one of them established in a Member
State.
Eligible activities
Eligible activities are the ones described in the call conditions. Applications will only be
considered eligible if their content corresponds, wholly or in part, to the topic description for
which it is submitted.
Projects must focus exclusively on civil applications and must not:
– aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes;
– intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such changes
heritable (except for research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads, which may be
financed);
– intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research, or for the purpose
of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer.
29 ‘Public procurers’ are organisations that are contracting authorities or contracting entities as defined in EU
public procurement directives 2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU, and 2009/81/E.
Page 12 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Projects must, moreover, comply with EU policy interests and priorities (environment, social,
security, industrial policy, etc.).
The following activities are generally eligible for grants under Horizon Europe:
Research and innovation actions (RIA) — Activities that aim primarily to establish new
knowledge or to explore the feasibility of a new or improved technology, product, process,
service or solution. This may include basic and applied research, technology development and
integration, testing, demonstration and validation of a small-scale prototype in a laboratory or
simulated environment.
Innovation actions (IA) — Activities that aim directly to produce plans and arrangements or
designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services. These activities may
include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, large-scale product validation and
market replication.
Coordination and support actions (CSA) — Activities that contribute to the objectives of
Horizon Europe. This excludes research and innovation (R&I) activities, except those carried
out under the ‘Widening participation and spreading excellence’ component of the
programme (part of ‘Widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area’).
Also eligible are bottom-up coordination actions which promote cooperation between legal
entities from Member States and Associated Countries to strengthen the European Research
Area, and which receive no EU co-funding for research activities.
Programme co-fund actions (CoFund) — A programme of activities established or
implemented by legal entities managing or funding R&I programmes, other than EU funding
bodies. Such a programme of activities may support: networking and coordination; research;
innovation; pilot actions; innovation and market deployment; training and mobility;
awareness raising and communication; and dissemination and exploitation. It may also
provide any relevant financial support, such as grants, prizes and procurement, as well as
Horizon Europe blended finance30 or a combination thereof. The actions may be implemented
by the beneficiaries directly or by providing financial support to third parties.
Innovation and market deployment actions (IMDA) — Activities that embed an innovation
action and other activities necessary to deploy an innovation on the market. This includes the
scaling-up of companies and Horizon Europe blended finance.
Training and mobility actions (TMA) — Activities that aim to improve the skills, knowledge
and career prospects of researchers, based on mobility between countries and, if relevant,
between sectors or disciplines.
Pre-commercial procurement actions (PCP) — Activities that aim to help a transnational
buyers’ group to strengthen the public procurement of research, development, validation and,
30 ‘Horizon Europe blended finance’ means financial support for innovation and market deployment activities,
consisting of a specific combination of a grant or reimbursable advance and an investment in equity or any other
repayable form of support.

General Annexes
possibly, the first deployment of new solutions that can significantly improve quality and
efficiency in areas of public interest, while opening market opportunities for industry and
researchers active in Europe. Eligible activities include the preparation, management and
follow-up, under the coordination of a lead procurer, of one joint PCP and additional activities
to embed the PCP into a wider set of demand-side activities.
Public procurement of innovative solutions actions (PPI) — Activities that aim to
strengthen the ability of a transnational buyers’ group to deploy innovative solutions early by
overcoming the fragmentation of demand for such solutions and sharing the risks and costs of
acting as early adopters, while opening market opportunities for industry. Eligible activities
include preparing and implementing, under the coordination of a lead procurer, one joint or
several coordinated PPI by the buyers’ group and additional activities to embed the PPI into a
wider set of demand-side activities.
Technology Readiness Levels
Where the specific call/topic conditions require a Technology Readiness Level (TRL), the
following definitions apply, unless otherwise specified:
– TRL 1 — Basic principles observed
– TRL 2 — Technology concept formulated
– TRL 3 — Experimental proof of concept
– TRL 4 — Technology validated in a lab
– TRL 5 — Technology validated in a relevant environment (industrially relevant
environment in the case of key enabling technologies)
– TRL 6 — Technology demonstrated in a relevant environment (industrially relevant
environment in the case of key enabling technologies)
– TRL 7 — System prototype demonstration in an operational environment
– TRL 8 — System complete and qualified
– TRL 9 — Actual system proven in an operational environment (competitive
manufacturing in the case of key enabling technologies, or in space)
Ethics
Projects must comply with ethical principles (including the highest standards of research
integrity) and applicable EU, international and national law.
Applicants must have completed the ethics self-assessment as part of their application.
For more information, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment.
Page 14 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Projects involving ethics issues will have to undergo an ethics review to authorise funding and
may be made subject to specific ethics requirements. These requirements become part of the
grant agreement as ethics deliverables, e.g. ethics committee opinions/authorisations required
under national or EU law.
Security — EU classified and sensitive information
Projects involving classified and/or sensitive information will have to go through the security
appraisal process to authorise funding and may be made subject to specific security rules
(detailed in the Security Section, which is annexed to the grant agreement). Specific
provisions for EU classified information (EUCI) and sensitive information (SEN) will be
included in the grant agreement, as necessary and appropriate.
The rules for protecting EU classified information (governed by Commission Decision (EU,
Euratom) 2015/44431 and/or national rules) provide for instance that:
− projects involving information classified as TRES SECRET UE/EU TOP SECRET (or
equivalent) can NOT be funded;
− EU classified information must be marked in accordance with the applicable security
instructions in the Security Classification Guide appendix of the Security Aspects
Letter (SAL), which is contained in the Security Section of the grant agreement;
− generation of, or access to, information with classification levels CONFIDENTIEL
UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL or above (and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, if
required by national rules) may take place only on the premises of entities which have
been granted a facility security clearance (FSC) issued by the competent national
security authority (NSA);
− handling of information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL or
above (and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, if required by national rules) may
take place only in a secured area accredited by the competent NSA;
− access to and handling of information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU
CONFIDENTIAL or above may be granted only to individuals with a valid personnel
security clearance (PSC) and an established need-to-know, who have been briefed on
the applicable security rules;
− access to, and handling of, information classified RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED
may be granted only to individuals who have a need-to-know and have been briefed
on the applicable security rules;
− at the end of the grant, the classified information must either be returned or continue to
be protected according to the applicable rules;
31 See Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p. 53).
Page 15 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
− subcontracting of tasks involving EU classified information is subject to prior written
approval by the European Commission, which is the originator of EU classified
information. It is only possible to subcontract these tasks to entities established in an
EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of information agreement
with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the Commission);
− disclosure of EU classified information is subject to prior written approval by the
European Commission.
Depending on the type of activity, FSCs may have to be provided before the grant is signed.
The granting authority will assess this for each case and fix the delivery date during the grant
preparation stage. It is not possible to sign any grant agreement before at least one of the
beneficiaries in the consortium has an FSC.
In certain cases, the project results might not require classification, but they might be sensitive
and require restricted disclosure or limited dissemination for security reasons, according to the
applicable instructions in the Security Section. This means that, in principle, third parties
should have no access to results subject to this type of restriction. Disclosure of this
information is subject to prior written approval by the European Commission.
Further security recommendations may be added to the grant agreement in the form of
security deliverables (e.g. establishing a security advisory board, appointing a project security
officer, limiting the level of detail, using a fake scenario, etc.).
In addition, beneficiaries must ensure that their projects are not subject to national/third-
country security requirements that could affect implementation or put into question the award
of the grants (e.g. technology restrictions, national security classification, etc.). Any potential
security issues must be notified immediately to the granting authority.
Gender equality plans and gender mainstreaming
Beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities between men and women
in implementing the action and, where applicable, in line with their gender equality plan.
They must aim to achieve, to the extent possible, a gender balance at all levels of personnel
assigned to the action, including at supervisory and managerial level.
In addition, to be eligible, legal entities from Member States and Associated Countries that
are public bodies, research organisations or higher education establishments (including private
research organisations and higher education establishments) must have a gender equality plan,
covering the following minimum process-related requirements:
– publication: a formal document published on the institution’s website and signed by
the top management;
– dedicated resources: commitment of resources and expertise in gender equality to
implement the plan;
Page 16 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
– data collection and monitoring: sex/gender disaggregated data on personnel (and
students, for the establishments concerned) and annual reporting based on indicators;
– training: awareness raising/training on gender equality and unconscious gender biases
for staff and decision-makers.
Content-wise, it is recommended that the gender equality plan addresses the following areas,
using concrete measures and targets:
– work-life balance and organisational culture;
– gender balance in leadership and decision-making;
– gender equality in recruitment and career progression;
– integration of the gender dimension into research and teaching content;
– measures against gender-based violence, including sexual harassment.
A self-declaration will be requested at proposal stage. If all the above-mentioned mandatory
requirements are met through another strategic document, such as a development plan or an
inclusion or diversity strategy, it can be considered as an equivalent. This eligibility criterion
does not apply to other categories of legal entities, such as private for-profit organisations,
including SMEs, non-governmental or civil society organisations.
Financial support to third parties
Where the specific call/topic conditions allow for financial support to third parties, the
applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results,
including the elements listed in the application template. The following conditions must also
be fulfilled:
– projects must publish their open calls widely and adhere to EU standards of
transparency, equal treatment, conflict of interest and confidentiality;
– all calls for third parties and all calls that are implemented by third parties must be
published on the Funding & Tenders Portal, and on the beneficiaries’ websites;
– the calls must remain open for at least 2 months;
– if submission deadlines are changed, this must immediately be announced and
registered applicants must be informed of the change;
– projects must publish the outcome of the calls without delay, including a description
of third-party projects, the date of the award, the duration, and the legal name of the
third party and country of establishment;
– the calls must have a clear European dimension.
Further conditions may be stipulated in the specific conditions for the topic.

General Annexes
OTHER TYPES OF ACTIONS AND FORMS OF FUNDING
The following types of action and forms of funding are also used in Horizon Europe. They are usually placed in the
‘Other Actions’ section of the work programme parts and are not all subject to calls for proposals.
• Grants to identified beneficiaries — Exceptionally, a grant may be awarded to legal entities explicitly named
in the work programme without a prior call for proposals. The identified beneficiaries must nevertheless submit
a proposal to benefit from funding. This proposal will be evaluated and must meet the required threshold. The
funding rates will correspond to the type of action indicated.
• Prizes — Prize means a financial contribution given as a reward following a contest. Inducement prizes: a prize
to stimulate investment in a given area, by specifying a goal prior to the work being performed. Contests for
inducement prizes must address technological and/or societal challenges. The award criteria will define a goal,
but without prescribing how to achieve it. Contests for inducement prizes are split into awards for the contestant
that first meets the specific goal defined in the rules of the contest, and awards for the best contestant within a
given period. Recognition prizes: a prize to reward past achievements and outstanding work after it has been
performed. Recognition prizes must help to raise public awareness of EU policies, create role models and
support best practice exchange. The Rules of the contest of a specific prize provide for the admissibility,
eligibility, exclusion and award criteria, the prize amount and categories (if applicable) the evaluation
procedure, the indicative timetable and the modalities of payment. The rules are found on the call topic page on
the Funding & Tenders Portal.
• Framework partnerships and specific grant agreements — Framework partnerships are formalised long-
term cooperation mechanisms involving several or recurring grants. They must be based on jointly agreed action
plans and agreements that set out the terms and conditions for receiving grants to implement the actions,
framework partnership agreements (FPA) and specific grant agreements (SGA). The FPA will set out the
framework conditions governing potential grants to beneficiaries on the basis of an action plan and jointly
agreed general objectives. The SGA will set out the specific obligations and conditions to implement the
specific action. The FPA will have no budget; the budget and rules on funding will be set out in each SGA and
depend on the specific type of action. The establishment of an FPA must take place following a call for
proposals. Beneficiaries will be identified from the evaluation of the proposals. In a subsequent step,
beneficiaries may be invited to submit their proposals for the SGA. Framework partnerships do not give the
partners (i.e. potential beneficiaries) exclusive rights to be awarded the grants covered by the FPAs. SGAs must
only be signed if the FPA has been signed, and before the end date of the FPA.
• Operating grants — Operating grants provide financial support for the functioning of a body to enable it to
carry out specific activities set out in the agreed work programme. Operating grants do not support the
implementation of a specific action, but rather the annual operating budget (or part of it) for certain bodies
whose statutory activities serve the strategic objectives of EU policies. Operating grants will always be mono-
beneficiary grants supporting the work programme of only one organisation. Operating grants must follow the
same rules as described in Annex G, but they do not differentiate between direct and indirect costs. Receiving
an operating grant may make beneficiaries ineligible to receive indirect costs in all other EU action grants.
• Public procurement — In a public procurement action, the granting authority purchases works, supplies or
services, or acquires or rents land, buildings or other immovable property. This is done by entering into a
contract with an economic operator chosen by the granting authority. Before the granting authority enters into a
procurement contract, a call for tender is published on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
• Expert contract actions — Expert contracts are used to appoint independent expert(s) to advise or assist us.
Experts are used for evaluating proposals, for evaluating the programme, for ethics screenings and assessments,
for advisory bodies, and for expertise related to the objectives of Horizon Europe.
• Subscription actions — Subscription actions are used to pay contributions to bodies in which the EU is a
member or an observer.
• Scientific and technical services by the Joint Research Centre — Scientific and technical services cover
research and innovation activities undertaken by the Commission through its Joint Research Centre. These (non-
nuclear) activities are direct actions generating high-quality scientific evidence to support efficient and
affordable public policies. Horizon Europe’s rules for participation do not apply to these actions.
• Indirectly managed actions — Indirectly managed actions refer to actions implemented by entities which are
entrusted with implementing EU funds or budgetary guarantees through a contribution agreement.
• Service level agreement actions — These are actions implemented through a service level agreement. Service
level agreements include agreements between Commission departments or, agreements that the Commission
may conclude with another Union institution, Union body, or European office involving the provision of
services.

General Annexes
C — Financial and operational capacity and exclusion
Financial capacity
Applicants must have stable and sufficient resources to successfully implement the projects
and contribute their share. Organisations participating in several projects must have sufficient
capacity to implement all these projects.
The financial capacity check will be done on the basis of the documents uploaded in the
Participant Register during the grant preparation stage (e.g. profit and loss account and
balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an approved external auditor, certifying
the accounts for the last closed financial year, etc.). The analysis will be based on neutral
financial indicators, but will also take into account other aspects, such as dependency on EU
funding and deficit and revenue in previous years.
The check will normally be done for the coordinator if the requested grant amount is equal to
or greater than EUR 500 000, except for:
− public bodies (entities established as a public body under national law, including local,
regional or national authorities) or international organisations; and
− cases where the individual requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60 000 (low-
value grant).
If needed, it may also be done for the other applicants, including affiliated entities. If the
financial capacity is structurally guaranteed by another legal entity, the financial capacity of
that legal entity will be verified.
If the granting authority considers that the financial capacity is not satisfactory, they may
require:
− further information;
− an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility of
affiliated entities (see Annex G below); and
− prefinancing paid in instalments;
or
− propose no prefinancing;
− request that the applicant concerned is replaced or, if needed, reject the entire
proposal.
For more information, see Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Page 20 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Operational capacity
Applicants must have the know-how, qualifications and resources to successfully
implement their tasks in the project and contribute their share (including, when appropriate,
sufficient experience in EU/transnational projects of comparable size).
This assessment of operational capacity will be carried out during the evaluation of the award
criterion ‘Quality and efficiency of the implementation’. It will be based on the competence
and experience of the applicants and their project teams, including their operational resources
(human, technical and other) or, exceptionally, the measures proposed to obtain the necessary
competence and experience by the time the tasks are implemented.
If the evaluation of this award criterion leads to a score above the applicable threshold, then
the applicants are considered to have sufficient operational capacity.
For this assessment, applicants will be required to provide the following information in the
application form:
− description of the consortium participants; and
− for each participant:
– identity of researchers involved in the proposal (through the researchers table);
– up to five most relevant publications, widely-used datasets, software, goods,
services, or any other achievements relevant to the call content;
– up to five most relevant previous projects or activities, connected to the subject
of this proposal; and
– description of any significant infrastructure and/or any major items of technical
equipment, relevant to the proposed work.
Additional supporting documents may be requested if they are needed to confirm the
operational capacity of any applicant.
Public bodies, Member State organisations and international organisations are exempted from
the operational capacity check.
Exclusion
Applicants that are subject to EU administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion)32 or are in one of
the following exclusion situations33 that bar them from receiving EU grants can NOT
participate:
32 See Article 136 EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.

procedures for persons with unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts);
− they are in breach of social security or tax obligations (including if done by persons
with unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts);
− they are guilty of grave professional misconduct (including if done by persons having
powers of representation, decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons
who are essential for the award/implementation of the grant);
− they are guilty of fraud, corruption, having links to a criminal organisation, money

Scores and weighting
Evaluation scores will be awarded for the criteria, and not for the different aspects listed in the
table. For full applications, each criterion will be scored out of 5. The threshold for individual
criteria will be 3. The overall threshold, applying to the sum of the three individual scores,
will be 10.
To determine the ranking for ‘Innovation actions’, the score for ‘Impact’ will be given a
weight of 1.5.
Proposals that pass the individual threshold AND the overall threshold will be considered for
funding, within the limits of the available call budget. Other proposals will be rejected.
Two-stage calls
For the evaluation of first-stage applications under a two-stage submission procedure, only the
‘Excellence’ and ‘Impact’ criteria will be evaluated. Within these criteria, only the aspects in
bold will be considered.
The threshold for both individual criteria will be 4. For each indicative budget-split in the call
conditions, the overall threshold applying to the sum of the two individual scores will be set at
a level that ensures the total requested budget of proposals admitted to stage 2 is as close as
possible to three times the available budget, and not less than two and a half times the
available budget. The actual level will therefore depend on the volume of proposals received.
The threshold is expected normally to be set at 8 or 8.5.
The evaluation procedure is explained further in Annex F below.
Page 26 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
E — Documents
Submission
All proposals must be submitted electronically via the Funders & Tenders Portal electronic
submission system (accessible via the topic page in the Search Funding & Tenders section).
Paper submissions are NOT possible.
Proposals must be complete and contain all parts and mandatory annexes and supporting
documents.
The application form will have two parts:
– Part A (to be filled in directly online) contains administrative information about the
applicant organisations (future coordinator and beneficiaries and affiliated entities),
the summarised budget for the proposal and call-specific questions;
– Part B (to be downloaded from the Portal submission system, completed and then
assembled and re-uploaded as a PDF in the system) contains the technical description
of the project.
Annexes and supporting documents will be directly available in the submission system and
must be uploaded as PDF files (or other formats allowed by the system).
Proposals should be designed to stay as close as possible to the award criteria (see Annex D
above). The application form will help to achieve this.
When submitting the proposal, the coordinator will have to confirm that they have the
mandate to act for all applicants. Moreover, they will have to confirm that the information in
the application is correct and complete and that all participants comply with the conditions for
receiving EU funding (especially eligibility, financial and operational capacity, exclusion,
etc.). Proposals not complying with these requirements will be rejected. Before signing the
grant, each participant will have to confirm this again by signing a declaration of honour.
For lump sum grants proposals, the estimated budget must be described in a detailed budget
table. This will be used as a basis for justifying and/or fixing the lump sum amount. As the
lump sum must be an approximation of the costs actually incurred, the costs included in this
detailed budget table must comply with the basic eligibility conditions for EU actual cost
grants (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, Article 6). This is particularly important for
purchases and subcontracting, which must ensure best value for money (or, if appropriate, the
lowest price) and be free from any conflicts of interest. If the budget table contains ineligible
costs, the grants may be reduced (even later on during implementation of the project or after
they end). Exceptionally, the Decision authorising the use of lump sum funding for a specific
action might specify that a detailed budget table is not required.
Applicants may be asked at a later stage for further documents (for legal entity validation,
financial capacity check, bank account validation, etc.).
Page 27 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
F — Procedure
Evaluation procedure and ranking
Calls may be subject to either a single-stage submission procedure or a two-stage
submission procedure. The evaluation procedure may be organised in one (standard) or
several steps.
In the first stage of a two-stage submission, applicants will be requested to submit only an
outline application (which will be evaluated against only two award criteria: ‘Excellence’ and
‘Impact’). Successful applicants will be invited to submit a full application for the second
stage (which will be evaluated against the full set of award criteria).
Proposals will be checked for formal requirements (admissibility and eligibility) and then
evaluated (for each topic separately) by an evaluation committee composed of independent
external experts for operational capacity and award criteria (see Annexes C and D above) and
then ranked according to their quality score.
For lump sum grants proposals, comments on the detailed lump sum budget table will be
provided in the Evaluation Summary Report only for proposals invited to grant agreement
preparation (or placed in the reserve list) and ones rejected (in part) due to significant
overestimation or underestimation of costs.
Exceptionally, where indicated in the specific call/topic conditions, the evaluation committee
may be composed partially or, in the case of ‘Coordination and support actions’, partially or
fully of representatives of EU institutions.
For proposals with the same score within a single budget envelope (with the exception of the
first stage of two-stage submissions) a method to establish the priority order will be
determined, taking into consideration the objectives of the specific topic. In the absence of
special arrangements in the specific call/topic conditions, the following method will apply:
For each group of proposals with the same score, starting with the group achieving the highest
score and continuing in descending order:
1) Proposals that address aspects of the call that have not otherwise been covered by
more highly ranked proposals will be considered to have the highest priority.
2) The proposals identified under 1), if any, will themselves be prioritised according to
the scores they have been awarded for ‘Excellence’. When these scores are equal,
priority will be based on scores for ‘Impact’. In the case of ‘Innovation actions’,
priority will be given to the score for ‘Impact’, followed by that for ‘Excellence’.
3) If necessary, the gender balance among the researchers named in the researchers table
in the proposal, will be used as a factor for prioritisation.
4) If necessary, any further prioritisation will be based on geographical diversity, defined
as the number of Member States or Associated Countries represented in the proposal,
Page 28 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
not otherwise receiving funds from projects higher up the ranking list (and if equal in
number, then by budget).
5) If a distinction still cannot be made, the panel may decide to further prioritise by
considering other factors related to the objectives of the call, or to Horizon Europe in
general. These may include, for example, enhancing the quality of the project portfolio
through synergies between projects or, where relevant and feasible, involving SMEs.
These factors will be documented in the panel report.
6) The method described in 1), 2), 3) and 4) will then be applied to the remaining equally
ranked proposals in the group.
At the end of the evaluation, all applicants will be informed of the result in an evaluation
result letter. Successful proposals will be invited to the next stage, ‘grant preparation’; the
other proposals will be put on the reserve list or rejected.
No commitment to provide funding — Invitation to the grant preparation stage does NOT
constitute a formal commitment to funding. Various legal checks are still needed before the
grant can be awarded, such as legal entity validation, financial capacity verification, exclusion
check, etc.
If indicated in the specific call/topic conditions, proposals which were judged to deserve
funding but did not succeed because of budget limits will receive a Seal of Excellence37. With
prior authorisation from the applicant, the granting authority may share information
concerning the proposal and the evaluation with interested financing authorities, subject to the
conclusion of confidentiality agreements.
Budget flexibility — The budgets set out in the calls and topics are indicative. Unless
otherwise stated, final budgets may change following evaluation. The final figures may
change by up to 20% compared to the total budget indicated in each individual part of the
work programme. Changes within these limits will not be considered substantial within the
meaning of Article 110(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 2018/1046.
Joint calls for proposals — In cases of applications for joint calls with third countries
(including scientific and technological organisations or agencies from third countries),
international organisations or non-profit legal entities, the joint selection and evaluation
procedures will be indicated in the specific call/topic conditions.
Blind evaluation pilot – If indicated in the specific call/topic conditions, first-stage
proposals of two-stage submissions will be evaluated blindly38 and applicants must not
disclose their identity in Part B of their proposal (see Annex A above).
Evaluation review procedure
37 https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/seal-excellence_en.
38 See Horizon Europe Programme Guide for further details.
Page 29 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
If the consortium believes that the evaluation procedure was flawed, the coordinator can
submit a complaint (following the deadlines and procedures also set out in the evaluation
result letter).
Only the procedural aspects of an evaluation may be the subject of a request for an evaluation
review. The evaluation of the merits of a proposal will not be the subject of an evaluation
review.
A request for an evaluation review must relate to a specific proposal and must be submitted
within 30 days after the beneficiary accesses the evaluation results. The deadlines will be
counted from the date of opening/access. The maximum size limit of the request is 7 000
characters. Notifications of evaluation results which have not been opened in the Funding &
Tenders Portal within 10 days after sending are considered to have been accessed (see also
Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions).
An evaluation review committee will provide an opinion on the procedural aspects of the
evaluation. The evaluation review committee may recommend a re-evaluation of the proposal,
to be carried out primarily by evaluators who were not involved in the previous evaluation, or
a confirmation of the initial evaluation.
Indicative timetable for evaluation and for signature of the grant agreement
Unless otherwise stated in the specific call/topic conditions, the timing for evaluation and
grant preparation is as follows:
– information on the outcome of the evaluation: around 5 months from the deadline for
submission;
– indicative date for the signing of grant agreements: around 8 months from the deadline
for submission.
For two-stage calls, the timing is different (for the evaluation result: around 3 months from
the deadline for submission for the first stage, and around 5 months from the deadline for
submission for the second stage, for signature of the grant agreement around 8 months from in
the second stage deadline for submission).
Page 30 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
G — Legal and financial set-up of the grant agreements
During the grant preparation stage, the consortium will be asked to prepare the grant
agreement, together with the EU project officer.
This grant agreement will set out the framework for the grant and its terms and conditions,
particularly concerning deliverables, reporting and payments. The applicable model with the
complete text of the provisions is available on the topic page, together with the other call
documentation.
Starting date & project duration
The project starting date and duration will be fixed in the grant agreement (see Data Sheet,
point 1). Normally, the starting date will be after the grant has been signed. A starting date
before the date the grant is signed (retroactive) can be granted exceptionally for duly justified
reasons, if agreed with the granting authority39.
The project duration is provided in months (extensions will be possible only exceptionally, for
duly justified reasons and if the granting authority agrees).
Milestones and deliverables
The milestones and deliverables for each project will be managed through the grant
management system in the Portal and are reflected in Annex 1 of the grant agreement.
The standard deliverables will be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
Form of grant, funding rate and maximum grant amount
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be
fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 3 and Article 5).
The project budget is provided in EUR. The amount of the grant awarded may be lower than
the amount requested.
For actual cost grants, the grant will be a budget-based, mixed actual cost grant. This means
that it will reimburse ONLY certain types of costs (eligible costs) and ONLY those costs
actually incurred for the project (NOT the budgeted costs).
The costs will be reimbursed at the funding rate fixed in the specific call/topic conditions and
in the grant agreement.
Such grants may NOT produce a profit. If there is a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU grant
over costs), it will be deducted from the final grant amount.
Moreover, the final grant amount may be reduced in case of non-compliance (e.g. improper
implementation, breach of obligations, etc.).
39 See Article 193 EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
Page 31 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
The maximum Horizon Europe funding rates are as follows:
– Research and innovation action: 100%
– Innovation action: 70% (except for non-profit legal entities, where a rate of up to
100% applies)
– Coordination and support action: 100%
– Programme co-fund action: between 30% and 70%
– Innovation and market deployment: 70% (except for non-profit legal entities, where a
rate of up to 100% applies)
– Training and mobility action: 100%
– Pre-commercial procurement action: 100%
– Public procurement of innovative solutions action: 50%
Other funding rates may be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
For lump sum and unit grants, the funding rate is already applied as part of the
methodology for fixing the amounts and is therefore not shown in the grant agreement.
Budget categories and cost eligibility rules
The budget categories and cost eligibility rules are fixed in the grant agreement (see Data
Sheet, point 3 and Article 6).
Budget categories:
– actual costs (i.e. costs which are real and not estimated or budgeted) for:
– personnel costs (unless declared as a unit cost; see below);
– subcontracting costs;
– purchase costs (unless declared as a unit cost; see below); and
– costs of providing financial support to third parties (if provided for in the
specific call conditions);
– units (i.e. an amount per unit) for:
– personnel costs of SME owners/natural persons not receiving a salary;
– personnel costs calculated by the beneficiaries according to their usual cost
accounting practices (average personnel costs);
– costs of internally invoiced goods and services calculated by the beneficiaries
according to their usual cost accounting practices; and
Page 32 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
– specific unit costs (if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions; see also
Annex 2a of the grant agreement);
– flat-rate (i.e. costs calculated by applying a percentage fixed in advance to other types
of eligible costs) for:
– indirect costs (25% flat-rate of the total eligible direct costs, excluding eligible
direct costs for subcontracting, financial support to third parties and any unit
costs or lump sums which include indirect costs);
– lump sum (i.e. a global amount deemed to cover all costs of the action or a specific
category of costs, if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions).
Within a grant, different forms of costs can be used.
Costs can also be declared under several EU Synergy grants, if the cumulative funding under
the grants does not exceed 100% of the eligible costs and the contributions declared to them.
Reporting & payment arrangements
The reporting and payment arrangements are fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 4
and articles 21 and 22).
After the grant has been signed, the consortium will normally receive a float to start working
on the project (normally, pre-financing of 160% of the average EU funding per reporting
period (i.e. maximum grant amount/number of periods); exceptionally, less or no pre-
financing). For actions with only one reporting period, it will be less, since 100% would mean
the totality of the grant amount.
Programme co-fund actions may receive additional pre-financing payments.
Payments will be automatically lowered if one of the consortium members has outstanding
debts towards the EU (granting authority or other EU bodies). Such debts will be offset by the
granting authority, in line with the conditions set out in the grant agreement (see Article 22).
At the moment of the prefinancing payment, an amount ranging from 5% to 8% of the
maximum grant amount will be deducted from the prefinancing payment and transferred to
the mutual insurance mechanism. This mechanism covers the risks associated with non-
recovery of sums due from the beneficiaries.
There will be one or several interim payments linked to a periodic report, depending on the
duration of the project.
At the end of the project, the consortium will be invited to submit a report on the basis of
which the final grant amount will be calculated. If the total of earlier payments is higher than
the final grant amount, the beneficiaries concerned (or the coordinator) will be asked to pay
back the difference (recovery).
Certificates
Page 33 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Depending on the size of the grant amount and on the type of beneficiaries, beneficiaries may
be required to submit a certificate on the financial statements. The thresholds for this
certificate are fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 4 and Article 24).
Liability regime for recoveries
The liability regime for recoveries is that of individual financial responsibility. Each
beneficiary is liable only for their own debt (and those of its affiliated entities, if any) (Data
Sheet point 4.4 and Article 22).
Provisions concerning project implementation
– Proper implementation of the action (Article 11).
– Conflict of interest (Article 12).
– Confidentiality and security (EU classified information) (Article 13 and Annex 5).
– Ethics (research integrity) and values (gender mainstreaming) (Article 14 and Annex
5).
– Data protection (Article 15).
– Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), background and results, access rights and rights of
use (Article 16 and Annex 5). In addition to the standard provisions, the following
specific provisions in the model grant agreement will apply to all grants awarded
under this work programme:
Additional exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency: If
requested by the granting authority, beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive
licences to their results – for a limited period of time specified in the request
and on fair and reasonable conditions – to legal entities that need the results to
address the public emergency. These legal entities must commit to rapidly and
broadly exploiting the resulting products and services on fair and reasonable
conditions. This provision will apply up to 4 years after the end of the action.
Additional information obligation relating to standards: Unless stated
otherwise in the specific call conditions, beneficiaries must, up to 4 years after
the end of the action, inform the granting authority if the results could
reasonably be expected to contribute to European or international standards.
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing — Horizon
Europe actions: The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the
action, object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results,
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5.
– Communication, dissemination, open science and visibility (Article 17 and Annex 5).
In addition to the standard provisions, the following specific provisions in the model
grant agreement will apply to all grants awarded under this work programme:
Page 34 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Open science - additional practices, validation of scientific publications:
Beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access to data or other results
needed to validate the conclusions of scientific publications, to the extent that
their legitimate interests or constraints are safeguarded (and unless they
already provided the (open) access at publication).
Open science - additional practices, public emergency: In case of a public
emergency, if requested by the granting authority, beneficiaries must
immediately deposit any research output in a repository and provide open
access to it under a CC BY licence, a public domain dedication (CC 0) or
equivalent.
As an exception, if providing open access would be against the beneficiaries’
legitimate interests, the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences, on fair
and reasonable conditions, to legal entities that need the research output to
address the public emergency. These legal entities must commit to rapidly and
broadly exploiting the resulting products and services on fair and reasonable
conditions. This exception is limited to 4 years after the end of the action.
– Specific rules for carrying out the action (Article 18 and Annex 5).
Other provisions may be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
Non-compliance and breach of contract
The grant agreement (Chapter 5) provides for the measures that may be taken in case of
breach of contract (and other violations of law).
For more information, see the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
Page 35 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
IMPORTANT
• Do not wait until the end — Complete the application sufficiently in advance of the deadline to avoid any
last minute technical problems. Problems due to last-minute submissions (e.g. congestion, etc.) will be
entirely at applicants’ own risk. Call deadlines can NOT be extended at the request of applicants.
• Consult the topic page on the Portal regularly. The granting authority will use it to publish updates and
additional information on the call (call updates).
• Funding & Tenders Portal electronic exchange system — By submitting the application, all applicants
accept to use the electronic exchange system in accordance with the Portal Terms & Conditions.
• Registration — Before submitting the application, all beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated partners
must be registered in the Participant Register. The participant identification code (PIC) (one per participant)
is mandatory for the application form. For validation, beneficiaries and affiliated entities will be requested to
upload the necessary documents showing their legal status and origin during the grant preparation stage.
Associated partners do not need validation.
• Consortium roles — When setting up the consortium, applicants should think of organisations that can help
them reach objectives and solve problems.
The roles should be attributed according to the degree of participation of each participant in the project. Main
participants should participate as beneficiaries or affiliated entities; other entities may participate as
associated partners, subcontractors, or third parties giving in-kind contributions, provided that the related
conditions are fulfilled. Associated partners and third parties giving in-kind contributions should bear their
own costs (they will not become formal recipients of EU funding). Subcontracting should normally constitute
a limited part and must be performed by third parties (not by one of the beneficiaries/affiliated entities, see
section G).
• Coordinator — In multi-beneficiary grants, the beneficiaries participate as a consortium (group of
beneficiaries). They will have to choose a coordinator among them, who will manage and coordinate the
project and will represent the consortium towards the granting authority. In mono-beneficiary grants, the
single beneficiary will automatically be the coordinator.
• Affiliated entities — Applicants may participate with affiliated entities. Affiliated entities will get a part of
the EU funding and must therefore comply with all the call conditions (just like beneficiaries). But they do
not sign the grant agreement and do not count towards the minimum eligibility criteria for consortium
composition (if any).
• Associated partners — Applicants may participate with associated partners. They participate without
funding and without signing the grant agreement and therefore do not need to be validated.
• Consortium agreement — For practical and legal reasons, participants must conclude a written consortium
agreement to ensure the smooth and successful implementation of the action and to deal with exceptional or
unforeseen circumstances, unless otherwise provided for in the specific call conditions. The consortium
agreement also gives the possibility to redistribute the EU funding according to internal consortium
principles and arrangements (for instance, one beneficiary can reattribute their grant share to another
beneficiary). The consortium agreement thus allows the grant to be customised to the needs of the consortium
and can also help to protect the members in case of disputes. Consortium agreements are not required for
mono-beneficiary projects.
• Completed/ongoing projects — Applications for projects that have already been completed will be rejected.
Applications for projects that have already started will be assessed on a case-by-case basis (in such cases, no
costs can normally be reimbursed for activities that took place before the application was submitted).
Page 36 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
• No-profit rule — Grants may NOT give a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU grant over costs). This will
be checked by the granting authority at the end of the project.
• No double funding — There is strict prohibition of double funding from the EU budget. Any given action
may receive only ONE grant from the EU budget (except for EU Synergy grants) and same costs may
under NO circumstances be declared to two different EU actions.
• Combination with EU operating grants — Combination with EU operating grants is possible, if the
project remains outside the operating grant work programme and the beneficiary makes sure that cost items
are clearly separated in its accounting and NOT declared twice (see AGA — Annotated Model Grant
Agreement, Article 6.2.E).
• Multiple applications — Applicants may submit more than one application for different projects under the
same call (and be awarded funding for them).
Organisations may participate in several applications.
BUT: if there are several applications for the same/very similar project, only one application will be
accepted and evaluated.
• Language — Applicants can submit their application in any official EU language. However, for reasons of
efficiency, it is strongly advised to use English. If applicants need the call documentation in another
official EU language, they must submit a request within 10 days after publication of the call (for the
contact information, see topic page).
• Rejection — By submitting the application, all applicants accept the general call conditions set out in the
General Annexes and the specific call conditions set out in the topics. Applications that do not comply with
all the call conditions will be rejected. This applies also to applicants: all applicants need to fulfil the
criteria; if any one of them does not, they must be replaced or the entire application will be rejected.
• Cancellation — There may be circumstances which may require the cancellation of the call. In this case,
applicants will be informed via a call update. Cancellations are without entitlement to compensation.
• Transparency — In accordance with Article 38 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046, information
about EU grants awarded is published each year on the Europa website.
This includes:
• beneficiaries’ names;
• beneficiaries’ addresses;
• the purpose for which the grant was awarded;
• the maximum amount awarded.
Publication can exceptionally be waived (following a reasoned and duly substantiated request), if there is a
risk that disclosure could jeopardise applicants’ rights and freedoms under the EU Charter of Fundamental
Rights or harm its commercial interests.
• Data protection — The submission of an application under this call involves the collection, use and
processing of personal data. This data will be processed in accordance with Regulation 2018/1725. It will
be processed solely for the purpose of evaluating the application (and subsequent management of the grant
and, if needed, programme monitoring, evaluation and communication). Details are explained in the
Funding & Tenders Portal privacy statement.

General Annexes
SPECIFIC CONDITIONS FOR ACTIONS WITH PCP/PPI
H — Specific conditions for actions implementing pre-commercial procurement or
procurement of innovative solutions
This Annex applies to all types of actions implementing pre-commercial procurement (PCP)
and procurement of innovative solutions (PPI). It applies to both PCP/PPI actions and other
types of actions which prepare and/or execute a PCP or PPI, for instance through
subcontracting activities.
Requirements for all types of actions supporting PCP or PPI
The PCP/PPI must be prepared and executed by one of the following:
- by one or more public procurer(s), plus possibly one or more private and/or NGO
procurer(s) that provide similar services of public interest, that is (are) responsible for
the acquisition and/or regulatory strategy of the relevant innovative solutions and aim
to obtain ambitious quality and efficiency improvements in the area of the PCP/PPI; or
- by entities with a mandate from one or more of these procurers to act on their behalf in
the procurement (e.g. central purchasing bodies).
Other entities (e.g. end-users) that do not have a conflict of interest with the PCP/PPI, and
whose participation in the action is well justified, may participate in ‘additional activities’ to
prepare, manage and follow-up the PCP/PPI and embed it into a wider set of demand-side
activities. This includes disseminating results, removing obstacles to introducing the solutions
onto the market (e.g. contributing to standardisation, regulation and certification), awareness
raising, experience sharing/training, and preparing further cooperation among stakeholders
and procurers for future PCP or PPI.
For PCP executed by a group of procurers, the buyers’ group must jointly prepare and
implement the pre-commercial procurement so that there is one joint call for tender, one joint
evaluation of offers, and a lead procurer40 awarding the research and development (R&D)
service contracts in the name and on behalf of the buyers’ group. The PCP must address one
concrete procurement need identified as a common challenge41, which requires new R&D and
is described in the common specifications of the joint PCP call for tender. Each procurer in
the buyers’ group must contribute financially to the total budget necessary to jointly finance
the PCP, enabling the procurers to share the costs of procuring R&D services from a number
of providers and comparing the merits of the alternative solutions pursued by these competing
providers to address the common challenge.
40 The ‘lead procurer’ is a public procurer and is the beneficiary appointed by the buyers’ group to coordinate
and lead the procurement activities. They can be either one of the procurers in the buyers’ group or another
beneficiary in the action who is established or designated by the procurers in the buyers’ group to act as lead
procurer.
41 Addressing the common challenge in different countries may require, beyond the common core functionality,
the development and testing of additional local functionality or adaption of solutions by each procurer due to
differences in the local context. A PCP that addresses a challenge consisting of several facets (sub-challenges or
building blocks) is considered one joint PCP, as long as all procurers in the buyers’ group share the need for -
and are willing to co-finance - all the facets of the common challenge.
Page 38 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
For PPI executed by a group of procurers, the lead procurer must coordinate the preparation
and implementation of one joint or several coordinated public procurements of innovative
solutions, based on common specifications defined jointly by the buyers’ group. Each PPI
must focus on one concrete need identified as a common challenge that requires the
deployment of innovative solutions42.
Projects that aim to implement a PCP/PPI must contain a preparation and execution stage.
Preparation stage
The expected outcomes for the preparation stage, to be included as deliverables/milestones,
are:
- a prior information notice for the open market consultation: 5 days before submission
for publication to the OJEU, i.e. a minimum of 50 days before the start of the first
meeting;
- a report on the result of the open market consultation, prior market analysis and its
impact on the tender documents; in addition, for PPI, feedback from activities to verify
market readiness before deployment (e.g. conformance testing, certification, quality
labelling);
- completed tender documents based on the Horizon Europe PCP/PPI model contract
documents, including the contract notice: 30 days before its submission to the OJEU;
- for PCP/PPI executed by a group of procurers: the signed joint procurement agreement
confirming the final means of cooperation, including the financial commitment of the
buyers’ group for the PCP/PPI, and final confirmation of the lead procurer.
Execution stage
The expected outcome of the execution stage is the implementation of the procurement
procedure and of the PCP/PPI contracts. For PCP, this includes validating and comparing the
performance of the competing PCP solutions to verify if they can be converted into permanent
service. For PPI, this includes deploying the innovative solutions and evaluating the results in
real-life operating conditions, with a duration that allows for appropriate evaluation of the
potential impact of these solutions if converted into permanent service.
Deliverables/milestones to be included in the description of work for the execution stage are:
– a copy of the contract award notice published in TED: 48 days after the award of
contracts;
– at the end of the tender evaluation (for PCP, also after the evaluations of each phase):
– information on the total number of bids received, particularly the data on the
winning tenderer(s) and abstracts of the winning tenders for publication and
evaluation purposes;
42 Addressing the common challenge in different countries may require deployment and, where applicable,
conformance testing, of local functionality or adaption of solutions for each procurer due to differences in the
local context.
Page 39 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
– final ranking list of the selected projects, final scores and qualitative assessment
per criterion for each bid received, along with minutes of the evaluation meeting;
– for PCP: assessing the results achieved by each tenderer in the previous phase;
– at the end of the action, give a demonstration to the granting authority:
– for PCP: of the tested solutions resulting from the PCP;
– for PPI: of the deployed innovative solution(s).
Where the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) does not apply, participation in
tendering procedures must be open on equal terms to bidders from EU Member States and all
countries with which the EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement under the
conditions laid down in that agreement, including all Horizon Europe Associated Countries.
Where the WTO GPA applies, tendering procedures must also be open to bidders from states
that have ratified this agreement, under the conditions laid down therein.
If the specific call conditions restrict participation or control for security reasons, participation
in the PCP/PPI procedure must also be limited to bidders meeting this restriction. If the
specific conditions for the topic impose a place of performance obligation, the place of
performance of the contract must comply with this obligation.
Specific requirements for pre-commercial procurement (PCP)
The following requirements apply to ensure that the provisions for PCP in the Horizon Europe
rules for participation, the conditions for the R&D services exemption of the EU Directives on
public procurement43, the EU Treaty principles44 and the competition rules45 are fully
respected.
Definitions
PCP must comply with the Horizon Europe definition: ‘Pre-commercial procurement’ means
procurement of R&D services involving risk-benefit sharing under market conditions and
competitive development in phases, where there is a clear separation between the procurement
of the R&D services procured from the deployment of commercial volumes of end-products46.
‘Risk-benefit sharing under market conditions’ refers to the PCP approach in which procurers
share with suppliers at market price the risks and benefits related to the intellectual property
rights (IPR) resulting from the R&D.
43 See Article 14 of Directive 2014/24/EU, Article 32 of Directive 2014/25/EU and Article 13(f)(j) of Directive
2009/81/EC.
44 In particular, the fundamental Treaty principles on the free movement of goods and workers, the freedom to
provide services, the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital, as well as the principles
deriving therefrom, such as the principles of non-discrimination, transparency and equal treatment.
45 See, in particular, Article 2.3 of the 2014 R&D&I State aid framework.
46 See the Horizon Europe Regulation and the PCP Communication COM/2007/799 and associated
SEC(1668)2007. Note that PCPs can include the purchase of the first end-products that were developed, installed
and tested during the PCP, but not the purchase of larger commercial volumes of end-products requiring quantity
production beyond delivering the first products for the PCP.
Page 40 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
‘Competitive development in phases’ refers to buying the R&D from several competing R&D
providers in parallel and to comparing and identifying the best-value-for-money solutions on
the market to address the PCP challenge. To reduce the investment risk for the procurer,
reward the most competitive solutions and facilitate the participation of smaller innovative
companies, the R&D is also split into phases (solution design, prototyping, original
development and validation/testing of the first products), with the number of competing R&D
providers being reduced after each phase.
‘Separation from the deployment of commercial volumes of end-products’ refers to the
complementarity of PCP, which focuses on the R&D phase before wide commercialisation,
and PPI, which does not focus on R&D but on wide commercialisation/diffusion of solutions.
Procurers can, but are not obliged, to procure R&D results from a PCP.
Preparation and publication of the open market consultation and call for tender
To prepare the call for tender, an open market consultation47 with potential tenderers and end-
users must be held to broach the views of the market on the intended scope of the R&D. The
results of this open market consultation must be taken into account to fine-tune the tender
specifications, so that the gap between state-of-the-art industry development and the
procurement needs justifies the procuring of R&D48 services.
The PCP contract notice must be published EU-wide49 in at least English. Offers must be
accepted and communication with stakeholders must be enabled at all stages in at least
English. All offers must be evaluated according to the same objective criteria, regardless of
the geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of the tenderers.
The prior information notice for the open market consultation and the contract notice must be
advertised widely, using in particular Horizon Europe internet sites and national contact
points. The Commission must be informed at least 5 days before the expected date of
publication of the prior information notice for the open market consultation and 30 days
before the expected date of publication of the PCP contract notice. The PCP call for tenders
must remain open for at least 60 days.
Tender documentation, procurement and implementation of the contract
47 The open market consultation should be organised in a way not to preclude or distort competition. In respect
of the Treaty principles, the open market consultation must be announced well in advance and widely - via a
prior information notice that is published at least 45 days before the first open market consultation meeting in the
Official Journal of the EU - and enable potential tenderers regardless of their geographic location to participate at
least in English. All information given in answers to questions from participants in the dialogue should be
documented and published.
48 In line with WTO GPA 2014 Article XIII(1)(f), R&D can cover activities such as solution exploration and
design, prototyping, up to the original development of a limited volume of first products or services in the form
of a test series. Original development of a first product or service may include limited production or supply to
incorporate the results of field testing and demonstrate that the product or service is suitable for production or
supply in quantity to acceptable quality standards. R&D does not include quantity production or supply to
establish commercial viability or to recover R&D costs, nor commercial development activities such as
incremental adaptations or routine or periodic changes to existing products, services, production lines, processes
or other operations in progress, even if such changes may represent improvements.

General Annexes
The PCP contract that will be concluded with each selected tenderer must take the form of
one single framework agreement covering all PCP phases, without contract renegotiations
after the award. This framework agreement must contain information on the procedures for
implementing the different phases (through specific contracts), including the format of the
intermediate evaluations (including evaluation criteria and weightings) for each phase.
For PCP executed by a group of procurers, the R&D service contracts are awarded by the lead
procurer and all selected tenderers can be paid by the lead procurer, or pro rata by each
procurer in the buyers’ group according to their share in the total PCP budget.
The PCP contract notice must contain information on the intended number of R&D providers
that will be selected (minimum of three providers) to start the PCP, the number of PCP phases
and the expected duration and budget for each PCP phase. The PCP must cover the full PCP
life cycle of solution design, prototyping, and original development, including installation and
testing of a limited volume of test series products/services in the procurer’s/end-user’s
premises. Each of the three PCP phases can be split up into further phases if appropriate.
The following simplified and/or accelerated PCP procedures may be used: for PCP that
require fast deployment50, one specific contract may cover both the second and third PCP
phase; if fewer than two tenderers are capable of performing the R&D services in the EU
Member States or Associated Countries (for security contracts, this may be restricted to the
Member States), the phase 1 contracts may be awarded to a minimum of two tenderers.
Procurers must avoid the use of selection criteria based on disproportionate qualification and
financial guarantee requirements (e.g. with regard to prior customer references and minimum
turnover). Functional/performance-based specifications must be used to formulate the object
of the PCP call for tender as a problem to be solved, without prescribing a specific approach
to be followed. Evaluation of the tenders must be based on best-value-for-money criteria, not
just lowest price.
The PCP process must be organised to avoid any conflicts of interest, including in the use of
external experts. Providers cannot be beneficiaries in an action during which the PCP is
planned or undertaken.
The PCP process must require selected providers to locate the majority of the R&D activities,
including the principal researcher(s) working for the PCP contract in particular, in the
Member States or Associated Countries51.
The PCP procurers must not reserve the R&D results exclusively for their own use. The
providers generating results must own the attached IPR, and the procurers must enjoy at least
royalty-free access rights to use the R&D results for their own use. The procurers must also
enjoy the right to grant (or to require the granting of) non-exclusive licences to third parties,
to exploit the results under fair and reasonable market conditions, without any right to
50 Especially where a budgetary commitment for deployment is already available at the start of the PCP (fast-
track PCP).
51 For duly justified reasons of public security, this may be limited to the EU Member States.

General Annexes
sublicense. A call-back provision must ensure that, in case the providers fail to commercially
exploit the results within a given period after the PCP, or use the results to the detriment of
the public interest, including security interests, the procurers can require transfer of the
ownership of the results.
The procurers must inform tenderers of the right to publish public summaries of the results of
the PCP project, including information about key R&D results attained and lessons learnt (e.g.
on the feasibility of the solution approaches to meet the requirements and lessons learnt for
potential future deployment of solutions). Details that would be contrary to the public interest,
would harm legitimate business interests (e.g. regarding IPR-protected specificities of their
individual approaches to solutions) or could distort fair competition may not be disclosed.
To enable the procurers to establish the correct (best value for money) market price for the
R&D service, in which case the presence of State aid can in principle be excluded, the PCP
call for tender must be carried out in a competitive and transparent way in line with Treaty
principles. In addition, the distribution of rights and obligations between procurers and
providers (including the allocation of IPR) must be published in the PCP call for tender
documents, to obtain a price according to market conditions (and rule out State aid). PCP
contracts with providers must contain financial compensation according to market
conditions52, compared to the exclusive development price, for assigning IPR to the providers.
Specific requirements for public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI)
Definition
PPI must comply with the relevant Horizon Europe definitions.
‘Public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI)’ means procurement where contracting
authorities act as a launch customer for innovative goods or services which are not yet
available on a large-scale commercial basis, and may include conformity testing.
‘Launch customers’, also called early adopters, refer to the first 20% of customers on the
EU’s internal market that buy innovative solutions. The solutions have to be new to the
procurers in the project, the procurers’ market segment or new to the EU’s internal market,
and relevant to procurers in other Member States and/or Associated Countries.
‘Innovative solutions’ are new or significantly improved products, services or processes that
have already been (partially) demonstrated on a small scale, and may be nearly or already
available in small quantities on the market, but which have not been widely adopted yet.
Typically, owing to the residual risk of market uncertainty, they have not been produced at a
large enough scale to meet mass market price/quality requirements. This also includes
existing solutions that are to be utilised in a new and innovative way; PPI does not include the
procurement of R&D.
52 The market price should reflect the benefits allocated to the R&D provider (e.g. commercialisation
opportunities opened up by the IPR) and the risks assumed by the R&D provider (e.g. the cost of maintaining the
IPR and commercialising the products).

General Annexes
Preparation and publication of the open market consultation and call for tender
Unless the PPI is undertaken as a follow-up to an FP7, Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe
PCP53, or unless the situation is a low-value PPI below national procurement thresholds, the
following obligations apply:
– To prepare the call for tenders, an open market consultation with potential tenderers
and end-users must be held to inform the market well in advance of the upcoming PPI
and broach the views of the market on the PPI’s intended scope. Information retrieved
from this consultation about the gap between perceived procurement needs and on-
going industry developments must be taken into account in the PPI tender
specifications, so that the PPI duly focuses on ‘early adoption’ of ‘innovative’
solutions.
– The market must be informed well in advance54 of the target date for publishing the
PPI call for tenders. Market readiness prior to deployment can be verified through the
organisation of e.g. conformity testing, certification or quality labelling of solutions.
– The PPI contract notices must be published EU-wide in at least English, offers must be
accepted and communication with stakeholders must be enabled at all stages in at least
English. All offers must be evaluated according to the same objective criteria,
regardless of the geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of
the tenderers.
– The prior information notices for the open market consultation, early announcements
of the expected publication date of the PPI call for tender, and the PPI contract notice
must be promoted and advertised widely, using Horizon Europe internet sites and
national contact points in particular. The Commission must be informed at least 5 days
before the expected date of publication of the PIN for the open market consultation
and 30 days before the expected date of publication of the PPI contract notice. The PPI
call for tenders must remain open for at least 60 days.
Tender documentation, procurement and implementation of the contract
Procurement procedures covered by the EU public procurement directives that do not involve
procurement of R&D can be used. Restricted procedures with shortened timeframes for the
submission of offers for reasons of urgency must not be used. Framework
contracts/agreements with lots can be used.
For PPI implemented by a group of procurers, the specific contracts for procuring specific
quantities of goods/services for each procurer can be awarded and the selected tenderers can
53 In the case of a PPI following a PCP that was implemented according to the conditions described in Annex I,
the negotiated procedure without publication foreseen in the EU public procurement directives can then be used
(Article 32(3)(a) of Directive 2014/24/EU, Article 50(b) of Directive 2014/25/EU and Article 13(j) of Directive
2009/81/EC). At least three offers must be requested, including from the R&D providers that successfully
completed the preceding PCP.

General Annexes
either all be paid by the lead procurer, or by each procurer in the buyers’ group individually,
for their quantity of goods/services procured.
Procurers must avoid the use of selection criteria based on disproportionate qualification and
financial guarantee requirements (e.g. with regard to prior customer references and minimum
turnover). Functional/performance-based specifications must be used to formulate the object
of the PPI call for tenders as a problem to be solved, without prescribing a specific approach
to be followed. Evaluation of the tenders must be based on best-value-for-money criteria, not
just lowest price.
Procurers must organise their procurement to avoid any conflicts of interest, including in the
use of external experts. Potential providers cannot be beneficiaries in an action during which
the PPI is planned or undertaken.
To encourage fair and wide exploitation of results, ownership of IPR rights should be
assigned to the party generating the IPR, except in duly justified cases (e.g. when that party is
not able to exploit them).
The PPI call for tender must be carried out in a competitive and transparent way in line with
Treaty principles. The distribution of rights and obligations between procurers and providers
(including the allocation of IPR) must be published in the PPI call for tender documents, to
obtain a price according to market conditions (and rule out State aid).
