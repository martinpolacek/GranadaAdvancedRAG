21 FABRIX Overview
The aim of the FABRIX project is to promote sustainable urban manufacturing through
an integrated approach that includes spatial design, industrial symbiosis1, circular
manufacturing and value chain management. FABRIX will develop an innovative platform that
combines services in a suite of digital tools that enhance local stakeholders’ capacity to
manage and improve value chains (see “platform”).
The project takes two very different cities as case studies: Rotterdam in the Netherlands and
Athens in Greece; it works with representatives of the many aspects that make up the textile
and clothing industry, from student designers to established textile producers and everyone in
between.
By promoting circular business models, supporting the development of sustainable materials,
and advocating for ethical practices, we aim to catalyse a comprehensive transformation of
the Textile & Clothing (T&C) sector in Athens and Rotterdam. The tools and methods will later
be made available to other cities and industries to use and adapt to their context.
What is a FSTP?
A Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP) is a mechanism that allows beneficiaries (or
affiliated entities) to distribute public funding to (one or more) beneficiaries that are not party
to the EU Grant Agreement (third parties) for the adoption or development of digital
innovation.
FABRIX FSTP
FABRIX supports organisations within the manufacturing and social sectors through two
calls in the two selected cities, Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Athens (Greece), with a total
fund of 200,000€. Financial and learning support is provided to develop participatory
activities and best practices performed with the use of the innovative platform as
necessary for reaching the circular, regenerative and cooperation objectives of the
proposal’s model for industrial symbiosis, linking to the concepts/initiatives under the
umbrella of the New European Bauhaus.
The two calls are divided as such:
• First Call: T&C Industry Facilitators in Athens & Rotterdam / 2 facilitators in each city
for a total of €100,000
• Second call: T&C SMEs in Athens & Rotterdam / 10 SMEs in each city for a total of
€100,000
These activities are designed to ensure the development of a socially grounded production
system that increases the effectiveness of the digital solutions and enables continuation
after the end of the project. FABRIX thus supports a funding path where the calls become a
driver to expand and empower the first leading actors of these symbiotic systems. Each call
will be published on the FABRIX website and promoted through all social media channels
linked to FABRIX, the Consortium’s partners, and their related networks, to reach a high
number of relevant candidates.
1 The term describes how a network of diverse organisations can foster eco-innovation and long-term culture
change and create and share mutually profitable transactions—and improve business and technical processes.
32 First Call
The first FABRIX call seeks applications from public or private organisations, selected for
their ability to engage local stakeholders with and within the platform and to manage the
creation of local circular production systems. These are defined as “facilitators”, and may be
universities, innovation labs, associations, SMEs with ecosystems, etc2.
Each selected facilitator thus contributes to the development of a system in which the human
dimension is at the heart of technology development, leading to a more resilient, inclusive and
democratic environment.
By submitting an application to the FABRIX First Call, you compete for the following:
● Financial support of 25.000€ for your activities as Facilitator.
● Contact with and support of local experts from the FABRIX project for your activities.
● Opportunity to contribute to the development of the platform to best serve your needs
and to become one of its first users.
● Opportunity to further your goals, projects, collaboration and facilitation skills.
● Access to resources with useful learning materials and platform guides.
The FABRIX First Call opens on 5th December 2024 and closes 4th February 2025 at
midnight CET.
Expectations and Time Plan
As a facilitator, in this call’s proposal, you will be expected to suggest activities with the
end goal of promoting the emergence of a local, circular ecosystem in one of the two selected
cities and the use of the platform as the main tool to do that. In the application form, we ask
you to develop your proposal for how you will reach these goals.
Your actions should be measurable with the following minimum objectives: hold a minimum of
2 physical events; involve at least 30 stakeholders. Of SMEs involved, assist at least 10 SMEs
to sign up to the platform and assist at least two of them to sign up for the Second Call.
Peak activities are concentrated in two moments, with an extensive break in between,
divided approximately as such (timing may vary as it relates to project progress):
• April/May 2025: participate in platform user testing and co-creation event / meeting;
help disseminate FSTP Second Call for SME’s
• October 2025 - March 2026 circa: Create or assist in the organization of, and attend,
a number of local events with stakeholders and SMEs
• Oct/Nov 2026: Attend Final conference
