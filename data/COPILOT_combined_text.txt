2.5 Data protection
To process and evaluate applications, the COPILOT consortium will need to collect personal and data.

generally, to ensure compliance with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), and that personal data is collected, processed, and stored in a secure manner.
The COPILOT website system design and operational procedures ensure that data is managed in
compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR). Each applicant will
accept the COPILOT terms to ensure compliance. Please refer to https://copilot-project.eu/ to review
the platform’s privacy policy and data security policy.
Apart from the COPILOT website, data will also be stored on the project repository.
Please note that the COPILOT consortium must retain generated data until five years after the balance
of the COPILOT project is paid or longer if there are ongoing procedures (such as audits, investigations
or litigation). In this case, the data must be kept until the end.
2.6 Origin of the funds
Selected applicants will sign a dedicated sub-grant funding agreement with the COPILOT consortium.
The funds associated with this sub-grant agreement originate from the European project COPILOT and
remain the property of the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (granting authority) until the

partners through the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking GA no. 101157279.

5 Open calls: submission, selection and implementation
This section aims to provide applicants with a clear overview of the submission, selection, and
implementation process.
5.1 Application reparation and submission
The following steps must be completed to successfully submit application in the COPILOT open calls:
- Get familiar with the documentation.
- Fill in all necessary information indicated as necessary in the application form available at the
COPILOT website. Each applicant needs to choose one event from the list of events that will be
provided in the application form by the COPILOT consortium.
- Submit only if you are sure that all needed information is included.

SECOND OPENING DATE: 15th September 2025 – 13th November 2025 (17.00 CET).
The COPILOT - Open Calls is a competitive funding programme. Only one application per applicant (legal
entity or natural person) can be submitted to Open Call 3. In the event of multiple submissions by an
applicant, only the last application received (timestamp of the system) will enter the evaluation process
(and regardless of the track to which an application is being submitted to). Any other submitted
applications involving the same applicant will be declared non-eligible and will not be evaluated in any
case.
5.2 Application evaluation and selection
The evaluation of applications will be conducted internally by the COPILOT consortium. To ensure
objectivity, applications will be anonymized and reviewed by COPILOT project partners, thereby
avoiding any conflicts of interest. This process guarantees transparency and efficiency. The subsequent
section outlines the detailed process of evaluation and selection.
5.2.1 Step 1: Eligibility verification
The eligibility check will be conducted by the COPILOT consortium according to the eligibility criteria
described in section 3.1.1 of this document.
This step can finish with:
● Rejection notification stating that the applicant is not eligible. No additional feedback will
be given.
● Moving application to step 2.
6Guidelines for applicants – OC3
5.2.2 Step 2: COPILOT consortium remote evaluation of application
All applicants passing the eligibility check will pass to the next evaluation step.
The COPILOT consortium will review each application during an evaluation panel based on the scores
following evaluation criteria:
● Distance: vouchers will be awarded to cover the distance that is more than 300 km away from
the location of the organisation of the applicant. The COPILOT consortium reserves the right
to determine the number of vouchers issued per opening date; the final count will depend on
the number of events in each open call.
● Geographical distribution: COPILOT consortium wants to ensure that at least 15% of under-
represented regions receive the voucher. Therefore, 15 vouchers will be reserved for
applicants from Central & Eastern European countries5.
● Motivation (score 1-5): The applicants applying to the Voucher Network Program will have to
answer a set of questions associated with the proposed activity. Their applications will be
selected following the (i) impact of the proposed activity to their organisation / technology
and (ii) their capacity to promote the outcome of their participation, creating a multiplier
effect and attracting newcomers to the platform. SMEs, start-ups and enablers from Central
and Eastern Europe will be prioritised.
Score definition regarding evaluation process varies as follows:
Score 1 – applicant doesn't demonstrate relevant motivation in relation to the proposed activity
Score 5 – applicant demonstrated high-level motivation in relation to the proposed activity
6 Final selection
At the end of the evaluation process, all applications will be ranked by the COPILOT consortium based
on their scores. All applicants will be informed about the evaluation results.
In case of complaints, please address them at copilot@f6s.com
6.1 Checks and reviews
The EC may, at any time during the implementation of the sub-project and up to five years after the
end of the sub-project, arrange for a check and review to be carried out, by external auditors, or by the
EC services themselves, including the European Anti-Fraud office (OLAF). The procedure shall be
deemed to be initiated on the date of receipt of the relevant letter sent by the EC.
There will be no financial checks, reviews, or audits to check costs, since beneficiaries have no obligation
to document the costs incurred for the action. Checks, reviews, and audits will focus on the technical
implementation of the action.

targeted information to multiple audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic and
effective manner and to highlight the financial support of the EC.
7 Sub-grant agreement preparation and implementation
Only selected applicants will be invited.
Sub-grant agreement template is available in the open call documentation kit and is not subject to

signature is one of the following:
● Simple electronic signatures (SES)
● Advanced electronic signatures (AES)
● Qualified electronic signatures (QES)
Therefore, scanned wet signatures (hand-written signatures) are not considered eligible.
The European Commission proposes a demo of DSS (Digital Signature Services), a tool that enables the
