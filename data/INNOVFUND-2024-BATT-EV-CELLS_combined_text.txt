WORK PACKAGES
a

Work packages E
This section gives a detailed description of the project activities.
Group your activities into work packages. A work package means a major sub-division of the project. For each work package, enter an objective (expected outcome) and list the activities,
milestones and deliverables that belong to it. The grouping should be logical and guided by identifiable outputs.
Please respect the following set-up:
− your project should include the following sequential work packages (mandatory):
− WP1 – Up to Financial Close
− WP2 – Between Financial Close and Entry into Operation
16Call: [insert call identifier] — [insert call name]
EU Grants: Application form (INNOVFUND): V4.0 –15.11.2024
− for all (except NZT GENERAL-SSP and PILOTS topics): WP3 – WP7 – Year [1, 2, 3, …] of Operation (annual reporting during the operation phase)
− for NZT GENERAL-SSP and PILOTS topics and BATTERIES call: WP3 – WP5 – Year [1, 2, 3] of Operation (annual reporting during the operation phase)
− you may define additional work packages by subdividing the above mandatory work packages (e.g. subdivide WP1 Activities prior to Financial Close into two separate WPs: a WP for
completion of FEED study or for exploration of the geothermal reservoir, and a WP for financial close, or by subdividing the WP2 Activities between Financial Close and Entry into
Operation into more WPs for the construction phase). Please ensure the correct progressive numbering of the work packages and that 3/5 work packages are included for the annual
reporting during the operation phase.
You can create as many work packages as needed by copying and adjusting the tables below. d
As payments of the grant will be on a lump-sum basis when work packages are completed (prior to entry into operation) and alseo based on verified greenhouse gas reductions (after entry into
operation), you must conclude each work package with a financial reporting milestone specific to that work package. The conclusion of each work package and the reaching of its related financing
t
reporting milestone will open the right to the corresponding lump-sum payment. You must ensure that the budget for each weork package including the expected allocation of the lump-sum
contribution is proportional to the activities and effort covered by that work package.
l
p
Ensure consistency with the detailed budget table/relevant cost calculator (financial information file)
m
Objectives o
c
List the specific objectives to which the work package is linked.
e
Activities and division of work (WP description) b
Provide a concise overview of the work (planned tasks). Be specific and give a short name ando number for each task. For WP1, please also provide an overview of the documents which are
typically needed before financial close (for instance signed credit facility agreements, contratcts with project stakeholders (e.g. construction, offtake, O&M), FEED study, permit documents, due
diligence reports, insurance documents, shareholder agreements and board resolutions).
t
Show who is participating in each task: Coordinator (COO), Beneficiaries (BEN), Affiliatedo Entities (AE), Associated Partners (AP), indicating in bold the task leader.
Note: n
The Coordinator remains fully responsible for the coordination tasks, even if they a re delegated to someone else. Coordinator tasks cannot be subcontracted.
,
e
Milestones and deliverables (outputs/outcomes) pl
Milestones are the main control points in the project that help to chart pmrogress.
You can have several project milestones inside a work package; buat you can have only one milestone at the end of the work package which triggers payments.
Each project should have the following minimum reporting milesxtones triggering payments:
− financial close (milestone at the end of WP1) E
− entry into operation (milestone at the end of WP2)
− annual reporting of GHG emission avoidance (milestone at the end of WP3 – WP7/WP3 – WP5 at the end of each annual reporting period during the operation phase of the project)
Means of verification is the evidence in addition to the documents submitted as deliverables which are needed to demonstrate that a milestone has been reached.
Deliverables are project outputs which are submitted to show project progress. Please refer to the main contracts and documents. Do not include minor sub-items, internal working papers,
meeting minutes, etc. For each deliverable you must indicate a due month by when you commit to upload it in the Portal. The due month for the deliverable cannot fall outside the work package
period and must be in line with the timeline provided below. Month 1 marks the start of the project and all deadlines should be related to this starting date.

5EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
IMPORTANT NOTICE
The AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement is a user guide that aims to explain to applicants and
beneficiaries the EU Model Grant Agreements for the EU funding programmes 2021-2027.
Programme specificities are reflected in this document as examples — in so far as they are accepted
as mainstream solutions that can be used by several EU programmes.
The purpose of this document is to help users understand and interpret their Grant Agreements
(GAs). By avoiding technical vocabulary, legal references and jargon, it seeks to help readers find
answers to the practical questions they may come across when setting-up or implementing their
projects.
In the same spirit, the document’s structure mirrors that of the EU Model Grant Agreements (MGAs).
It explains each MGA Article and includes examples where appropriate.
Since all EU MGAs are derived from the same basic model (EU General Model Grant Agreement), the
AGA focuses mainly on this model. Other types of grants will be gradually covered by separate
guidance, in order to be able to cover all specificities, not only the specific explanations on the
contractual text.
Our approach
1. The text of the article appears in a grey text box — to differentiate it from the annotations.
The concepts that are annotated are in bold and underlined.
The annotations to the article are immediately underneath.
Long articles are split into different parts, so the annotations can be placed below the
relevant parts.
Examples are in green.
Lists are in red.
Specific cases and exceptions are in orange.
Programme-specific cases are in purple.
New explanations (compared to the last AGA update) will be marked with: (as from V1.0;
not applicable for the draft versions)
New rules that do not apply to all signed Grant Agreements (but instead only to those signed
after a certain version, e.g. version 3.0), will be marked with: and
2. As the AGA intends to be comprehensive, it will cover all possible options envisaged in the
EU MGAs.
Many of these options may not be relevant to your grant (and will not appear in the Grant
Agreement you sign, or will be marked ‘not applicable’). The chosen options will be
summarised in the Data Sheet of your Grant Agreement.
Versioning
The AGA will be managed as a stable corporate document with versions. Older versions will be
accessible through hyperlinks in the History of Changes table.
Other information
The AGA is limited to the provisions of the EU Model Grant Agreements. For a more general
overview of how EU grants work, see the Online Manual and the programme-specific guidance
published in the Funding & Tenders Portal Reference Documents.
The Portal Reference Documents also contain a comprehensive list of all other reference documents,
for each EU programme (including legislation, work programme and templates).
Terms are explained in the Funding & Tenders Portal Glossary.

I. EU GENERAL MODEL GRANT AGREEMENT (GENERAL
MGA)
INTRODUCTION
General > EU grants regulatory framework
1. EU Regulatory framework for funding programmes — EU Financial Regulation —
EU Programme Regulations — EU grant agreements
EU grants are given through sui generis private law contractual arrangements called ‘EU
grant agreements’.
They govern the relationship between the EU granting authorities and the
beneficiaries/participants in EU grants and set out the respective rules and obligations
concerning the funding and the implementation and of the EU projects.
The grant agreements are embedded in the EU regulatory framework, i.e. EU Financial
Regulation and the sectoral regulations setting up the funding programmes (‘basic acts’ or
‘programme regulations’).
The EU Financial Regulation codifies the procedures for awarding EU funding; the sectoral
regulations contain additional, programme-specific rules on the objectives of each programme,
eligibility, selection procedures, etc.
In September 2024, the Financial Regulation 2018/1046 was recast and replaced by the
Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
The new Regulation 2024/2509 applies to all EU calls for proposals opening as from 30
September 2024.
In addition, the EU grant agreements have been updated and will be used as from mid 2025.
The update has however very limited impact (mainly cross-references to the Financial
Regulation that had to be replaced and a clarification regarding the failure to cooperate with
checks, reviews, audits and investigations as a breach of contract in Articles 28, 30, 31 and 32
of the grant agreements — which was in substance already covered by these provisions also
before the update).
The MGA and AGA have been updated to the new numbering. For your convenience, new
footnotes have been added with references to the old Financial Regulation.
General > Scope – Types of actions – Types of grant agreements?
2. Background and scope — What types of actions are funded by EU grants —
Types of grant agreements
The EU uses different types of grants in its funding programmes (‘programmes’). The EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509 distinguishes between 2 main types: action grants (AG) and
operating grants (OG)1.
In addition, there are simplified grant types which pay only lump sums (LS) or unit costs
(UN)2.
1 See Article 183(2) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23
September 2024 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union (recast) (‘EU Financial
Regulation’) (OJ L, 2024/2509, 26.9.2024) [old Financial Regulation: Article 180(2) Regulation (EU, Euratom)
2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the
general budget of the Union (‘EU Financial Regulation’) (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1).]
10EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Grants are usually given through open calls for proposals, but may sometimes also be
awarded directly without a call. They can be multi- or mono-beneficiary actions.
The General Model Grant Agreement (General MGA) is the grant agreement for EU action
grants (AG), i.e. grants that are funded based on the actual costs incurred by the
beneficiaries.
For guidance on other types of grants, see How to manage your lump sum grants.
This new General MGA has been introduced by the European Commission for the new
generation of programmes under the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027
(new for 2021-2027), in order to ensure simpler and more coherent provisions for all EU
programmes. Programme-specific provisions are grouped in Article 6 and Annex 5; the rest of
the provisions are the same for all programmes.
The new AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement reflects this new structure. Moreover, since a
wide range of programmes is now using the European Commission eGrants IT tools (EU
Funding & Tenders Portal; also called ‘Portal’), the annotations focus on grants managed
through these IT tools. For other aspects, the AGA applies to grant agreements managed
outside these tools (paper).
General > How to set up your project — Consortium composition and roles and responsibilities
3. How to set up your project — Consortium composition and roles and
responsibilities
Capacity to successfully carry out the project:
The Financial Regulation requires that beneficiaries must have the technical and financial
resources needed to carry out their projects (‘operational and financial capacity’)3.
This assessment is project-specific (and the outcome may accordingly vary between calls,
depending on the complexity and nature of the action). What will be checked is if the
participants have sufficient operational and financial capacity to carry out the proposed
action.
The sufficient capacity must be demonstrated in the proposal and be available at the moment
of the implementation of the work (i.e. not necessarily already at the moment of submitting
the proposal or signing the GA, but at least when the work starts). In order to give sufficient
assurance, proposals should show how the resources will be made available when they are
needed.
Examples (acceptable):
1. For an innovative technology call, a Start-up company with no resources at the time of proposal
submission, but with a credible business plan described in the application.
2. SME which, if it gets the grant, plans to double its capacity/staff.
Examples (not acceptable):
1. Consultancy company which submits a proposal where the majority of the work is
subcontracted.
2 See Article 183(3) and 125 Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 180(3) and 125
Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
3 See Article 201 Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 198 Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
11EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. For a call for distribution of support goods in an immediate crisis situation, a start-up with no
experience and no resources at the time of proposal submission.
Different roles in the GA:
Ideally, the project work should be done by the beneficiaries and their affiliated entities
themselves, but if needed, they may involve other partners and rely on outside resources
(purchase new equipment, goods, works or services, subcontract a part of the work or
involve associated partners, etc).
Legally speaking, it is the beneficiaries that remain fully responsible towards the granting
authority (since they are the ones that have signed the Grant Agreement (GA)). For all the other
participants, the obligations under the Grant Agreement are indirect, meaning that the
beneficiaries must ensure that the activities of the other participants are in line with the Grant
Agreement. In case of non-compliance, the granting authority will turn to the beneficiaries to
enforce their obligations.
Depending on the programme and on the type of action, entities can participate in various
roles: as coordinator, beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, in-kind
contributors, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP).
Each role is linked to a set of conditions and legal rights and obligations that are relatively rigid.
Make sure that you chose the appropriate role for everyone. Having the wrong role can cause a
lot of problems later on.
Coordinator vs other beneficiaries
The coordinator is the participant that will be the central contact point (for the granting
authority) and represent the consortium (towards the granting authority). The other
beneficiaries are the other entities that participate as beneficiaries (i.e. also sign the grant).
For mono-beneficiary grants, the mono-beneficiary also has the coordinator role.
Beneficiaries vs affiliated entities
Affiliated entities (new for 2021-2027; in some programmes previously called ‘linked third
parties’) are in practice treated largely like beneficiaries (except that — formally speaking —
they do NOT sign the Grant Agreement).
They must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding as the beneficiaries and
need to have a validated participant identification code (PIC) in the Portal Participant
Register. Annotations in this AGA which refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to affiliated
entities (just like the provisions of the MGA themselves; see also MGA Preamble).
More details on participant registration and PICs are explained in the Online Manual >
Participant Register > Registration and validation of your organisation on the Funding & Tenders
Portal.
Su bcontractors vs suppliers of goods, works and services
The core criterium for distinguishing between subcontracts and contracts/purchases is
whether they concern action tasks as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of
the Grant Agreement).
Subcontracts Purchases
Subcontracts concern the implementation Purchases concern any other contracting
12EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025

services) that are necessary for the
beneficiaries to implement the work (can
range from big equipment to petty goods)
but do not constitute by themselves an
action task described in Annex 1.
The price for the subcontracts will be The price for these contracts will be
declared as ‘Subcontracting costs’ in the declared in one of the ‘Purchase costs’
financial statement. columns in the financial statement.
Example (subcontracts): Subcontract to organise a conference that is set as part of the
tasks in Annex 1.
Example (purchases): Contract for an audit certificate on the financial statements; contract
for the translation of documents; contract for the publication of brochures; contract for the
creation of a website that enables the beneficiaries to work together (if creating the website is
just a project management tool and not a separate subcontracted ‘action task’); contract for
organisation of the rooms and catering for a meeting (if the organisation of the meeting is not
a separate subcontracted ‘action task’); contract for hiring IPR consultants/agents needed for
the project.
The same kind of items (e.g. writing materials) can qualify as purchases in one action
(simple consumables for the implementation of the action), but as subcontracting in another
(e.g. if it is an action task to acquire writing materials for a school).
Subcontractors and purchases vs affiliated entities
In contrast to subcontractors, affiliated entities have a link (e.g. legal or capital) with a
beneficiary which goes beyond the implementation of the action.
Subcontracts and purchases Affiliated entities

The eligible cost is the price charged to the The eligible costs are only the costs of the
beneficiary (usually containing a profit affiliated entity, no profit is allowed (neither
margin for the supplier or subcontractors, for the affiliated entity, nor for the
but not for the beneficiary). beneficiary).
The beneficiary must award the contracts
and subcontracts on the basis of best value
for money (or lowest price) and absence of
conflict of interests.
Example (implementation by affiliated entity): Company X and company Y do not control
each other, but they are both fully owned by company Z. Company X is beneficiary in the grant
and company Y implements some of the action tasks described in Annex 1(testing and analysis
of the resistance of a new component under high temperatures).
Contributions against payment vs in-kind contributions (for free)
13EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In some projects, third parties make available some of their resources to a beneficiary
without this being part of their normal economic activity (i.e. seconding personnel,
contributing equipment, infrastructure or other assets, or other goods and services).
This can be done against payment or for free. If against payment, the costs paid can be
charged by the beneficiaries to the action (e.g. A.3 Seconded persons, C.2 Equipment and
C.3 Other goods, works and services); if for free, there are no costs that arise for the
beneficiaries, so nothing can be charged to the action (exception for HE: in-kind contributions
for free can under certain conditions be declared as eligible costs, see Article 6.1).
Example (in-kind contributions (for free)): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university. His salary is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but by the government (the
ministry). According to the secondment agreement, the government does not ask any
reimbursement in exchange (non-cash donation). Since the beneficiary does not incur any
costs, nothing can be charged to the grant. (exception for HE: the beneficiary can declare the
salary costs in its financial statements, even if they are paid by the ministry/government).
Example (contributions against payment): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university. His salary is paid by the government (the ministry) which employs him. According
to the secondment agreement, the beneficiary (the university) has to reimburse the
government an amount corresponding to the paid salary. The reimbursed amount is a cost for
the beneficiary and is recorded as such in its accounts. The beneficiary will declare the amount
reimbursed to the government in its financial statements.
Associated partners vs affiliated entities and third parties giving in-kind contributions
A new type of participant has been introduced (new for 2021-2027), the so-called associated
partners. They may implement action tasks, but in contrast to affiliated entities they do not
need to have a capital or legal link to a beneficiary and cost incurred by associated partners
can NOT be declared as eligible cost. In contrast to third parties giving in-kind contributions,
the associated partners are fully named in the Grant Agreement and may implement
important action tasks by themselves.
Entities that do not request funding or are not eligible for funding may participate in EU
actions as associated partners, for example out of interest in contributing to the objectives of
the action, gaining visibility, or participating due to ongoing (R&D) cooperation with a
beneficiary.
As with any other participant that does not sign the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries need
to ensure (e.g. through the consortium agreement) that associated partners implement their
action tasks in accordance with the Grant Agreement.
Where possible, associated partners should be linked to a specific beneficiary.
Combination of roles
In principle, each person or entity should only participate in a single role in an action. This is
to avoid any potential conflicts of interest and ensure clear allocation of rights and obligations
as well as certainty on cost eligibility.
A combination of roles within the same action is only possible in the following very limited
cases provided it is not used in a way to circumvent rules of the Grant Agreement:
- Associated partner + third party giving in-kind contribution: If necessary for
the implementation of the action, associated partners implementing their own tasks
may also support beneficiaries and affiliated entities in the implementation of their
tasks by providing in-kind contributions.
- Associated partner/third party giving in-kind contribution/ + subcontractor:
It is in principle possible for an associated partner or a third party giving in-kind
contributions in support of certain parts of the action to also compete for subcontracts
for other parts of the same action. If, in accordance with the criteria for awarding
14EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
subcontracts (best value for money or lowest price, no conflict of interest), an
associated partner or a third party already giving in-kind contributions gives the best
offer, it may also participate as a subcontractor.
- Recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) + any other role:
Recipients of financial support to third parties must normally be third parties to the
agreement. Beneficiaries are not allowed to provide financial support under the Grant
Agreement to themselves or their affiliated entities. However, certain exceptions may
be made if explicitly allowed in the call conditions/Grant Agreement and justified in
the DoA Annex 1 (e.g. for HE Co-funded Partnerships, see Annex 5 > HE Co-funded
Partnerships). By contrast, in the case of third parties providing in-kind contributions
or subcontractors, assuming that the financial support is not directly related to their
tasks, they are considered third parties to the agreement and may therefore in
principle receive financial support to third parties under the conditions set out in the
Grant Agreement.

1. Consortium: Coordinator — Beneficiaries — Affiliated entities — Other
participants
In EU grants, the consortium is normally composed of the key project participants, i.e.
typically the coordinator and the other beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated
partners. Sometimes also subcontractors and third parties that contribute to the action are
included.
The coordinator is the beneficiary which is the central contact point for the granting
authority and represents the consortium (towards the granting authority). For mono-
beneficiary grants, the mono-beneficiary also has the coordinator role.
The signature arrangements are the following:
− the coordinator directly signs the Grant Agreement
− the other beneficiaries sign the Grant Agreement by signing the Accession Form (see
Article 40). Only beneficiaries sign the Accession Form. Affiliated entities, associated
partners etc. do NOT sign the Accession Form.
Amendments to the GA, if any, will be signed by the coordinator on behalf of the other
beneficiaries.
The division of roles and responsibilities within the consortium are explained in Article 7.
Generally speaking:
− the coordinator must coordinate and manage the grant, including distribution of
payments received from the granting authority, and is the central contact point for the
granting authority
− the beneficiaries must collectively together contribute to a smooth and successful
implementation of the project (i.e. implement their part of the action properly, comply
with their own obligations under the Grant Agreement and support the coordinator in
his obligations).
The beneficiaries are bound by the grant terms and conditions. This means that they must:
18EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− carry out the action as described in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of the
Grant Agreement) and
− comply with all the other provisions of the Grant Agreement and all the applicable
provisions of EU, international and national law (including general principles, such as
fundamental rights, values, and ethical principles).
The involvement of other participants which do not sign the Grant Agreement (affiliated
entities, associated partners, subcontractors, etc) varies depending on the role. Since there is
no formal contractual link with them, their obligations will always be enforced through the
responsible beneficiaries.
The consortium set-up must follow the roles in the Grant Agreement.
Participants should be attributed their roles according to their real contribution to the project.
The main actors should be the beneficiaries or affiliated entities. All other roles should be
complementary.
This means for instance:
− affiliated entities — are allowed to fully participate in the action; they are treated like
beneficiaries for most issues (including cost eligibility); they do not however have
access to the Portal My Area section (see Article 36); annotations in this AGA which
refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to affiliated entities (just like the provisions of
the MGA themselves; see also MGA Preamble)
− subcontracting — beneficiaries/affiliated entities may NOT subcontract tasks to other
beneficiaries/affiliated entities
− coordinator tasks — the coordinator tasks listed in the Grant Agreement may NOT be
subcontracted (they can only be delegated, under certain circumstances, to an entity
with ‘authorisation to administer’ or in the case of ‘sole beneficiaries’ within the
meaning of Article 190(2) of the Financial Regulation 2024/25094; see Article 7).
For an overview on the different types of third parties and their roles, rights and obligations
under the Grant Agreement, see the table in Article 7.
If you are an assocation with members who will implement some of the action activities (or an
European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) or joint venture), you should make sure that the
members participate as affiliated entities, so that they will be able to charge their costs to the
project. Otherwise these costs will NOT be eligible.
2. Name and address — Legal entity data
The legal entity data (legal name, address, legal representatives, etc) of the beneficiaries
comes from the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register (former ‘Beneficiary Register’).
This data will be automatically used for all communications concerning the grant (see Article
36) and will also be used in case you are applying for other EU grants, prizes or tenders (if
managed through the Portal).
The beneficiaries (via their legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)) must keep their data in
the Participant Register up-to-date at all times including after the end of the grant (see Article
19).

1. Data Sheet
The Data Sheet shows ALL options in the Grant Agreement (i.e. all provisions in the terms
and conditions that are flagged as options — marked by red or green brackets).
The Data Sheet uses the IT labels that are used by the Portal Grant Management System for
the automatic generation of the contracts.
These labels do NOT necessarily reflect the precise legal provisions and must therefore ALWAYS
be cross-checked with the full text of the corresponding provision in the terms and conditions
Examples:
1. The options ‘Actual costs/Unit or actual cost’ for travel and subsistence in the Data Sheet are linked to the
corresponding Options in Article 6.2.C.1. Thus, ‘Unit or actual costs’ does NOT mean that the beneficiaries
can freely choose which cost form to use. The cost form to be used is prescribed by the conditions in Article
6.2.C.1.
2. The options ‘Yes/No’ for VAT in the Data Sheet are linked to the Options in Article 6.3(viii). Thus, ‘Yes’
means eligible under the conditions set out in that provision (Article 6.3(viii)); ‘No’ means always ineligible.
Red options are options which have been selected at programme- or type of action-level.
Green options are options that are selected either at call- or project-level.

ARTICLE 1 — SUBJECT OF THE AGREEMENT
This Agreement sets out the rights and obligations and terms and conditions applicable to the grant awarded
[OPTION for SGAs: under Framework Partnership Agreement No [insert number] — [insert acronym]] for
the implementation of the action set out in Chapter 2.
1. Subject of the Grant Agreement
The Grant Agreement sets out the rights and obligations of each party and the terms and
conditions of the grant that beneficiaries must comply with when implementing the action
(i.e. the project).
Grants are public funding in form of donation (i.e. a free, non-reimbursable contribution). The
EU donates to actions because it is a way to incentivise activities that are in the public policy
interest. It is a positive way to support and involve citizens and encourage broad cooperation
across borders without taking ownership in the action.
The granting authority is NOT procuring your work, goods or services, nor is your project
‘done for the European Commission’ or any other EU granting authority.

CHAPTER 2 ACTION
General > Article 3 — Action
ARTICLE 3 — ACTION
ARTICLE 3 — ACTION
The grant is awarded for the action [insert project number] — [insert acronym] (‘action’), as described in
Annex 1.
[OPTION for programmes with linked actions: [OPTION if selected for the grant16: This action is linked to
the action(s) set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 1) (‘linked actions’).]]
16 Linked actions cover all types of joint/combined/coordinated actions, where the action implementation should be linked to another action
(e.g. Horizon complementary grants, Horizon joint actions; Horizon MSCA SNLS grants, EDIDP COFUND, JU implementing grants,
etc.).
1. Actions
The grant is awarded to allow the consortium to implement the action as described in the
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement (i.e. the project).
Depending on the EU programme under which the grant is awarded, your action may belong
to a specific type of action that is mentioned in the call conditions (e.g. Project Grants, Lump
Sum Grants, Infrastructure Grants, Grants for Procurement, Coordination and Support
Actions, etc).
2. Linked actions
Linked actions are used when the granting authority wishes to establish a formal link between
your action and other activities, that may for example complement, precede or succeed your
project.
The linked action is identified in the Grant Agreement (see Data Sheet, Point 1) and may
refer to any formally set-up activity, such as other EU grants, but also grants from EU
Member States or international organisations, blended finance, or activities carried out under
procurement contracts, etc.
The beneficiaries of both actions must have arrangements, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly. If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet,
Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written collaboration agreement (or, if the
consortia are identical, as part of their consortium agreement; see Article 7).
Specific cases (linked actions):
EU Synergy actions — When projects are part of EU ‘Synergy calls’ (i.e. jointly coordinated
calls that pursue common policy objectives and allow for the combination of funding), they
will always be flagged as ‘Synergy actions’ and benefit from the special cost eligibility rules in
Article 6.3. Other actions (not part of a ‘Synergy call’) can be flagged by the granting
authority as ‘Synergy action’ on request. This is typically needed if an action should benefit
from different combined EU grants. In this case, the beneficiaries must inform both granting
authorities so that they can take measures to prevent double funding. For details, see Article
6.3.

General > Article 4 — Duration and starting date
ARTICLE 4 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE
ARTICLE 4 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE
The duration and the starting date of the action are set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 1).
1. Action starting date
The action starting date is fixed in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement.
It is usually the first day of the month following the grant signature. But the parties can also
agree to a fixed starting date (if justified during grant preparation, e.g. conference that must
take place on a specific date).
The fixed starting date should normally be in the future (after grant signature) but it is
possible to propose an earlier starting date (retroactive).
Be however aware that by starting the action before signing the GA, you risk that the starting
date will not be accepted by the granting authority (which will assess the compliance with
applicable rules) or that the grant will not be signed, and no costs will be eligible (e.g. for
activities implemented before signature of the grant). Conversely, starting dates far in the
future affect normally also the timing of your (first) pre-financing payment.
The action starting date can normally NOT be before the submission of the proposal —
unless the Programme Regulation (basic act) allows this or in cases of emergency, e.g. for
humanitarian aid and civil protection, for urgencies in the veterinary or phytosanitary domain, etc.
The starting date will also affect the eligibility of costs (see Article 6.1(a)(ii)).
2. Action duration
The action duration is fixed in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement.
It usually comes from your proposal (based on the call conditions) and is expressed as a
number of months, running from the action starting date.
The action end date shown in the system is the date that is automatically calculated from the
starting date (starting date + months of duration).
The action duration relates only to the period during which the action tasks (set out in Annex 1)
are implemented. This is NOT the same as project closure (i.e. final payment) or the end of the
Grant Agreement. After the action end date, the beneficiaries still have to submit their final report
and the granting authority will have to make the payment of the balance. Moreover, certain
obligations under the Grant Agreement continue even afterwards (e.g. keeping supporting
documents in case of audits, continue to use certain equipment for the same objective, maintain
the website of the project if required, etc).

CHAPTER 3 GRANT
General > Article 5 — Grant
ARTICLE 5 — GRANT
ARTICLE 5 — GRANT
5.1 Form of grant
The grant is an action grant17 which takes the form of a [budget-based][activity-based] mixed actual cost
grant (i.e. a grant based on actual costs incurred, but which may also include other forms of funding, such as
unit costs or contributions, flat-rate costs or contributions, lump sum costs or contributions or financing not
linked to costs).
5.2 Maximum grant amount
The maximum grant amount is set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 3) and in the estimated budget (Annex 2).
[OPTION for programmes with contingency reserve: [OPTION if selected for the call: The maximum grant
amount can be raised at the end of the action, by activating the contingency reserve set out in the Data Sheet
(see Point 3).]]
5.3 Funding rate
[OPTION 1 for programmes with single funding rate (per action): The funding rate for costs is […]% of the
action’s eligible costs. Contributions are not subject to any funding rate.]
5.4 Estimated budget, budget categories and forms of funding
The estimated budget for the action is set out in Annex 2.
It contains the estimated eligible costs and contributions for the action, broken down by participant [OPTION
for programmes with activity-based budget:, type of activity] and budget category.
Annex 2 also shows the types of costs and contributions (forms of funding)19 to be used for each budget
category.
If unit costs or contributions are used, the details on the calculation will be explained in Annex 2a.
5.5 Budget flexibility
The budget breakdown may be adjusted — without an amendment (see Article 39) — by transfers (between
participants and budget categories), as long as this does not imply any substantive or important change to the
description of the action in Annex 1.
However:
- changes to the budget category for volunteers (if used) always require an amendment
- changes to budget categories with lump sums costs or contributions (if used; including financing not
linked to costs) always require an amendment
- changes to budget categories with higher funding rates or budget ceilings (if used) always require an
amendment
- addition of amounts for subcontracts not provided for in Annex 1 either require an amendment or
simplified approval in accordance with Article 6.2
- other changes require an amendment or simplified approval, if specifically provided for in Article
6.2
- [OPTION 1 by default: flexibility caps: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes with flexibility
caps: [OPTION 1 by default: flexibility caps: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the call:
flexibility caps: [transfers between budget categories of more than [20%][[…%]] [of the total costs
and contributions][per budget category] set out in Annex 2 require an amendment][[other]]]] .
17 For the definition, see Article 183(2)(a) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: ‘action grant’ means an EU grant to finance “an action
intended to help achieve a Union policy objective”.
19 See Article 125 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
34EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Form of grant
EU grants are normally ‘budget-based mixed actual cost’ grants (meaning grants, broken
down by budget categories and participants, and based on actual costs incurred and other
simplified forms of funding (e.g. normally unit costs for SME owners/natural person
beneficiaries and volunteers, if applicable and flat rate costs for indirect costs).
However, depending on the programme and on the type of action, grants may also be:
− pure actual cost grants (e.g. some operating grants)
− pure lump sum grants
− pure unit grants
− ‘activity-based mixed actual cost’ grants, i.e. broken down by budget categories as
well as by activities
or
− any other combination of costs and/or contributions.
For guidance on other types of grants, see How to manage your lump sum grants.
Ge neral > Article 5.2 Maximum grant amount
2. Maximum grant amount
The maximum grant amount set out in this Article defines the maximum amount of funding
that the granting authority has available for the grant. It is a ceiling and not necessarily the
‘final grant amount’ and in any case not a ‘price’ due to the beneficiaries. It can NOT be
exceeded, e.g. to accommodate higher or anticipated cost.
The maximum grant amount can NOT be increased — even if the eligible costs of the action
are higher than planned.
Specific cases (maximum grant amount):
Contingency reserve (RELEX) — In some programmes, the maximum grant amount
foreseen in the award decision may go beyond the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 to
accommodate a ‘contingency reserve’. In this case, the maximum grant amount in Annex 2
can be raised during the action by activating the contingency reserve (— up to the maximum
grant amount set out in the award decision). This requires the agreement of the granting
authority and must be requested through an amendment (see Article 39).
General > Article 5.3 Funding rate
3. Funding rate
EU grants are normally subject to ‘co-financing’ or ‘co-funding’, meaning that the EU granting
authority does only provide a part of the funding of the action and the remaining parts must
be financed from the beneficiaries’ own resources, income generated by the action (e.g. by
selling results), or financial or in-kind contributions from third parties (e.g. grants from
national or private funding programmes). As such, the EU grants are normally subject to a
single funding rate for the entire action — which is expressed as a fixed percentage and
announced in the call conditions. Through the application of the funding rate (a percentage of
the eligible cost), co-financing is ensured as the remaining no eligible cost will need to be
35EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
covered from other sources. Normally the granting authority does not require any further
information on the sources of co-financing, unless specifically requested for the action.
For some programmes and types of action (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, I3, ERDF-TA, SMP,
RELEX), there are however several funding rates inside the project. These may depend on:
− the type of beneficiaries (e.g. SMEs; for-profit or non-profit legal entities, place of
establishment etc)
− the type of cost categories to be covered (e.g. FSTP)
− the type of activities to be performed (for activity-based grants).
Where funding rates are based on the type of beneficiary, beneficiaries and their affiliated
entities will be assessed separately. The funding rate of a beneficiary does NOT condition the
funding rate of its affiliated entities.
Example: The beneficiary is entitled to a 70 % funding rate, it has an affiliated entity entitled to a
funding rate of 100 %. The cost incurred by the affiliated entities will be funded at 100 % —
despite the lower funding rate of the beneficiary to which it is linked.
In order to avoid abuse, the budget flexibility is restricted. Changes that would entail a higher
funding rate (e.g. change between budget category or activity, relocation of budget (and
tasks) to a beneficiary with higher rate) are always subject to an amendment. Changes
between beneficiaries with different funding rates will be monitored closely, to ensure that
no disproportionate amount of tasks and budget is transferred from the beneficiary to its
affiliated entity or vice versa in order to unduly profit from funding rate differences (budget
transfers that result in substantive or important changes, i.e. changes that would also affect
the description of the action in Annex 1, are subject to a mandatory amendment).
Conditions for the funding rate must normally be complied with throughout the action.
Thus, a change of activity, type of beneficiary, etc. affecting the conditions for the funding rate,
would also require a change of the funding rate (including specific increases or bonuses based on
pre-set conditions) in line with the original call conditions.
General > Article 5.4 Estimated budget, budget categories and forms of funding
4. Estimated budget
The estimated budget of the action is calculated on the basis of the estimated eligible costs
and — if applicable —contributions submitted by the consortium, and is annexed to the Grant
Agreement (Annex 2).
The estimated budget also determines the maximum grant amount for each
beneficiary/affiliated entity and for the action as a whole (see above).
5. Budget categories and forms of funding
The budget categories are listed in Article 6.2 and reflected, for each programme and type
of action, in the budget table in Annex 2.
The standard budget categories which usually apply are the following:
− Personnel costs
− Costs for employees (or equivalent)
− Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract
− Costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment
− Costs for SME owners/beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary (not
all programmes)
36EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− Costs for volunteers’ work (not all programmes)
− Costs for other personnel categories (only SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
− Subcontracting costs
− Purchase costs
− Travel costs, accommodation costs and subsistence costs (all programmes
except RFCS, CCEI)
− Equipment costs
− Costs of other goods, works and services
− Other cost categories
− Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (all programmes except RFCS, EUAF,
CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM)
− Internally invoiced goods and services (only HE, DEP and EDF)
− Indirect costs
Depending on the EU programme and on the the type of action, additional programme-
specific budget categories may apply, for instance:
− HE Access to research infrastructure costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_RI)
− HE PCP/PPI procurement costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_PCP/PPI)
− HE ERC additional funding (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_ERC_Additional funding)
− CEF Studies (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Studies)
− CEF Synergetic elements (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Synergetic elements)
− CEF Works in outermost regions (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Works in outermost regions)
− CEF Land purchase ( see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Land purchase)
− LIFE Land purchase (see Article 6.2.D.X LIFE_Land purchase)
− AMIF EMN ad hoc queries (see Article 6.2.D.X AMIF_EMN ad hoc queries)
These budget categories may be cost-based (actual costs, unit costs, flat-rate costs, lump
sum costs, costs according to usual cost accounting practices) or contribution-based, i.e.
fixed by the granting authority on the basis of a cost-related methodology including e.g.
indirect cost (unit contribution, lump sum contribution, flat-rate contribution) or a non-cost
related methodology (financing not linked to cost). Which of these forms of funding applies,
is shown, for each budget category, in the estimated budget (Annex 2).
If unit costs or contributions are used, the details on the calculation will be explained in
Annex 2a of the Grant Agreement.
General > Article 5.5 Budget flexibility
6. Budget transfers (budget flexibility)
The budget in Annex 2 is an estimation. The budget is therefore in principle flexible (with
certain exceptions, see below).
37EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
A transfer can NOT lead to an increase of the maximum grant amount.
Moreover, you should be aware that the budget table is considered by the granting authority
to reflect the actual situation and may therefore be the basis for certain decisions, such as the
calculation of amounts to be offset from (pre-financing) payments for beneficiaries that have
outstanding debts to the Commission (see Article 22).
As a general principle, beneficiaries may transfer budget among themselves, between
affiliated entities or between budget categories (without requesting an amendment; see
Article 39) and — at the time of reporting — declare costs that are different from the
estimated budget provided that the action remains in line with the description of the action in
Annex 1 (if this is not the case, an amendment is needed, under the conditions of Article 39).
If the incurred eligible costs during the action implementation turn out to be lower than the
estimated eligible costs, the difference can thus be allocated to another beneficiary or
another budget category. The amount reimbursed for the other beneficiary/other budget
category (to which the budget transfer is intended) may thus be higher than planned.
Example: The estimated budget includes personnel costs of EUR 60 000 for beneficiary A and EUR
75 000 for beneficiary B. However, at the end of the action, the actual personnel costs of beneficiary
A are EUR 75 000 due to an increase in salaries or to the need to employ additional personnel to
carry out the tasks mentioned in Annex 1 while the actual personnel costs of beneficiary B are EUR
60 000. This may be acceptable provided the additional costs of beneficiary A fulfil the eligibility
requirements of Article 6 and up to the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 (at the level of the
action).
The following changes always require an amendment:
− changes to the description of the action in Annex 1
− changes to the budget category for volunteers (if used)
− changes to budget categories with lump sums costs or contributions (if used; including
financing not linked to costs)
− changes to budget categories or activities with higher funding rates or budget ceilings
(if used)
− activation of the contingency reserve (where foreseen in the Grant Agreement).
The following require either an amendment or a simplified approval procedure:
− addition of amounts for subcontracts not provided for in Annex 1
− other changes in certain specific cost categories, if specifically provided for in Article
6.2.
Best practice: In case of doubt, the coordinator should consult the granting authority on
whether a change requires an amendment or — at least — a simplified approval procedure.
Specific cases (grant)
Simplified approval procedure (general)— For some cases and types of cost indicated,
the Grant Agreement provides for simplified approval procedures, meaning that beneficiaries
can ask for an ex post approval by the granting authority to accept costs which have been
incurred, but were not planned in the estimated budget. For such simplified approval, they
must declare the costs in question in the next periodic report and flag and justify them.
Simplified approval is however at the full discretion of the granting authority. This means that
the beneficiaries bear the risk that the costs might not be approved at interim or final
payment-stage later on.
Flexibility caps — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, transfers between
budget categories going beyond a certain threshold percentage require an amendment. In
38EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
this case, unauthorised changes going beyond the threshold may be rejected (cost rejection,
applied to beneficiaries concerned/equally among the consortium members).
Financial support to third parties (FSTP) — A transfer from the budget category of
financial support to third parties to any other category usually implies a significant change to
the nature of the action and often requires also changes to the description of the action.
Therefore, such a transfer normally requires an amendment of the Grant Agreement.

6.1 General eligibility conditions
ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
In order to be eligible, costs and contributions must meet the eligibility conditions set out in this Article.
6.1 General eligibility conditions
The general eligibility conditions are the following:
(a) for actual costs:
(i) they must be actually incurred by the beneficiary
(ii) they must be incurred in the period set out in Article 4 (with the exception of costs relating
to the submission of the final periodic report, which may be incurred afterwards; see
Article 21)
(iii) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(iv) they must be incurred in connection with the action as described in Annex 1 and necessary
for its implementation
(v) they must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts
in accordance with the accounting standards applicable in the country where the
beneficiary is established and with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices
(vi) they must comply with the applicable national law on taxes, labour and social security and
(vii) they must be reasonable, justified and must comply with the principle of sound financial
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency
(b) for unit costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the units must:
- be actually used or produced by the beneficiary in the period set out in Article 4
(with the exception of units relating to the submission of the final periodic report,
which may be used or produced afterwards; see Article 21)
- be necessary for the implementation of the action and
(iii) the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records
and documentation (see Article 20)
(c) for flat-rate costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the costs or contributions to which the flat-rate is applied must:
- be eligible
- relate to the period set out in Article 4 (with the exception of costs or contributions
relating to the submission of the final periodic report, which may be incurred
afterwards; see Article 21)
40EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(d) for lump sum costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the work must be properly implemented by the beneficiary in accordance with Annex 1
(iii) the deliverables/outputs must be achieved in the period set out in Article 4 (with the
exception of deliverables/outputs relating to the submission of the final periodic report,
which may be achieved afterwards; see Article 21)
(e) for unit, flat-rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to usual cost accounting practices (if
any):
(i) they must fulfil the general eligibility conditions for the type of cost concerned
(ii) the cost accounting practices must be applied in a consistent manner, based on objective
criteria, regardless of the source of funding
(f) for financing not linked to costs (if any), the results must be achieved or the conditions must be
fulfilled as described in Annex 1.
In addition, for direct cost categories (e.g. personnel, travel & subsistence, subcontracting and other direct
costs) only costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed to it
directly are eligible. They must not include any indirect costs (i.e. costs that are only indirectly linked to the
action, e.g. via cost drivers).
[OPTION for programmes with in-kind contributions eligible: In-kind contributions provided by third
parties free-of charge may be declared as eligible direct costs by the beneficiaries which use them (under the
same conditions as if they were their own, provided that they concern only direct costs and that the third
parties and their in-kind contributions are set out in Annex 1 (or approved ex post in the periodic report, if
their use does not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; ‘simplified approval procedure’).]
1. Eligible costs
The grant can only reimburse eligible costs (and, where applicable, contributions; see Article
6.2.F), i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific conditions set out in this Article.
Therefore, beneficiaries/affiliated entities must enter ONLY eligible costs into the estimated
budget (see Article 5.4), and later on into the financial statements (see Article 21). If
ineligible costs are declared, they will be rejected (see Article 27).
Article 6.1 lists the general eligibility conditions for each form of funding (actual costs, unit,
flat-rate, lump sum, costs according to usual cost accounting practices, financing not linked
to costs); Article 6.2 refers to the specific eligibility conditions for each budget category.
Cost eligibility is NOT the same as beneficiary/action eligibility. The latter are normally
checked upstream (before grant signature/amendment), in order to make sure that only eligible
beneficiaries/actions are selected for a grant. Loss of beneficiary/action eligibility during an ongoing
grant normally leads to termination or change of status (see Articles 32 and 39); costs become
automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility.
For a consolidated list of eligibility issues relating to specific situations/legal framework in
individual countries, see AGA — List of country-specific issues.
41EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. General eligibility conditions for actual costs
In order to be eligible, actual costs must be:
− actually incurred by the beneficiary/affiliated entity, i.e.:
− real and not estimated, budgeted or imputed and
− definitively and genuinely borne by the beneficiary/affiliated entity (not by any
other entity)
− incurred during the action duration, i.e. the generating event that triggers the costs
must take place during the action duration set out in the Data Sheet.
If costs are invoiced or paid later than the end date, they are eligible only if the debt
existed already during the action duration (supported by documentary evidence) and
the final cost are known at the moment of the final report.
Example: Costs of services or equipment supplied to a beneficiary may be invoiced and paid
after the end date of the action, e.g. because of warranty periods, if the services or equipment
were used by the beneficiary during the action duration. By contrast, costs of services or
equipment supplied after the end of the action (or after GA termination) are normally not
eligible.
− entered as eligible costs in the estimated budget, under the relevant budget
category in Annex 2
This requirement is in practice automatically ensured by the IT system, since the
financial statements mirror the budget categories that are available for the estimated
budget. The only thing you need to pay attention to, is whether all the special cost
categories (visible in the estimated budget and financial statements for the
programme) are really eligible under the specific call you applied for (e.g. financial
support to third parties (FSTP), etc; see call conditions). If not, you should leave those
columns empty and NOT enter any costs (they are ineligible and will be rejected).
The requirement also has no impact on budget flexibility; costs may be transferred
between beneficiaries and eligible budget categories without amending the Grant
Agreement, under the conditions set out in Article 5.5.
− connected to the action and necessary for its implementation as described in
Annex 1, i.e. to achieve the action’s objectives
The grant cannot be used to finance activities other than those approved by the
granting authority.
Examples:
1. The activities of the project cost less than foreseen so the beneficiary decides to conduct
additional activities including for example hiring additional staff, organising an additional event,
renewing office equipment. Additional activities regularly require a change of the description of
the action (Annex 1). To be eligible, such reallocation of ‘savings’ need to be pre-discussed with
the granting authority and may regularly require an amendment.
2. Activities that violate the Grant Agreement (e.g. activities that are against the call conditions,
against applicable law, against EU values, etc.) can never be necessary for the implementation
of the action and therefore any cost related to such activities do not fulfil the general eligibility
conditions.
− identifiable and verifiable, i.e. come directly from the beneficiary/affiliated entity’s
accounts, be directly reconcilable with them and supported by documentation
The records and supporting documents must show the actual costs of the work, i.e.
what was actually paid or recorded in the beneficiary’s profit and loss accounts (see
Article 20).
42EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs must be calculated according to the applicable accounting rules of the country in
which the beneficiary is established and according to the beneficiary’s usual cost
accounting practices.
Example: If a beneficiary always charges a particular cost as an indirect cost, it must do so
also for EU and Euratom grants, and should not charge it as a direct cost.
Be aware however, that the usual cost accounting practices may NOT be used as an
excuse for non-compliance with other Grant Agreement provisions. You must bring
your usual cost accounting practices in line with the Grant Agreement (e.g. conditions
for calculating personnel costs; conditions for charging depreciation costs, etc.).
− in compliance with applicable national laws on taxes, labour and social security
and
− reasonable, justified and must comply with the principles of sound financial
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency (i.e. be in line with
good housekeeping practice when spending public money and not be excessive).
‘Economy’ means minimising the costs of resources used for an activity (input), while
maximising quality; ‘efficiency’ is the relationship between outputs and the resources
used to produce them.
Examples:
1. The beneficiary may NOT increase the remuneration of its personnel, upgrade its travel policy
or its purchasing rules because of the grant support.
2. Entertainment or hospitality expenses (including gifts, special meals and dinners) are
generally not eligible.
3. Tips which are not obligatory are not eligible. By contrast, in some countries the invoice
includes a certain mandatory amount as payment for the ‘service’. In this case, the amount
may be considered eligible — if the other eligibility conditions are fulfilled.
Double funding risk — A cost item or element can NOT be declared more than once within
the same or another budget category or activity (e.g. cost for internally invoiced goods and
services cannot include cost elements already charged under equipment cost).
Specific cases (actual costs):
Costs related to preparing, submitting and negotiating the proposals — Can generally
NOT be declared as eligible for the action (they are incurred before the action starts), this
includes cost for the preparation of the consortium agreement which should be signed before
the action starts. However, costs related to updating the consortium agreement may be
eligible if incurred during the action duration and in line with the general and specific
eligibility conditions, in particular being necessary for the implementation of the action.
Travel costs for the kick-off/closing meeting — Even if the first leg of the journey takes
place before the action starting date (e.g. the day before the kick-off meeting), the costs may
be eligible, if the meeting is held during the action duration. The same applies for the last leg
of a journey after the end of the action duration for a closing meeting.
Costs for reporting at the end of the action — Costs related to drafting and submitting
the final report are eligible even if they are incurred after the action duration.
Those costs include the cost of certificates on the financial statements (CFS) required by the
Grant Agreement and the cost of participating in a project review carried out by the granting
authority before the submission of the final report. They may also include the cost of
personnel necessary for the project review or to prepare the final report. However, they can
NOT include any other action activities foreseen in the Annex 1 and undertaken after the end
date of the action. For the daily rate to use for such personnel costs, see Article 6.2.A.1.
43EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs to allow for the participation of disabled people (e.g. costs for sign language
interpreters required for dissemination events organised under the action) — Are eligible if
they fulfil the general and specific eligibility conditions listed under Articles 6.1 and 6.2. The
beneficiaries must keep records (see Article 20) to prove in case of an audit, check or review
the actual costs incurred and that they were necessary for the implementation of the action.
Examples:
1. When subcontracting the organisation of an event that is necessary for the implementation of the
action, a beneficiary may select an offer that ensures full accessibility for persons with disability
under the consideration of best value for money instead of the lowest price.
2. When purchasing goods that are necessary for the implementation of the action, a beneficiary
may purchase goods that ensure accessibility for disabled persons even if this entails a higher
expense than comparable goods that do not offer accessibility.
Cost for security measures — Where the implementation of an action requires additional
security measures, costs can be declared under the appropriate cost category (e.g. personnel
costs for security staff, equipment costs for secure rooms, etc) if in line with the general and
specific eligibility conditions, in particular these cost must be directly connected to the action
and necessary for its implementation. Conversely, costs for security not directly connected to
the action (i.e. normal security measures of the beneficiaries with or without the EU action)
are considered to be fully covered by the indirect costs.
3. General eligibility conditions for unit costs
In order to be eligible, unit costs or contributions must be:
− calculated by multiplying the number of actual units used to carry out the work (e.g.
number of hours worked on the action, number of tests performed, etc.) or produced
by the amount per unit
− the number of units must be necessary for the action
− the units must be used or produced during the action duration
and
− the beneficiaries must be able to show the link between the number of units declared
and the work on the action.
The records and supporting documents must show that the number of units declared was
actually used for the action (see Article 20). The actual costs of the work are not relevant.
Example: A beneficiary which is an SME declares for its owner who does not receive a salary 50
days worked for an action in 2022. If there is an audit, the SME beneficiary must be able to show
a record of the number of days worked by the owner for the action.
Specific cases (unit costs):
Costs declared on the basis of the usual cost accounting practices — If this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA: Average personnel
costs; HE, DEP, EDF: Internally invoiced goods and services), the beneficiaries must use unit
costs using their own usual cost accounting practices. In this case: neither the amount per
unit, nor the calculation method will be set out in Annex 2a of the Grant Agreement.
4. General eligibility conditions for flat-rate costs
In order to be eligible, flat-rate costs or contributions must be:
− calculated by applying a flat rate to certain costs (whether actual, unit or lump sum
costs).
Example (7 % flat rate for indirect costs — most programmes):
44EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
A beneficiary is working on an action and uses a daily rate of EUR 240 for personnel costs. The
beneficiary declares as eligible 40 day-equivalents of personnel costs + EUR 1 400 for other
goods, works and services + EUR 1 500 for subcontracting during the first reporting period.
Eligible direct costs: (40 x 240 = 9 600) + 1 400 + 1 500 = 12 500
Eligible indirect cost: 7 % flat-rate of 12 500= EUR 875
Total eligible costs: 12 500 + 875 = EUR 13 375.
Funding rate of 70 % = EUR 9 362,50.
Example (25 % flat rate for indirect costs — HE, EDF):
A beneficiary is working on an innovation action and uses a daily rate of EUR 240 for personnel
costs. The beneficiary declares as eligible 40 day-equivalents of personnel costs + EUR 1 400
for other goods and services + EUR 1 500 for subcontracting during the first reporting period.
Eligible direct costs: (40 x 240 = 9 600) + 1 400 + 1 500 = 12 500
Eligible indirect cost: 25 % flat-rate of 9 600 + 1 400 (not the 1 500 for subcontracting as the
flat-rate does not apply on this specific cost category) = EUR 2 750
Total eligible costs: 12 500 + 2 750 = EUR 15 250
Funding rate of 70 % = EUR 10 675.
The records and supporting documents must show that the costs to which the flat-rate is
applied are eligible (see Article 20). If a flat-rate is applied, the actual indirect costs are not
relevant for the granting authority and it is not necessary to calculate them precisely nor to
keep any supporting document related to these.
5. General eligibility conditions for lump sum costs
In order to be eligible:
− the lump sum costs or contributions must correspond to the amount of lump sum
costs set out in Annex 2
− the work must have been carried out in accordance to Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement
− the output or result triggering payment of the lump sum must have been achieved
during the action duration.
The records and supporting documents must show that the action tasks have been carried
out as described in Annex 1. The actual costs of the work are not relevant.
6. Financing not linked to costs
In order to be eligible:
− the results must be achieved or the conditions must be fulfilled as described in
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement during the action duration.
7. Direct and indirect costs
‘Direct costs’ are specific costs directly linked to the performance of the action and which can
therefore be directly booked to it.
They are:
− either costs that have been caused in full by the activities of the action
− or costs that have been caused in full by the activities of several actions (projects),
the attribution of which to a single action can, and has been, directly measured (i.e.
not attributed indirectly via an allocation key, a cost driver or a proxy).
The beneficiaries must be able to show (with records and supporting evidence) the link to the
action.
45EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Indirect costs’ are costs that cannot be identified as specific costs directly linked to the
performance of the action.
In practice, they are costs whose link to the action can NOT be (or has not been) measured
directly, but only by means of cost drivers or a proxy (i.e. parameters that apportion the total
indirect costs (overheads) among the different activities of the beneficiary).
Which kinds of cost fall under direct or indirect cost depends on the nature of the action
and may therefore vary between programmes and calls.
Where they are reimbursed as flat-rate (e.g. budget category E. Indirect costs in the EU
action grants), you do NOT need to calctulate the indirect costs incurred for the action. They are
covered by the flat-rate and automatically calculated by the IT system.
8. Conditions for eligible in-kind contributions for free (HE)
If eligible under the Grant Agreement (only for HE), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge costs for in-kind contributions made available for free.
What? These cover the costs, which a third party has for resources it contributes to the
action for free (i.e. made available for free for use by the project).
They must be declared under the budget category the beneficiary would use if they were
their own costs (e.g. ‘Personnel costs for seconded persons’, ‘Equipment costs’, ‘Costs for
other goods, works and services’, etc), as actual or unit cost, depending on the rules of the
budget category.
Example: Depreciation costs of equipment contributed free of charge must be declared under
cost category C.2 Equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2).
In addition to the general and specific eligibility conditions of the budget category used
(see Article 6.1 and 6.2), they must be limited to the direct costs incurred by the third party.
Example: A person not receiving a salary and who is the (co)owner of a SME is being seconded
by this SME (third party) to a beneficiary. The direct costs incurred by the SME can be declared
via the SME owner unit cost (daily rate) (see Article 6.2.A.4).
Moreover, the in-kind contribution and the contributing third party must be mentioned in
Annex 1 (simplified approval procedure; see below).
Specific cases (in-kind contributions eligible):
Simplified approval procedure (new in-kind contributions) — If the need for an in-kind
contribution was not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment
in order to introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk
that the granting authority might not approve the new contribution and reject the costs at
interim or final payment-stage later on.
Internal invoicing of goods and services (HE) — For Horizon Europe, the granting
authority can also accept costs that are internally invoiced in the third party providing in-kind
contributions. In this case, they should be declared under cost category D.2 Internally
invoiced goods and services (see Article 6.2.D.2). In that context, the rules on internal
invoicing apply (e.g. indirect (actual) costs of the third party can be included, depending on
the usual cost accounting practices of the third party when calculating its unit cost for
internally invoiced goods and services).

1. Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category.
All programmes follow in principle the basic set of common budget categories from the
General MGA (A. Personnel, B. Subcontracting, C. Purchases and D. Other). However not all
programmes use all the cost categories and some programmes may have special/additional
budget categories.
The eligibility conditions for all currently used budget categories are described in the following
sections.

1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement, beneficiaries/affiliated entities may,
depending on the options that apply, charge ‘Personnel costs’.
This budget category covers the following subcategories:
− Costs for employees (or equivalent) (see Article 6.2.A.1)
− Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract and for personnel seconded
by a third party against payment (see Article 6.2.A.2 and A.3)
− Costs for SME owners not receiving a salary and for beneficiaries that are natural
persons not receiving a salary (see Article 6.2.A.4)
− Costs for volunteers (see Article 6.2.A.5)
− Other personnel costs (see Article 6.2.A.6)
1.2 Depending on the type of personnel cost category, they must be declared as actual or
unit costs (e.g. unit cost for SME owners and volunteers cost, if applicable).
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions for each personnel cost category.

General > Article 6.2.A.1 Employees
A.1 Employees (all programmes except SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
A.1 Costs for employees (or equivalent) are eligible as personnel costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility
conditions and are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an employment contract (or
equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the action.
They must be limited to salaries [additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: (including net
payments during parental leave)], social security contributions, taxes and other costs linked to the
remuneration, if they arise from national law or the employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and
be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred, in accordance with the following method:
{daily rate for the person
multiplied by
number of day-equivalents worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The daily rate must be calculated as:
{annual personnel costs for the person
divided by
215}
The number of day-equivalents declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 20).
[additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: The actual time spent on parental leave by a
person assigned to the action may be deducted from the 215 days indicated in the above formula.]
The total number of day-equivalents declared in EU grants, for a person for a year, cannot be higher than
215[additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: minus time spent on parental leave (if any)].
[OPTION A for programmes with standard rules for supplementary payments: The personnel costs may also
include supplementary payments for personnel assigned to the action (including payments on the basis of
supplementary contracts regardless of their nature), if:
- it is part of the beneficiary’s usual remuneration practices and is paid in a consistent manner
whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required
- the criteria used to calculate the supplementary payments are objective and generally applied by the
beneficiary, regardless of the source of funding used.]
[OPTION B for programmes with project-based supplementary payments:
For personnel which receives supplementary payments for work in projects (project-based remuneration), the
personnel costs must be calculated at a rate which:
- corresponds to the actual remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for the time worked by the
person in the action over the reporting period
- does not exceed the remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for work in similar projects funded
by national schemes (‘national projects reference’)
- is defined based on objective criteria allowing to determine the amount to which the person is
entitled
and
- reflects the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay consistently bonuses or supplementary payments
for work in projects funded by national schemes.
The national projects reference is the remuneration defined in national law, collective labour agreement
or written internal rules of the beneficiary applicable to work in projects funded by national schemes.
49EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If there is no such national law, collective labour agreement or written internal rules or if the project-
based remuneration is not based on objective criteria, the national project reference will be the average
remuneration of the person in the last full calendar year covered by the reporting period, excluding
remuneration paid for work in EU actions.]
[additional OPTION for programmes with average personnel costs: If the beneficiary uses average personnel
costs (unit cost according to usual cost accounting practices), the personnel costs must fulfil the general
eligibility conditions for such unit costs and the daily rate must be calculated:
- using the actual personnel costs recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts and excluding any costs
which are ineligible or already included in other budget categories; the actual personnel costs may be
adjusted on the basis of budgeted or estimated elements, if they are relevant for calculating the
personnel costs, reasonable and correspond to objective and verifiable information
and
- according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner, based on
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.]
1. Employees or equivalent (A.1): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS,
CUST/FISC or where declared ineligible in the call conditions), the beneficiaries/affiliated
entities may charge ‘Costs for employees or equivalent’.
This budget category covers the costs for employees or equivalent that worked in the action,
i.e. persons working for the beneficiary on the basis of an employment contract or equivalent
appointing act.
‘Equivalent appointing act’ means the appointing acts of civil servants (who do not sign
employment contracts, but receive official nominations for their posts).
ONLY costs for personnel assigned to the action (i.e. working for the project according to
internal written instructions, organisation chart or other documented management decision) can
be eligible.
Record-keeping — The monthly declaration of days worked in the project correctly signed
(see Article 20) OR reliable time records will normally be sufficient proof of the assignment to the
action — unless there is other contradicting evidence (e.g. the employment contract indicates that
the person was hired to work on another project).
What not? Cost of persons who work for the beneficiary, but NOT with an employment
contract or equivalent appointing act (e.g. staff provided by a temporary work agency,
seconded staff, self-employed persons with a direct contract with the beneficiary).
1.2 Costs for employees (or equivalent) must be declared as:
− actual personnel costs (standard case)
or
50EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− unit costs in accordance with the usual cost accounting practices (‘average personnel
costs’; if option applies in Grant Agreement; option in HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM,
HUMA).
1.3 The costs for employees (or equivalent) must comply with the eligibility conditions set
out in Article 6.2.A.1, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, etc.; see Article 6.1(a) and (b)) and
− be paid in accordance with national law, the collective labour agreement and the
employment contract/equivalent appointing act.
Generally, you may include, for each person concerned, the following:
− fixed salary
− fixed complements, if they are unconditional entitlements for the person (e.g. family
allowance and contributions to medical insurance schemes set out in national law,
complementary pension plan contributions set out in the collective labour agreement
or other binding documents such as staff regulations)
− variable complements, e.g. bonuses, if:
− they are paid based on objective conditions set out, at least, in the internal
rules of the beneficiary
− they are paid in a consistent manner, e.g. not just for actions supported by EU
grants, and
− where applicable, subject to the specific eligibility conditions for supplementary
payments (see specific cases below)
− social security contributions (mandatory employer and employee contributions)
− taxes linked to the remuneration (e.g. income tax withholding)
− other costs and payments linked to the remuneration if they are justified and
registered as personnel costs in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual remuneration
practices (e.g. benefits in kind like company car made available for the private use,
lunch vouchers, accrual for unconditional severance payments mandatory under
national law or other binding documents such as collective labour agreements or other
binding documents such as staff regulations).
You may NOT include:
− any part of the remuneration which has not been an actual cost for you (for example,
salaries reimbursed by a social security scheme or a private insurance in case of long
sick leave or maternity leave)
− payments of dividends to employees (profit distribution in the form of dividends)
− variable complements based on commercial targets or fund raising targets (because
neither incurred in connection with the work of the action, nor necessary for its
implementation)
− arbitrary bonuses (i.e. bonuses which are not paid based on objective conditions set
out, at least, in the internal rules of the beneficiary or bonuses that are not paid in a
consistent manner)
− bonuses that depend on budget availability on the specific project (e.g. paid only if
there are remaining funds in the budget of a project).
51EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Objective conditions’ means conditions which allow to identify who (e.g. what category of
employees) will receive how much (e.g. 5 € extra per hour, 10 % extra salary in each month
of full dedication) in what cases (e.g. time worked as lead researcher in cooperative projects;
an impartial and transparent assessment procedure on performance).
1.4 Calculation of the personnel costs. In most cases you have to calculate your personnel
costs for the action as follows:
Day- Daily rate
equivalents
{actual personnel
costs during the
Personnel Up to a declarable months within the
costs maximum of: reporting period}
{((215 / 12) divided by
multiplied by the
To be calculated
number of months {maximum
per person for
within the reporting declarable day-
each reporting
period
period) multiplied equivalents}
by the working
time factor}
You must do these calculations normally once per reporting period (RP)5 for each person
who worked in the action.
Adaptations may be needed for specific cases, such as project-based remuneration or
average personnel costs, depending on the applicable options in the Grant Agreement
(see specific cases below). Check the Data Sheet of your Grant Agreement, if specific
options apply.
Regarding the calculation of day-equivalents worked in the action:
It is the sum of the day-equivalents actually worked for the action, rounded to the nearest
half-day, and recorded in the monthly declarations or in your time-recording system (if you
have a reliable time-recording system where you record, at least, all the actual time worked
in the action).
For details on the declarations and on how to convert your working time on the action into
day-equivalents, see explanations in Article 20.
5 Alternatively, the calculation may be done separately for each calendar year within the reporting period, if this is
consistently applied. In that case, the ‘number of months within the reporting period’ referred to in the formulas
is to be understood as the number of months of the respective calendar year that are within the reporting
period.
52EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — In case of work on multiple actions per year, the total
number of day-equivalents declared across EU grants for the person can NOT be higher than 215
per calendar year (or the corresponding pro-rata by multiplying 215 with the working time factor),
to avoid double-funding of personnel cost.
Example: In the reporting period form 01/07/2022 to 31/12/2023 the horizontal ceiling per year for a 50%
part-time employee hired on 01/08/2022 would be:
− 2022: (215/12 x 5 [months employed in the RP]) x 0,5 [part-time] = 45 [rounded]
− 2023: (215/12 x 12) x 0,5 = 107,5
Regarding the maximum declarable day-equivalents:
To calculate the daily rate, you first need to determine the maximum declarable day-
equivalents. Since you may not declare more than 100% of your personnel cost, the number
of declarable day-equivalents in each reporting period is capped. The maximum declarable
day-equivalents for each reporting period are calculated as follows:
{((215 / 12) multiplied by the number of months [during which the person is employed] within the
reporting period) multiplied by the working time factor [e.g. 1 for full-time, 0.5 for 50% part time
etc.]}
You will round up or down to the nearest half day-equivalent.
Examples:
The reporting period runs from 01/01/2022 to 30/06/2022 (6 months):
Full-time case: The person is a full-time permanent employee hired in 2020. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 6 [months])
x 1 [full-time] = 107,5
Part-time case: The person is a 50% part-time permanent employee hired in 2020. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 6) x 0.5
[for 50% part-time] = 54
New hire case: The person is a 50% part-time employee hired on 1/06/2022. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 1 [only June
2022]) x 0.5 = 9
The number of months used for the calculation either equates the length of the reporting
period, or the length of employment of the person during this reporting period, if the latter is
shorter (e.g. the person is newly hired or no longer employed at any point during the
reporting period).
Example: In the reporting period from 01/01/2022 to 31/03/2023 (i.e. 15 months) you hire a new
person starting in full-time on 16/01/2023, with 2,5 months left in the reporting period. The
number of months for the calculation of the maximum declarable day-equivalents is accordingly 2,5,
not 15. The maximum number of declarable day-equivalents is ((215/12) x 2,5) x 1 = 45 [rounded
to the nearest half day-equivalent].
For the purpose of all personnel cost calculations a month is considered to have 30 days.
Example: In the reporting period form 01/05/2022 to 31/03/2023, you calculate the number of
months to be used when an employee is hired from 05/05/2022 until 20/10/2022:
- May: 26 days as of the day of being hired, i.e. 26 / 30 = 0,87 months
- June-September: 4 months
- October: 20 days until end of employment, i.e. 20 / 30 = 0,67 months
That is for the person in the reporting period: (26 / 30) + 4 + (20 / 30) = 5,54 months.
If the working time factor changes for the person during the reporting period (e.g. a change
from part-time to full-time, change of contract), you calculate the maximum declarable day-
equivalents separately for the months before and after this change of condition and add them
up afterwards to calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period.
Example:
53EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In the reporting period from 01/01/2022 to 31/03/2023, you work full-time in 2022 and 50% part-
time in 2023. You calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents separately for 2022 and 2023
(because conditions have changed).
12 months of full-time work: ((215 / 12) x 12) x 1 = 215
3 months of part-time work: ((215 / 12) x 3) x 0.5 = 26,88
Total: The maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period are therefore 215 + 26,88
= 242 (rounded to the nearest half day-equivalent).
Regarding the calculation of the daily rate:
You have to calculate a daily rate per person for the reporting period. For this, (irrespective
of the situation, i.e. full-time, part-time, partial hire, etc), you have to use the following
formula:
{actual personnel costs during the months within the reporting period}
divided by
{maximum declarable day-equivalents}
The actual personnel costs for the person are those eligible cost recorded in accordance with
your usual cost accounting practice in your (statutory) accounts until the end of the reporting
period for which you are calculating the daily rate.
Example: For a reporting period running from 01/01/2022 until 31/03/2023, to calculate the daily
rate (which you will apply to days worked by the person in the action from 01/01/2022 until
31/03/2023) you will take into account the total personnel costs of the person recorded in your
statutory accounts for the 12 months in 2022 and the 3 months in 2023 (January, February and
March).
If in line with the conditions described above, the personnel costs can include any component
that is legally obligatory by national law, the employment contract, or a similar act. Apart
from taxes and social security contributions, this may also include for example the thirteenth
salary, Christmas pay, etc. These personnel costs may also include supplementary payments
for personnel assigned to the action (including payments on the basis of supplementary
contracts regardless of their nature) if that is your usual remuneration practice for the kind of
work or expertise required and based on objective criteria used regardless of the source of
funding (i.e. not just for the individual EU grant).
Example:
In the reporting period from 01/12/2021 to 31/05/2023 (18 months), the person works 50% part-
time from 01/12/2021 to 31/05/2022 (6 months) and full-time afterwards (12 months). You
calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents and the daily rate for the reporting period as
follows:
Maximum declarable day-equivalents: Due to a change from part-time to full-time work, you need
to calculate the declarable day-equivalents separately for the period from 01/12/2021 to
31/05/2022 and afterwards. The 6 months of part-time work calculation would be ((215 / 12) x 6) x
0.5 = 53.75 for the part-time which you would have to add up with the result of the calculation for
the 12 months full-time period, which is 215 (i.e. ((215 / 12) x 12) x 1), the maximum number of
declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period would be 53.75 + 215 = 269 (rounded to
nearest half day-equivalent).
Daily rate: After taking into account all eligible elements (salary plus social contribution and taxes
etc.) you recorded in your accounts a total eligible cost of EUR 15 000 personnel costs for working 6
months part-time and EUR 60 000 for 12 months full-time for a total cost of EUR 75 000. The daily
rate for the person is calculated by dividing the personnel costs for the 18 months of work within
the reporting period with the maximum declarable day-equivalents, i.e. EUR 75 000 divided by 269
= EUR 278.81 daily rate.
For personnel costs related to drafting and submitting the final reports incurred after the
action duration (for example related to participation in a project review or to the preparation
of a final report; see Article 6.1),, the daily rate to be used is the one for the last reporting
period. The extra days should simply be added to the days declared in the final reporting
period; there is NO need to calculate a separate daily rate for them. The threshold of
54EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
maximum declarable day-equivalents (see Article 6.2.A.1) will however NOT apply to the
additional days.
Specific cases (costs for employees or equivalent (A.1)):
Teleworking — Teleworking days are accepted if:
− the beneficiary has in place clear rules allowing for teleworking, and
− the teleworked days were in line with those rules (for example: they did not exceed
the maximum days of teleworking allowed by the beneficiary’s rules).
End-of-contract indemnities during the action — If the employment of a person working
on the action ends during the action, the beneficiary may declare cost for end-of-contract
indemnities, if in line with the general and specific eligibility conditions, and in particular that
it is their usual remuneration practices (e.g. required by national law, not just applied for EU
actions, etc) and that these cost have not been included already in the calculation of the daily
rate (e.g. as accrual for unconditional severance payments mandatory under national law).
The eligible part of the indemnity can be charged in the reporting period in which the
employee’s contract ends. Since the entitlement to such indemnities is most often generated
over a period of time longer than the reporting period (or the action), only the part of the
indemnity that corresponds to the time worked by the person on the action can be charged
(i.e. a pro-rata of the indemnity amount in proportion to the time spent on the action). This
pro-rata amount should be added separately on top of the personnel costs calculated on the
basis of the daily rate.
Example:
6 month into the second reporting period (both RPs of 12 month) of an action, a full-time
employee, having worked a total of 154 day-equivalents on the action, stops being employed and
is entitled to an end-of-contract indemnity of EUR 10 750. The employee has accumulated this
indemnity over 5 years (60 months) of employment. You have determined that 3000€ of this are
attributable to the time of employment during the action (taking into account e.g. changes in
salary, indemnity conditions, working time, etc).
To determine the portion of the indemnity chargeable to the grant, you first divide EUR 3000
indemnity (corresponding to the time of employment during the action) by the maximum
declarable day-equivalents of the person during the action, i.e. {EUR 3000 divided by (215
[maximum declarable day-equivalents RP1] + 107,5 [maximum declarable day-equivalents RP2])
} = EUR 9,30 per declarable day-equivalent.
Then you multiply the indemnity amount per day-equivalent with the day-equivalents actually
worked on the action, i.e. EUR 9,30 x 154 [day-equivalents worked on the action in RP1+RP2] =
EUR 1432,20.
Parental leave (option in HE, HUMA) — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement,
days on parental leave during the reporting period may be deducted for the calculation of the
maximum declarable days and the calculation of the daily rate (i.e. by reducing the maximum
declarable day-equivalents in the formulas by the number of day-equivalents spent on
parental leave). Parental leave is any leave directly related to the birth or adoption of a child.
Other leaves or absences can NOT be deducted, including long-term sick leave, breastfeeding
leave and leave to take care of a sick child. The personnel costs used for the calculation of
the daily rate during the reporting period in which the parental leave takes place, may only
contain costs actually incurred by the beneficiary (e.g. exclude any costs already covered by
a national scheme paying the person on parental leave or reimbursing the beneficiary).
Example:
In a reporting period from 01/12/2021 to 31/01/2023 (14 months), an employee working full-time
on the action takes four months of parental leave after the birth of a child, that is 71,67 day-
equivalents (i.e. {((215/12) x 4 [months on parental leave]) x 1 [working time factor as per
contract]}).
The maximum number of declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period is calculated as
follows: {((215/12) x 14 [months]) x 1} minus 71,67 day-equivalents of parental leave = 179,16,
rounded to 179 maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period.
55EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
You will use this number (179) to calculate the daily rate, i.e. (actual personnel costs during the
reporting period) divided by 179.
Multiple parallel or consecutive contracts — If a person is employed with more than one
employment contract with the beneficiary during the reporting period (where allowed by
applicable law), the beneficiary should calculate a single daily rate. The actual personnel
costs are the sum of the costs of all these employment contracts during the months within
the reporting period. The maximum declarable day-equivalents are the sum of the maximum
declarable day-equivalents calculated individually for each of these employment contracts
during the months within the reporting period.
Contracts without fixed salary/hours — The maximum number of declarable day-
equivalents for employees that do not have a fixed amount of salary and working hours
defined in their contract but only an hourly rate (where allowed by applicable law and not
fitting under other cost categories, e.g. SME owners, subcontracting) can be calculated as
follows:
{((total salary paid to the employee in the reporting period) divided by (hourly rate fixed in the
employment contract)) divided by 8 [default day conversion factor]}
Example: A person does not have a fixed amount of working time and salary set out in the
contract but the contract specifies that the persons earns EUR 10/hour when called to perform a
certain task. Under the contract, you paid the persons EUR 7000 during the reporting period. The
maximum declarable day-equivalents are = EUR 7000 / 10 [hourly rate] / 8 = 87,5 for the
reporting period.
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — Such staff can NOT be charged under this
budget category because contracts with temporary work agencies qualify typically as
purchase of services (unless the temporary work agency carries out directly some task of the
action — in which case it would be considered as subcontracting). Although not eligible as
personnel costs, the costs can be charged under other budget categories (i.e. B.
Subcontracting or C.3 Other goods, works and services), if they comply with the eligibility
conditions (e.g. best value for money and no conflict of interest; see Articles 6.2.B and
6.2.C).
Project-based remuneration (option in HE) — If this option is activated in the Grant
Agreement, the beneficiaries may use this specific calculation method for the daily rate.
Note that for Horizon Europe, there are all in all three different ways how to calculate
the daily rate:
Case 1A: employee whose remuneration is fixed, i.e. same remuneration, regardless
whether they are involved in specific projects or not (actual costs; standard case, see 2.1.4
above)
Case 1B: employees whose remuneration increases through supplementary payments
depending on whether they work in specific projects (actual costs; specific case ‘project-
based remuneration’, this section)
Case 2: beneficiaries declaring personnel costs as unit costs in accordance with their usual
cost accounting practices (unit costs; specific case ‘average personnel costs’, see next
specific case below).
Project-based remuneration (Case 1B) should be used for employees (or equivalent) whose
level of remuneration (daily rate, hourly rate) increases when and because the employee
works in (EU, national or other) projects.
Example: An employee who gets a bonus or a new contract with a higher salary level for working
in a project.
56EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Employees whose salary does not increase when working in projects are covered by
Case 1A (not Case 1B); even when:
− the employment contract was signed explicitly to work in the action or
− the contract covering the work in the action is additional to the main contract with
the employee but has the same remuneration level as the main contract (i.e. same
hourly/daily rate) or
− part of the work in the action was done during overtime and the overtime hours are
paid at a higher rate resulting from national law, collective agreement or
employment contract, provided that such higher rate does not depend on projects.
For project-based remuneration (Case 1B), the daily rate must be calculated as follows:
Step 1 — Calculate the Case 1B action daily rate per person:
{actual personnel costs for work on the action [incl. project-based supplementary
payments, bonuses, increased salary, etc] during the months within the reporting
period}
divided by
{day-equivalents worked by the person on the action during the months within the
reporting period}
For the calculation of the action daily rate you may include the same elements in the
personnel costs as in Case 1A for the daily rate PLUS all bonuses you paid which were
triggered by the participation in the action (even if those bonuses were not based on
objective conditions). Bonuses triggered by the participation of the employee in other
projects must be excluded.
Step 2 — Compare the action daily rate with the national project daily rate, i.e. the
(theoretical) daily rate that you would pay to the person for work in national projects,
in accordance with your usual remuneration practices. The daily rate to be used for
the EU grant financial statement will be the lower of the two. In other words, if the
action daily rate is higher than the national project daily rate, then you will have to
use the national rate for that reporting period.
‘National projects’ are to be understood in the large sense, meaning all types of
projects funded under any type of national (public or private) funding scheme,
including projects co-financed by EU funds that are managed by EU Member States
(e.g. Regional Funds, Agricultural and Fisheries Funds). This must exclude EU grants
as defined in the Grant Agreement, i.e. actions funded by the EU Commission, EU
executive agencies or other funding bodies, which do not qualify as national projects.
The (theoretical) national project daily rate must be calculated the as follows:
{theoretical personnel costs for similar work in a national project over the same number
of months as the reporting period}
divided by
{maximum declarable day-equivalents}
The remuneration to which the person would be entitled to for work in national
projects must be defined:
− either in regulatory requirements (such as national law or collective labour
agreements)
− or in your written internal remuneration rules.
57EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the regulatory requirements or your written internal remuneration rules:
− provide for a bonus range (e.g. between 500 and 1000; between 10% and
50%) or a maximum ceiling (e.g. up to 50) rather than a precise amount per
day or per hour, the remuneration to which the person would be entitled to
(national project daily rate) is the average of the remuneration that the person
received for work in national projects in the complete year before the end of
the reporting period (e.g. calendar, financial or fiscal year depending on the
beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices) for which data is available (see
further below).
Example: If the beneficiary has calculated the action daily rate for a 18 month-
reporting period from 01/09/2021 to 28/02/2023, the average of the remuneration that
the person received for work in national projects could be calculated based on the data
of the complete calendar year 2022 (if available, otherwise of 2021 or the latest
available calendar, financial or fiscal year before 2021).
− provide for different levels of remuneration depending on the staff category,
the remuneration to which the person would be entitled to is the one of the
category to which the person belongs
− provide for different levels of remuneration depending on the type of
nationally-funded projects (and/or the type of work within these projects), the
remuneration to which the person would be entitled to is the one applicable to
the type of project (and/or work) that is closest to the action
− change over the reporting period, the remuneration to which the person would
be entitled to is the one that was applicable for the larger part of that reporting
period.
If there are no regulatory requirements and you do not have internal rules defining
objective conditions on which the national project daily rate can be determined, but
you can demonstrate that your usual practice is to pay bonuses for work in national
projects, the national project daily rate is the average of the remuneration that the
person received in the last complete year (calendar, financial or fiscal year, see
above) before the end of the reporting period for work in national projects calculated
as follows:
{(total personnel costs of the person in the last complete year) minus (remuneration paid
for EU actions during that complete year)}
divided by
{215 minus (days worked in EU actions during that complete year)}
‘EU actions’ are EU grants as defined in the Grant Agreement (i.e. awarded by EU
institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, including EU executive agencies, EU
regulatory agencies, EDA, joint undertakings).
‘Total personnel costs’ covers all types of contracts with the person that qualify
as personnel costs under Article 6.2.A.
If during the last reference period the person worked for the beneficiary only in EU
grants as defined in the Grant Agreement, you must calculate the national project
daily rate using the year before (or the last year in which the person worked in a
national project).
If the person is a new employee hired in the reporting period, their national project
daily rate, calculated according to the formula above, is the one applicable to the
employee whose base salary (salary without bonuses) is the most similar to that
person’s.
58EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Average personnel costs (option in HE, DEP, CEF, EDF, UCPM, HUMA,) — If this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement , beneficiaries who consistently calculate average rates for
their staff as part of their analytical cost accounting system, can use these average rates for
the daily rate.
You can use this method, provided that:
− the daily rate is calculated using the actual personnel costs recorded in your accounts,
excluding any ineligible cost or costs already included in other budget categories (no
double funding of the same costs)
Therefore, you may have to adjust your usual methodology in order to remove:
− costs that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement
Example: The daily rate in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices contains taxes not linked to the remuneration. Those taxes are ineligible and
must be removed when calculating the daily rates for the action.
− costs that are already included in other budget categories
Example: Beneficiaries whose cost accounting practices for personnel costs include
indirect costs. Indirect costs must be removed from the pool of costs used to calculate
the daily rate charged to the action because indirect costs must be declared using a flat
rate. Personnel costs cannot include any indirect costs.
If your usual methodology includes budgeted or estimated elements, we can only
accept those, if they:
− are relevant (i.e. clearly related to personnel costs)
− are used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not play a major role in the calculation)
− correspond to objective and verifiable information (i.e. their basis is clearly
defined and you can show how they were calculated)
Example: Calculating average 2021 daily rates by using 2020 payroll data and
increasing them by adding the CPI (consumer price index) on which the basic salaries
are indexed.
− you apply your cost accounting practices in a consistent manner, based on objective
criteria that must be verifiable if there is a check, review, audit or investigation. You
must do this no matter who is funding the action.
This does not mean that cost accounting practices must be the same for all your
employees, departments or cost centres. If, for example, your usual cost accounting
practices include different calculation methods for permanent personnel and
temporary personnel, this is acceptable. However, you cannot use different methods
for specific actions, projects or persons on an ad-hoc basis.
Example (acceptable): Individual (actual) personnel costs are used for researchers, average
personnel costs (unit costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices) are used for technical support staff.
Example (unacceptable): Average personnel costs are used to calculate costs in externally-
funded projects only.
If your usual cost accounting practice is to calculate hourly rates instead of daily rates, you
must convert the hourly rate into a daily rate as follows:
Daily rate = hourly rate x 8
Alternative: If you have a usual cost accounting practice determining the standard number of
annual productive hours of a full-time employee, you can alternatively multiply by the
number of hours resulting from the following formula (instead of by 8):
59EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
{The higher of: (the standard number of annual productive hours of a full-time employee
according to your practice) OR (90 % of the standard annual workable hours of a full-time
employee)}

General > Article 6.2.A.2, A3 Natural persons with direct contract and seconded persons
A.2 Natural persons with direct contract and seconded persons (all programmes except
SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
A.2 and A.3 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract other than an employment
contract and costs for seconded persons by a third party against payment are also eligible as personnel
costs, if they are assigned to the action, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and:
(a) work under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way the work is
organised, the tasks that are performed and the premises where they are performed) and
(b) the result of the work belongs to the beneficiary (unless agreed otherwise).
They must be calculated on the basis of a rate which corresponds to the costs actually incurred for the direct
contract or secondment and must not be significantly different from those for personnel performing similar
tasks under an employment contract with the beneficiary.
1. Natural persons with direct contract (A.2) and seconded persons (A.3): Types of
costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS,
CUST/FISC), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Costs for natural persons under
direct contract’ or ‘Costs for seconded persons’.
These budget categories cover the costs of two types of persons:
− self-employed natural persons (e.g. some types of in-house consultants) who work on
the action for the beneficiary under conditions similar to those of an employee, but
under a contract that is legally not an employment contract
− persons who are seconded by a third party against payment.
‘Seconded’ means the temporary transfer of an employee from a third party (the employer)
to the beneficiary. Seconded persons are still paid and employed by the third party, but work
for the beneficiary. They are at the disposal of the beneficiary and work under its control and
instructions. A secondment normally requires the seconded person to work at the
beneficiary’s premises, although in specific cases it may be agreed otherwise in the
secondment agreement.
Best practice: The secondment agreement should detail the conditions of secondment (tasks,
reimbursement from one entity to the other, duration of the secondment, location, etc).
What not? Cost of persons who are employees of the beneficiary, (co)owners of the
beneficiary (if the beneficiary is an SME) or staff provided by a temporary work agency.
1.2 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract and persons seconded against
payment must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs of natural persons with direct contract (A.2) and seconded persons (A.3) must
comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.2 and 6.2.A.3, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration by the beneficiary, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− the person must be hired under either:
− a direct contract signed between you and the natural person (not through
another legal entity; e.g. a temporary work agency) or
61EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− a contract signed between you and a legal entity fully owned by that natural
person, and which has no other staff than the natural person being hired or
− a secondment agreement with the employer of the natural person
− the person must work under conditions similar to those of an employee, in particular:
− the beneficiary must organise and supervise the work of the person in a way
similar to that of its employees
Example (acceptable): The beneficiary's project leader and the person discuss
regularly the work to be carried out for the action. The project leader decides the tasks
and timing of the work and instructs the person accordingly.
Example (not acceptable): The beneficiary's project leader and the person meet only
once a month or irregularly, for updates on the state of play of the entrusted work. If
changes are needed, they have to be agreed by the person and may lead to a change of
the amount charged to the beneficiary.
− the person is subject to similar presence requirements as the employees
Examples (acceptable):
1. The person works physically at the beneficiary's premises, following a time schedule
similar to that of the employees (e.g. the beneficiary authorises up to two days of
teleworking per week to its personnel and the person has chosen to benefit from this
regime, i.e. works 2 days in teleworking and 3 days physically at the beneficiary's
premises).
2. The beneficiary does not require any presence at its premises and allows all its
employees to telework full-time from anywhere in the world. The person choses to
telework from home, i.e. the country where the seconding organisation is established.
Examples (not acceptable):
1. The beneficiary applies a consistent policy of only authorising up to two days of
teleworking per week. However, the person works four days per week in teleworking
and only one day at the beneficiary's premises.
2. The beneficiary applies a consistent policy of requiring all staff to work at its
premises. However, the person works from a country other than the one where the
beneficiary is located.
− the remuneration must be based on working time, rather than on delivering
specific outputs/products.
Similar conditions does not mean equal conditions. The working conditions of the
person do NOT have to be exactly the same that those of an employee, but overall
similar.
− the result of the work carried out (including patents or copyright) must in principle
belong to the beneficiary; if (exceptionally) it belongs to the person, the beneficiary
must (just like for employees) obtain the necessary rights from the person (transfer,
licences or other), in order to be able to respect its obligations under the Grant
Agreement
− the cost of the person must not be significantly different from costs for employees of
the beneficiary performing similar tasks; if the beneficiary does not have employees
performing similar tasks, the comparison must be done with national salary references
of the country where the beneficiary is located, for the staff category to which the
person belongs in the sector of activity of the beneficiary and
− the cost must correspond exclusively to the remuneration of the person and related
eligible taxes.
62EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the costs do not fulfil all the conditions indicated here above, they may be eligible as
purchase of services (see Article 6.2.C.3) or subcontracting (see Article 6.2.B) but NOT as
personnel costs.
Thus, for seconded persons, if the resulting daily rate is higher than the daily rate actually
paid by the third party to the seconded person (applying the calculation rules of the Grant
Agreement) the costs can NOT be declared as personnel costs. They may be eligible instead as
purchase of services (see Article 6.2.C.3) or subcontracting (see Article 6.2.B). The reason is that
in this case the payment made by the beneficiary to the third party would be higher than the
actual remuneration of the person, and this implies that there is a commercial margin (or
other non-personnel cost) that is being charged by the third party to the beneficiary.
1.4 Costs of natural persons working under a direct contract and seconded persons against
payment must be calculated as follows:
{amount per unit [daily rate]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate must be calculated as follows:
− if the contract specifies a daily rate: this daily rate must be used; if the contract fixes
an hourly rate instead of a daily rate, you must convert the hourly rate into a daily
rate (daily rate = hourly rate x 8)
− if the contract states a fixed amount for the work and the number of days to be
worked (or hours; in that case 8 hours = 1 day-equivalent): the global amount for the
work must be divided by the number day-equivalents to be worked
− if the contract states a fixed amount for the work, but does not specify the number of
days (or hours) that must be worked: the global amount for the work must be divided
by the pro-rata of 215 annual day-equivalents which corresponds to the duration of
the contract over the reporting period
Example: The contract provides that the person will work at the beneficiary's premises for
assisting in action tasks. The contract is for 6 months starting on 01/01/2021 and ending on
30/06/2021. According to its time records, the person worked 60 day-equivalents in the action
over that period. The contract sets a monthly payment of EUR 3 000 but does not explicitly
establish the number of days/hours to be worked.
Personnel costs for the action = 60 (day-equivalents worked in the action) x daily rate
Daily rate = annual personnel costs / pro-rata of 215 = (3 000 € x 6 months) / (215 x (6
months/12 months)) = 18 000 € / (215 x 0,5) = 18 000 € / 107,5 days = 167,44 €/day
Personnel costs for the action = 60 x 167,44 = 10 046,4€.
Cost elements that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (even if they are part of the
amount stated in the contract) must be removed from the calculation of the personnel cost.
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — If a pro-rata number of 215 annual day-equivalents is used
in the calculation of the amount per unit (daily rate), you must respect the horizontal ceiling (see
Article 6.2.A.1).
Maximum declarable day-equivalents — If a number of day-equivalents (specified directly
in the contract or determined via a pro-rata of 215 day-equivalents) is used in the calculation of
the amount per unit (daily rate), you can NOT declare more day-equivalents worked on the action
than the number of day-equivalents used to calculate the daily rate.
63EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Specific cases (costs for natural persons with direct contract and seconded
personnel (A.2, A.3)):
Persons seconded against payment from a third party located in a different country
than the beneficiary — As salary levels are not homogeneous across different countries,
the remuneration of the person paid by the third party, and so the actual costs paid for the
secondment, might be higher than those paid by the beneficiary for employees performing
similar tasks. In that case, the actual costs paid for the secondment can still be considered
eligible, if the beneficiary can demonstrate that its usual practice is to pay for secondments at
the level of the actual remuneration of the seconded person.
Secondment of staff between beneficiaries/affiliated entities — Is allowed, but it is
the beneficiary/affiliated entity who employs the person who has to declare its costs (NOT the
beneficiary/affiliated to whom the person has been seconded).
Fellowships, scholarships, stipends, internship or similar agreements (not
employees) — Costs for persons (e.g. students, PhDs and other researchers) under
fellowships, scholarships, stipends, internship or similar agreements, through which they
work for the beneficiary on the action (without having an employment contract) can be
accepted, if the agreement is work-oriented (as opposed to training-oriented: i.e. not aimed
at helping the student to acquire professional skills).
Such cost can be charged to the action as personnel costs, if they fulfil the conditions set out
in Article 6.1 and 6.2.A.2, and in particular:
− the assignment of tasks and the remuneration complies with the applicable national
law (e.g. on taxes, labour and social security)
− the recipients of fellowships, scholarships and stipends have the necessary
qualifications to carry out the tasks allocated to them under the action.
PhD agreements are considered work-oriented. However, time for training, if any, may NOT
be charged to the action.
Fellowships, scholarships and stipends, etc. that are not work-oriented are cannot be charged
as personnel costs, but may be eligible as financial support to third parties (FSTP; cost
category D.1), if explicitly allowed by the call conditions and in line with Annex 1 (see Article
6.2.D.1).
Cost for exemptions from academic fees (HE) — The fees (or the fee exemption) are
eligible as personnel cost, if the student contract includes the amount of waived fees as part
of their remuneration. The other conditions set out in Article 6 have to be fulfilled as well
(e.g. the full remuneration, included the value of the waived fees, must be recorded in the
university’s accounts).

[additional OPTION for programmes with SME owner unit cost: A.4 The work of SME owners for the
action (i.e. owners of beneficiaries that are small and medium-sized enterprises20 not receiving a salary) or
natural person beneficiaries (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary) may be
declared as personnel costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.]
20 For the definition, see Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC: micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) are enterprises
- engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of their legal form (including, in particular, self- employed persons and family
businesses engaged in craft or other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity) and
- employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Recommendation) and
which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43
million.
1. SME owners and natural person beneficiaries (A.4): Types of costs — Forms —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS, EUAF,
CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘SME owner/natural
person beneficiary costs’.
This budget category covers the costs of two types of persons:
− Persons who are directly owners or co-owners (regardless of their percentage of
ownership) of the beneficiary, if the beneficiary is an SME and the person is not an
employee of the beneficiary. It applies also to SME owners whose work in the action
for the beneficiary is remunerated via any type of non-employment contract (e.g. a
service contract), via profit distribution or by any remuneration method other than a
salary resulting from an employment contract.
− Beneficiaries who are natural persons; i.e. who signed the Grant Agreement on
her/his own name as individuals, not on behalf of another legal person (e.g. a
company).
‘Directly’ means not owners (or co-owners) through another company owned by them.
What not? SME owners who receive a salary (registered as such in the accounts of the SME)
cannot declare personnel costs under this budget category, unless they can show that this
salary corresponds exclusively to the management of the SME (and is therefore not linked to
the action).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit cost, using the unit cost (daily rate) fixed by the
authorising decision C(2020)71156 and set out in Annex 2a.
6 Commission Decision of 20 October 2020 authorising the use of unit costs for the personnel costs of the owners
of small and medium-sized enterprises and beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary for the
work carried out by themselves under an action or work programme (C(2020)7715).
65EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The amount per unit (daily rate) is prefixed in the authorising decision, adjusted depending
on the country where the beneficiary/affiliated entity is established:
Amount per unit [daily rate] = {EUR 5 080 /18 days [i.e. 282,22]}
multiplied by
{country-specific correction coefficient of the country where the
beneficiary is established}
The country-specific correction coefficient is the one for HE MSCA actions (see Horizon Europe
Work Programme > Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions in force at the time of the call).
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.4, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be declared for an SME owner/natural person beneficiary, who works on the action but
does not receive a salary.
The granting authority may verify that the beneficiary fulfils the conditions for using this unit
cost.
1.4 The costs must be calculated, for the SME owner/natural person, in accordance with the
methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the SME owner/natural person personnel costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed in the authorising decision (see above).
The calculation itself is automated by the IT system. The beneficiary/affiliated entity must
only indicate the number of days worked on the action and the system will then correctly
calculate the personnel costs (based on the parameters described above).
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — For SME owner/natural person beneficiaries unit costs, the
horizontal ceiling (see Article 6.2.A.1) applies not only in case of work on multiple actions, but also
where the person worked in only one EU grant during a given calendar year.

persons who freely work for an organisation, on a non-compulsory basis and without being paid) may be
declared as personnel costs, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.
They:
- may not exceed the maximum amount for volunteers for the action (which corresponds to 50% of the
total (ineligible and eligible) project costs and contributions estimated in the proposal)
- may not exceed the maximum amount for volunteers for each beneficiary set out in Annex 2
- may not make the maximum EU contribution to costs higher than the total eligible costs without
volunteers.
If also indirect costs for volunteers are declared eligible in the call conditions, the amount of indirect costs
may be added to the volunteers costs category in Annex 2, at the flat-rate set out in Point E.]
1. Volunteers (A.5): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (ERDF-TA, LIFE, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV,
JUST, ESF/SOCPL, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM, RELEX), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Volunteers costs’.
This budget category allows to increase the grant amount in order to recognise the
contribution of volunteers in the project, i.e. when persons work for the beneficiary, on a
non-compulsory basis and without being paid.
What not? The unit costs for volunteers work do not cover any actual costs which might be
incurred and paid by the beneficiary, such as insurance, social security, travel or subsistence
costs. Any such costs can be declared and reimbursed separately (if provided for in the call
conditions).
1.2. The work carried out by volunteers can be declared as unit cost, using the unit cost
fixed by the authorising decision C(2019)26467 and set out in Annex 2a.

1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.5, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)).
In addition, a double cap must be applied to limit the amounts declared for volunteers' work
or the amount of the total EU contribution:
− the total EU contribution must be less than the total eligible costs excluding volunteer
work.
− the amounts declared for volunteers work must also not exceed the maximum amount
for volunteers for each beneficiary set out in Annex 2.
1.4. The costs must be calculated, for the volunteer working on the action, in accordance
with the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the volunteer personnel costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate depending on country]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed in the authorising decision (see above).
If a use per hour is necessary, you must convert the daily rate as follows: hourly rate = daily
rate / 8).
68EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If explicitly allowed by the call conditions, you can also add indirect costs to the volunteers
costs.
This calculation is however not automated in the system (i.e. the automatically calculated
indirect costs in cost category E will not include this extra amount). If you want to charge the
indirect costs, you must add them manually to the costs in cost category A.5 Volunteers
costs, on top of the direct volunteers costs (i.e. calculate the indirect volunteers costs:
{indirect cost flat rate x direct volunteers costs} and add this amount to the volunteers costs
in cost category A.5).

A.6 HE Personnel unit cost
[additional OPTION for HE: A.6 For beneficiaries with personnel unit cost, the personnel costs under
categories A.1-A.4 must be declared as unit cost and are eligible, if they fulfil the general eligibility
conditions, are calculated as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a and comply with
the conditions set out in Points A.1-A.4 for the underlying types of costs (personnel).]
1. HE Personnel unit cost (A.6): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for all Horizon Europe types of action which are
mixed actual cost grants (e.g. RIA, CSA, PCP/PPI, COFUND, ERC, EIC, EIT).
This cost category is optional in the sense that it is granted only on request. However,
once the unit cost is approved, it must be used in all HE actions (i.e. new proposals
submitted after the approval date and not yet signed grants under preparation; and
including to calculate personnel costs for lump sum grants in the proposal’s detailed
budget table).
The approved unit cost is valid for at least two years. You may request an update to
the unit cost amount, every two years after the approval date, until 31 December 2027.
The updated unit cost will apply to all the beneficiary’s Horizon Europe and Euratom
proposals that are invited to grant preparation after the new approval date.
You may change your mind ONCE. After the approval you may, if needed, request to
revert back to actual personnel costs (i.e. charging costs under categories A1 to A4), for
all future grants signed after the unit cost is withdrawn (ongoing grants would not be
impacted). Please be aware that if you revert back to actual costs, you will not be able to
request again the use of the personnel unit cost for the rest of the MFF period 2021-2027.
For beneficiaries/affiliated entities that have selected this unit cost, they must (once
approved) charge all their personnel costs under ‘HE Personnel unit cost’.
This budget category replaces categories A1-A4 (A.1 Employees, A.2 Natural persons with
direct contract, A.3 Seconded persons against payment, or A.4 SME owners and natural
person beneficiaries) and covers the cost of all personnel that works on HE actions.
What not? Cost category A.6 can NOT be used to declare costs for personnel with other
kinds of working relationships (e.g. staff provided by a temporary work agency must still be
declared either as purchase of services or subcontracting).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs, using the unit cost (daily rate) approved by
the granting authority in accordance with the HE personnel unit cost authorising decision8 and
set out in Annex 2a.
8 Decision of 15 January 2024 authorising the use of unit costs for personnel costs for actions under the Horizon
Europe and Euratom Programmes.
71EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The precise unit cost (daily rate, i.e. EUR/day) is not prefixed by the authorising decision. It
must be calculated and approved for each beneficiary/affiliated entity organisation in the
Portal Participant Register.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (daily rate) is:
Amount per unit [daily rate] = {total staff costs of the beneficiary in the last closed full financial
year9}
divided by
{annual work units in the last closed full financial year²}
divided by
{215 days}
The result is subject to a maximum cap per country.
{EUR 9 618 multiplied by the corresponding country-specific correction coefficient
divided by
18 days}
The country-specific correction coefficient is the one for HE MSCA actions (see Horizon Europe
Work Programme > Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions in force at the time of the approval).
You can make a test calculation by using the wizard available on the Portal.
In order to formally request the use of the personnel unit cost, the request must be
submitted by the organisation’s legal entity authorised representative (LEAR) through the
Portal (by entering total staff costs in the last closed full financial year, number of annual
work units and country of establishment). It must be supported by an audit certificate
(template to be used) provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent
and complies with Directive 2006/43/EC (or for public bodies: by a competent independent
public officer. The amount approved will be accessible in the Portal Participant Register.
The granting authority may verify that the provided data in the audit certificate match those
in the statutory annual accounts and/or other official documents on which the audit certificate
was delivered (and correct it, if needed).
For more information concerning the unit cost validation procedure, see HE Personnel unit cost
validation procedure.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.6, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b))
− be calculated in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a
− be declared based on the number of day-equivalents for persons working on the action
and
9 At the moment of the request for the unit cost (or the request for its update).
72EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− comply with the specific conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.1-A.4 for the underlying
types of costs. This means that costs can be declared in category A.6 only for
personnel who have a working relationship with the beneficiary/affiliated entity falling
under the categories A.1 Employees, A.2 Natural persons with direct contract, A.3
Seconded persons against payment, or A.4 SME owners and natural person
beneficiaries. Since in HE in-kind contributions are eligible, cost category A.6 may also
be used for seconded persons free-of-charge who have such a working relationship
with a third party (e.g. an employee of a third party seconded free-of-charge to the
beneficiary).
1.4 The costs must be calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the
authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the HE personnel unit costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate approved in the Portal Participant Register]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed by the granting authority in the Participant Register, based on the rate
requested by the beneficiary/affiliated entity (see above).
The calculation itself is automated by the IT system. The beneficiary/affiliated entity must
only indicate the number of days worked on the action and the system will then correctly
calculate the personnel costs (based on the parameters described above)
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — For HE Personnel unit costs, the horizontal ceiling (see Article
6.2.A.1) applies not only in case of work on multiple actions, but also where the person worked in
only one EU grant during a given calendar year.

are calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are
awarded using the beneficiary’s usual purchasing practices — provided these ensure subcontracts with best
value for money (or if appropriate the lowest price) and that there is no conflict of interests (see Article 12).
Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU Directives on public
procurement must also comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.
[additional OPTION for programmes with additional subcontracting rules: [OPTION if selected for the
call21: In addition, if the value of the subcontracts to be awarded exceeds EUR […], the beneficiaries must
comply with the following rules: […].]]
[additional OPTION for programmes with country restrictions for subcontracting costs: [OPTION if
selected for the call: The beneficiaries must ensure that the subcontracted work is performed in the eligible
countries or target countries set out in the call conditions — unless otherwise approved by the granting
authority.]]
[[OPTION if selected for the grant22: Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the action.]]
The tasks to be subcontracted and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1 and the
total estimated costs of subcontracting per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2 (or may be approved ex
post in the periodic report, if the use of subcontracting does not entail changes to the Agreement which would
call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants;
‘simplified approval procedure’).]
21 If the RAO decides to set specific rules, they must be set out in the call and take into account the value of the contracts and the relative
size of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk (proportionality). Specific rules may only be set for the
award of contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000.
22 This is a standard obligation for all EU grants. It may be unselected only for actions where subcontracting is a key/large part of the action
(e.g infrastructure projects; PCP/PPI; technical assistance, statistical programmes, etc).
1. Subcontracting costs (B.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes), beneficiaries/affiliated
entities may charge ‘Subcontracting costs’.
This budget category covers subcontracted action tasks, i.e. contracts for parts of the project
described in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1) that are not implemented by the
beneficiary itself, but by a subcontractor.
78EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Subcontracts are normally wide in scope (implementation of a part of the project, i.e.
action tasks). If a contract covers only individual equipment or consumables that do not
constitute an action task by itself, this will be considered as a purchase (see Article 6.2.C.2
and C.3).
Only limited parts of the action may be subcontracted — unless explicitly allowed in
the call conditions/Grant Agreement. Limited parts means that subcontracting remains
proportionate both in terms of share and type of subcontracted action tasks, as well as in
terms of share in the eligible cost. The acceptable limit is assessed by the granting
authority based on the nature of the action, which may vary between programmes and
calls. For some programmes with large infrastructure projects (e.g. CEF), it is
systematically disactivated.
1.2 Subcontracting costs must be declared as actual costs.
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.B, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− be based either on the best value for money (considering the quality of the service,
good or work proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest price
− not be subject to conflict of interest and
− for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ within the
meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24, 2014/25 and
2009/81)12: comply with the applicable national law on public procurement; these
rules normally provide for special procurement procedures for the types of contracts
they cover.
The beneficiaries can in principle freely choose between best value for money and lowest
price.
Best value for money applies the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial
management) to the subcontracting context.
A competitive selection of subcontractors should be the default approach since it is the safest
way to ensure no conflict of interest, best value for money or lowest price through direct
comparisons between offers. However, subcontracting does not necessarily require
competitive selection procedures to be eligible, provided that, in case of a check, review,
audit or investigation, the beneficiary can prove compliance with best value for money or
lowest price AND no conflict of interest, for instance by showing:
− data from a previous competitive tender on a similar subject that confirms the market
value
− a conducted market consultation, e.g. price quotations, supplier brochures, or
consultation with help of independent experts

79EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− that no suitable offers have been submitted in response to a prior competitive
selection procedure
− that a subcontractor is in a monopoly situation due to technical reasons; or exclusive
(intellectual property) rights; or acquisition of a unique work of art or artistic
performance; or that the task can only be performed by an international organisation
which cannot participate in competitive procedures according to its statutes
− that the subcontractor is the winner of a prior competitive design contest under the
action or a linked action
− a need for special security measures in order to protect the essential interests of the
EU or Member States in accordance with the call conditions.
The beneficiary must be able to demonstrate that the criteria defining quality were clear and
coherent with the purpose.
Best practice: It is recommended to entrust the decision of awarding a contract to an
evaluation committee rather than to a sole person. Members of the evaluation committee
should be aware that they need to disclose the existence of a conflict of interest. The
beneficiary should have clear rules and guidance on situations of conflict of interest. These
rules should provide information on who to contact for advice or disclose the conflict to and,
where necessary, the appropriate action. It is good practice that staff involved in the
procurement process formally signs a declaration of no conflict of interests before performing
their duties.
Subcontracts (tasks to be subcontracted and estimated costs; not necessarily the
subcontractor, especially if not yet known) must be justified in Annex 1 (simplified approval
procedure allowed; see below).
1.4 Regarding the calculation, the amount charged as eligible cost must correspond to the
amount invoiced by the subcontractor.
Specific cases (subcontracting costs (B.)):
Simplified approval procedure (new subcontracts) — If the need for a subcontract was
not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to
introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report (simplified approval
procedure). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting
authority might not approve the new subcontract and reject the costs at interim or final
payment-stage later on.
Subcontracting in actions affecting security or public order (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF) —
If provided for in the call conditions, the simplified approval procedure is NOT allowed and
specific participation conditions and cost eligibility criteria may apply to subcontracting in
actions that concern essential interest of the EU and its Member States.
Subcontracting of action tasks involving classified information — Action tasks
involving EU classified information may ONLY be subcontracted (cumulative conditions):
− to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission) and
− if the granting authority has explicitly approved such requests in writing (see Article
13.2 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
80EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Coordination tasks of the coordinator (e.g. distribution of funds, review of reports and
other tasks listed in Article 7) — Can NOT be subcontracted (they can only be delegated,
under certain circumstances, to an entity with ‘authorisation to administer’ or in the case of
‘sole beneficiaries’ within the meaning of Article 190(2) of the Financial Regulation
2024/250913; see Article 7).
Subcontracting to beneficiaries — Is NOT allowed in the same grant. All beneficiaries
contribute to and are interested in the action; if one beneficiary needs the services of another
in order to perform its part of the work it is the second beneficiary who should declare its
own costs for that work.
Subcontracting to affiliates — Is normally NOT allowed in the same grant. As for
subcontracting between beneficiaries (see above), affiliated entities participating in the action
should declare instead their own cost for that work. Subcontracting to affiliated entities not
participating in the action is possible only exceptionally e.g. in case of monopoly or where
they have a framework contract (affiliate is their usual provider). The subcontracting still
needs to comply with the general and specific cost eligibility conditions, in particular ensure
best value for money or lowest price and avoid any conflict of interest. As best practice, these
affiliates should rather be added to the action, be identified as affiliated entities under Article
8 and declare their own costs for that work.
Subcontracting to associated partners or third parties giving in-kind contributions
— Exceptionally possible, e.g. in case of monopoly or where they have a framework contract
(the associated partner or third party giving in-kind contributions is their usual provider) and
provided that the Annex 1 DoA explains clearly what tasks the participant will perform as
associated partner, or contribute to as third party giving in-kind contributions and what tasks
will be performed as subcontractor (the latter remaining the responsibility of the
subcontracting beneficiary). The subcontracting needs to comply with the general and specific
eligibility conditions, in particular ensure best value for money or lowest price and avoid any
conflict of interest.
Framework contracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if this is
the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of service). In order to be eligible, the
framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money or
lowest price and absence of conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily
have to be concluded before the start of the action.

1. Purchase costs (C.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Purchase costs’.
This budget category covers, depending on the options that apply, the following sub-
categories:
− Travel, accommodation and subsistence (see Article 6.2.C.1)
− Equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2)
− Other goods, works or services, if necessary to implement the action (see Article
6.2.C.3).
Purchase contracts are normally limited in scope. If a contract covers the
implementation of action tasks, this will be considered as a case of subcontracting (see
Article 6.2.B).
1.2 Depending on the provisions in the Grant Agreement, purchase costs must be declared
as actual costs or unit cost (unit cost is provided for travel and subsistence costs for instance
in EMFAF, IMCAP, SMP, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV, JUST, ESF/SOCPL, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, TSI, UCPM).
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred/units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a) and (b))
82EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− be based either on the best value for money (considering the quality of the service,
good or work proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest price
− not be subject to conflict of interest and
− for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ within the
meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24, 2014/25 and
2009/81)14: comply with the applicable national law on public procurement; these
rules normally provide for special procurement procedures for the types of contracts
they cover.
The beneficiaries can in principle freely choose between best value for money and lowest
price.
Best value for money applies the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial
management) to the purchasing context. It does NOT necessarily require competitive
selection procedures. However, if a beneficiary did not request several offers, it must — in
case of a check, review, audit or investigation — be able to show that the price was market-
value and that the criteria defining quality were clear and coherent with the purposes of the
purchase (for detailed guidance, see cost category 6.2.B above).
Selecting the lowest price may be appropriate for automatic award procedures where the
contract is awarded to the company that meets the conditions and quotes the lowest price
(e.g. electronic tendering for consumables).
1.4 The calculation method depends on the type of cost (depreciation, actual or unit cost;
see below).
Specific cases (purchase costs (C.)):
Purchases between participants — Are in principle not accepted. If a beneficiary needs
supplies from another beneficiary, it is the latter beneficiary that should charge them to the
action as cost. (Otherwise there is the risk that the grant is used to charge commercial profit
margins.) Purchases between participants will only be accepted in exceptional and properly
justified cases. For detailed explanations, see the specific cases in Article 6.2.B on
subcontracting between different types of participants.
Framework contracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if this is
the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of goods). In order to be eligible, the
framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money or
lowest price and absence of conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily
have to be concluded before the start of the action.
Providers of research infrastructures services for transnational and virtual access of
users (HE) — The reimbursement of their costs by the beneficiaries will be considered as a
specific purchase of services which will be specified in Annex 1. If (e.g. due to the applicable
national law) an entity providing research infrastructure services cannot issue an invoice to a
beneficiary, but is paid or reimbursed via any other form of transaction, this can be
assimilated to an invoice and accepted as eligible purchase costs.

Best value for money can be assured if the providers do not make a profit and their access
costs are calculated according to a well-defined methodology. To this extent, sufficient details
must be provided, such as name of the service providers, purchase costs and object, as well
as the explanation why these service providers are needed and why the purchase costs of the
services are appropriate.
Example: Beneficiaries can explain why these providers of scientific services are necessary for the
action, confirm that they will not include any profit margin when being reimbursed by the
beneficiaries; that they will bear part of the access costs to the research infrastructure (because
some of their costs will not be reimbursed like depreciation costs of their equipments).
Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the granting authority, if they intend to amend the
grant to change a specific purchase of service assessed during proposal evaluation or to
introduce a new specific purchase of service during the action implementation.

C.1 Travel and subsistence
[OPTION 1 for programmes without travel and subsistence costs (ineligible):
Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with travel and subsistence costs:
Purchases for travel, accommodation and subsistence must be calculated as follows:
- travel: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line with the
beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]
- accommodation: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line
with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]
- subsistence: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line with
the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]. ]
1. Travel and subsistence costs (actual costs) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the actual cost option (HE, DEP, EDF,
CEF, LIFE, AGRIP, HUMA, RELEX), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Travel and
subsistence costs’ as actual costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘actual costs’ (NOT ‘unit or actual costs’;
see Data Sheet, Point 3).
This budget category covers travels and related accommodation and subsistence allowances
needed for the action. For some programmes, it is specifically broken down in the following
sub-categories:
− Travel
− Accommodation
− Subsistence.
1.2 If the actual costs option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the costs must be
declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.1, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a)) and
− be in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel.
85EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The travels for which costs are claimed must be necessary for the action (e.g. to present a
paper explaining the results at a conference). Travel costs related to an event at which the
beneficiary carried out work that was not specifically related to the action are NOT eligible.
All travel costs must be limited to the needs of the action; costs related to extensions (for
other professional or private reasons) are NOT eligible.
Moreover, they must be adequately recorded.
Costs for breakfast for an overnight stay (if not included in the cost of the hotel room) can be
charged (as subsistence costs) to the action if it is the beneficiary’s normal practice to
reimburse them.
Costs of a combined travel (i.e. where the end point of travel is different from the start) can
be charged to the action ONLY up to the cost that would have been incurred if the travel
would have been made exclusively for the action (i.e. up to the theoretical cost of travelling
directly back to the start point) AND if:
− it is the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay for such travels (e.g. travels combining
professional and personal reasons)
− it has been an actual cost for the beneficiary.
Record-keeping — In the case of combined travel, the beneficiary must keep records of
not only the actual cost of the subsequent travel leg(s), but also of the theoretical direct
return travel after the end of the work for the action in order to prove the cost that would
have been incurred.
If the beneficiary reimburses travel and/or subsistence allowances as a per diem payment, it
is the per diem amount that is considered an eligible cost, NOT the actual prices paid by the
person receiving the per diem. (For the purposes of the grant, these per diem costs remain
actual costs, NOT simplified forms such as unit costs). They must be recorded in the
beneficiary’s accounts and will be checked if there is an audit.
1.4 There is no specific calculation method; the costs must correspond to the eligible costs
actually incurred (amounts paid for the travel, accommodation and subsistence).
Best practice: Beneficiaries that have special/atypical/particularly expensive travel plans
should contact the granting authority for advice.
Record-keeping — In terms of record-keeping, the beneficiary must keep evidence of the
actual costs incurred as well as evidence that the instance of travel fulfils the general eligibility
conditions for actual costs (for example that the travel was linked to the action).
2. Travel and subsistence costs (unit costs) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
2.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the unit cost option (most
programmes, e.g. I3, ERDF-TA, IMREG, EMFAF, IMCAP, SMP, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV, JUST,
ESF/SOCPL, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, EUAF, CUST/FISC, PERI (partial), TSI, UCPM), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Travel and subsistence costs’ as unit costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘unit or actual costs’ (NOT ‘actual
costs’; see Data Sheet, Point 3).
86EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This budget category covers travels needed for the action, broken down in the following sub-
categories:
− Travel
− Accommodation
− Subsistence.
2.2 If the unit cost option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the costs must be declared
using the unit cost fixed by the authorising decision C(2021)3515 and set out in Annex 2a.
Which unit cost? Check the opening date of your call — the unit costs that you must use
for your grant will always depend on the date on which the call for proposals was opened.
Land travel’ means:
- for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: trips between 50 and 399 km by any
form of land-based travel (bus, rail or car) and trips above 400km by rail
- for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: trips between 50 and 399 km by any
form of land-based travel, and trips between 400 and 600 km by rail.
Travel below 50km will not be reimbursed using the travel unit costs. Such costs can be
reimbursed using actual costs, if it is the usual practice of the beneficiary to reimburse such
short-distance travel.
If a particular instance of travel, accommodation or subsistence in the action is not covered
by one of the unit costs mentioned in the authorising decision C(2021)35, actual costs may
be used (in same way as ‘Travel and subsistence as actual costs’ above).
In practice, this is usually the case for:
− travel between 50 and 399km in a non-EU country
− travel between 50 and 399km between a Member State and a non-EU country (except
for land-based travel between Member States and bordering countries for calls with
opening date as from 31 July 2024)
− land travel between 50 and 399km in LU, CY or MT
− ferry or boat travel from island to island or island to mainland
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: land travel above 400 km or above
600 km where specific unit costs for distances between 400 and 600 km are provided
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: journeys less than 400 km which
necessitate air travel because land travel is not possible or appropriate (see specific
case below).
The amounts per unit are prefixed by the authorising decision.
2.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.1, in
particular:
15 Commission Decision of 12 January 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for travel, accommodation and
subsistence costs under an action or work programme under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework
(C(2021)35) as amended by Commission Decision C(2023)4928 of 26.07.2023.
87EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be purchased for the action and in accordance with Article 6.2.C.
2.4 The costs must be calculated, for each travel and person travelling, in accordance with
the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
Regarding travel:
The formulas for calculating the travel are:
- for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024:
− by air above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x number of journeys}
− by rail above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x number of journeys}
− combined air and rail above 400 km: {amount depending on distance band x number of
journeys}
− land travel (50 – 399km) in 1 Member State: {amount for intra-Member State x number of
journeys}
− land travel (50-399km) between 2 Member States: {amount for inter-Member State travel
x number of journeys}
− travel between EU and one of EU’s outermost regions and overseas countries and territories
(OCTs)5: {specific unit cost for that OCT x number of journeys}
− journey of less than 400 km not covered by land transport (e.g. Helsinki/Tallinn): {unit
cost for air travel (400-600 km) x number of journeys}
− travel to/from places more than 400 km from a primary airport (e.g. certain regions in
Finland): {relevant unit cost for air travel x 150% number of journeys}
- for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024:
– by air or combined air and rail above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x
number of journeys}
– land travel in 1 Member State (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600k where relevant): {amount for
intra-Member State x number of journeys}
– land travel between 2 Member States (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600k where relevant):
{amount for inter-Member State travel x number of journeys}
– land travel between a Member State and a bordering country (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600
km where relevant): {amount for Member State and specific connection x number of
journeys}
All unit costs are an amount to cover a return trip. However, the calculation of the distance
should be done on the basis of the 1-way distance between the points.
For calculating the ‘distance’ between two points for land or air travel, beneficiaries must
use the distance calculators available on the Europa website.
88EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Enter start and end points of your travel. Do NOT enter intermediate stops, transfer
locations etc.
The distance calculators are mandatory. The distance produced by the calculators is the
only distance that can be used for the calculation of the unit costs — even if this does not
correspond to the actual distance of the travel.
Example: For example, the land travel calculator defines the distance between towns A and B as 380
km. However, because the train line deviates slightly to also serve town C, the actual distance travelled
is 410 km. For the purposes of the unit cost, only the distance of 380 km between towns A and B is
relevant (as calculated by the distance calculator).
The start and end-points entered will normally be the place of employment of the person and
the location of the meeting.
If, following the event, the person will travel to a place other than the start point, the amount
to be declared will be the theoretical cost of returning to the same starting point, unless the
different destination is necessary for the implementation of the action. In that case, the unit
cost can be calculated using the longer of the distances (e.g. if travel from Dublin – Brussels
– Athens is justified for the action, the unit cost to be applied can be calculated on basis of
the longer flight from Brussels – Athens).
Where the trip involves 3 journeys and is necessary for the implementation of the action (e.g.
Madrid – Brussels – Berlin – Madrid), the unit costs can be calculated on the basis of 2
separate return flights: Madrid – Brussels and Berlin – Madrid.
For checking the distance of travel to/from places more than 400km from a primary airport,
the following are the ‘primary airports’ to be used (— only relevant for calls with opening
date before 31 July 2024; for calls as from 31 July 2024, primary airports are no longer
relevant and instead the amount is determined solely by calculating the distance in the
normal way using the distance calculator):

Regarding accommodation:
The formula for calculating the accommodation is:
{amount per unit [depending on country]}
multiplied by
{nights spent on travel}
For the EU’s outermost regions or OCTs, the rate for the relevant Member State can be used
as a proxy amount (— only relevant for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024; for calls
with opening date as from 31 July 2024, specific unit costs for each OCT apply).
90EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, bear in mind that a new and extended list of
countries has been published in Annex 2a, and that this list contains a number of countries that
were not included in the list for previous calls.
Moreover, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is a specific unit cost for
’other countries’ that are not specifically mentioned in the list. Therefore, in practice there is now
a relevant unit cost to reimburse accommodation costs for any country in the world.
Regarding subsistence:
The formula for calculating the subsistence is:
{amount per unit [depending on country]}
multiplied by
{days spent on travel}
Subsistence unit costs are for a 24-hour period. The amount of unit costs to be declared
should be calculated by rounding up or down to the nearest full number of days, except for
the first day where any amount of hours will be rounded up to 1 full day.
For the EU’s outermost regions or OCTs, the rate for the relevant Member State can be used
as a proxy amount (— only relevant for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024; for calls
with opening date as from 31 July 2024, specific unit costs for each OCT apply).
The subsistence unit costs is intended to cover meals and other incidental expenses.
However, it is not necessary to verify whether the person already received a meal free of cost
(for example, a meal provided by the meeting/conference organiser or breakfast included in
the associated hotel amount; this does not impact the amount paid for the subsistence unit
cost).
For calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, bear in mind that a new and extended list of
countries has been published in Annex 2a, and that this list contains a number of countries that
were not included in the list for previous calls.
Moreover, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is a specific unit cost for
’other countries’ that are not specifically mentioned in the list. Therefore, in practice there is now
a relevant unit cost to reimburse subsistence costs for any country in the world.
Record-keeping — As regards record-keeping, the beneficiaries will have to be able to
prove (upon request) that an instance of travel took place and was linked to the action. The
beneficiaries do not need to keep specific records on the actual costs incurred, but must keep
adequate records and supporting documents to prove the number of units declared (see Article
20).
Example: Documents with a dated attendance list and description of the meeting can demonstrate that the
travel took place, was necessary for the action and occurred during the action duration. To be able to identify
the unit cost of each travel, the beneficiary could indicate on the attendance list the place of departure of the
persons for whom travel costs are claimed. In case of an event with no attendance list (a smaller/informal
meeting or event organised by a third party), the beneficiary must keep evidence to demonstrate that the
person travelled and that it was linked to the action: the agenda, email invitation, the minutes or report of
the event, the boarding pass, travel ticket, etc.
Specific cases (Travel and subsistence (C.1)):
Travel and subsistence for persons other than personnel (e.g. conference speakers,
visiting experts) (actual or unit cost) — Travel and subsistence costs may also be eligible
for persons that participate in the action on an ad-hoc basis (e.g. attending specific
91EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
meetings), if this complies with the general and specific eligibility conditions in Article 6.1 and
6.2.C, in particular being necessary for the implementation of the action, and:
− their participation is foreseen in Annex 1, or
− their participation is specifically justified in the periodic technical report and approved
by the granting authority (simplified approval procedure).
In line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel, the beneficiary may purchase itself or
reimburse these persons.
Carbon-offsetting (actual cost only) — Costs associated with carbon offsetting measures
can be eligible if they are in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel (not just for
the EU action) and fulfil the general and specific cost eligibility conditions (e.g. incurred
during the action duration, in connection with the action as described in Annex 1 and the
underlying travel is necessary for the action’s implementation).
Air travel below 400 km (unit cost only) — Air travel below 400km is in principle not
reimbursed (participants are expected to use land travel for such distances and can charge
such land travel costs).
However, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is some flexibility to
reimburse air travel below 400km on the basis of actual costs incurred where land travel
would be not possible or appropriate. This may, for instance, be the case:
- where land travel is not available for a particular route (for example, travel from an
island to another island or from an island to the mainland)
- where land travel would involve an unusually long length of time (for example, an
anticipated journey time of seven hours or more (‘door to door’) for a one-way trip of
less than 399 km if there is a direct route by air travel as an alternative)
- where land travel is normally available but, due to unforeseen events, not available at
the time (for example, works on a train line meaning the train connection is cancelled;
proof of such circumstances should be kept on file).
Best practice: Beneficiaries who have queries in specific cases should contact the granting
authority (ideally before the travel is undertaken, but at the very latest before the costs are
submitted at the end of a reporting period). Costs for air travel for distances below 400 km
which have not been agreed with the granting authority may be rejected or adjusted to the
equivalent costs for land travel.
Travel by car (unit cost only) — Car travel below 50 km is NEVER eligible for
reimbursement using unit costs. However, it could be reimbursed using costs actually
incurred, where this is in line with the usual practices of the beneficiary.
For distances between 50 and 399 km, travel by car can be reimbursed as a form of land
travel (i.e. using the applicable ‘land travel’ unit costs).
For travel above 400 km, the situation depends on the call opening date:
− for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: car travel can NOT be reimbursed
using unit costs, but could be reimbursed on the basis of costs actually incurred,
where this is in line with the usual practices of the beneficiary
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: reimbursement of car travel above
400km using unit costs is possible where the travel took place in one of the land travel
connections for land travel between 50 and 399 km covered by authorising decision
C(2021)35; if there is no such land travel connection, then costs can be reimbursed
using costs actually incurred, where in line with and allowed by the beneficiaries usual
practices.
92EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
No matter the actual distance travelled, the reimbursement is limited to the unit cost for
land travel between 50 and 399 km.
Example: For example, a person drives from Frankfurt in Germany to Bern in Switzerland – a distance
of 420 km. Since there are unit costs for distances of 50 – 399 km for land travel between Germany and
Switzerland, this travel can be reimbursed with a unit cost amount of EUR 66. If the connection by car is
not covered by authorising decision C(2021)35, then costs can be reimbursed using costs actually
incurred, where in line with and allowed by the beneficiaries usual practices.
Destinations with different distances in the flight- and land travel calculators (e.g.
the flight calculator shows a distance below 400 km but the land travel calculator shows a
distance of more than 400km) (unit cost only) — In the unit cost system, reimbursement of
air travel is only possible where the travel is more than 400km, as calculated by the flight
calculator. Therefore, if the flight calculator shows a distance of 390 km, the travel costs can
NOT be reimbursed using the air travel unit costs.
Instead, the amounts to be claimed for this travel should be calculated according to the rules
for land travel. Thus, if for instance the land travel calculator shows a distance of 440 km, the
travel must be reimbursed using the relevant rules for land-based travel, i.e.:
− for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: using the unit costs set out in Annex
2a for air, rail or combined air/rail (see table ’for travel of 400 km or more (air or rail
or combined air/rail)’)
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: using unit costs if there is a
corresponding unit cost for that travel (for example, land travel of 400 – 600 km
within France, or between Belgium and France, or between Germany and
Switzerland); if there is no applicable unit cost for that travel, then it can be
reimbursed on the basis of costs actually incurred.

1. Equipment costs (depreciation costs) (C.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility
conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the depreciation option (default option
for most programmes), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Equipment costs’ as
depreciation costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘depreciation only’ (NOT ‘depreciation
and full cost for listed equipment’ or ‘full cost and depreciation for listed equipment’; see
Data Sheet, Point 3). For those other options, see specific cases below.
In this case, this budget category covers the depreciation costs of equipment, infrastructure
or other assets used for the action. In addition, in some cases (e.g. infrastructure), it may
also include the costs necessary to ensure that the asset is ready for its intended use (e.g.
site preparation, delivery and handling, installation, etc).
What not? If the beneficiary’s usual practice is to consider durable equipment costs (or
some of them) as indirect costs, these can NOT be declared as direct costs, but are covered
by the flat rate for indirect costs (see Article 6.2.E). Any depreciation declared as a direct
cost under the action must be a direct cost under the beneficiary’s cost accounting practices
(see Article 6.2).
1.2 The costs must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.2, in
particular:
97EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts,
etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C and
− be written off in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual accounting practices and with
international accounting standards.
‘International accounting standards’ are an internationally recognised set of rules for
maintaining books and reporting company accounts, designed to be compared and
understood across countries.
Example: The IAS 16 (International Accounting Standards) or the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), originally created by the EU and now in common international use.
1.4 They must be calculated according to the following principles:
− the depreciable amount (purchase price) of the equipment must be allocated on a
systematic basis over its useful life (i.e. the period during which the equipment is
expected to be usable). If the equipment’s useful life is more than a year, the
beneficiary can NOT charge the total cost of the item in a single year
‘Useful life’ means the time during which the equipment is useful for the beneficiary. If
the beneficiary does not normally calculate depreciation, it may refer to its national
tax regulations to define the useful life of the equipment.
Declaring the full price in one single year would be considered either as not compliant
with the international accounting standards or as an excessive cost — and therefore in
both cases ineligible; see specific case ‘cash-based accounting’ below), except in case of
low-value assets (see below).
− depreciated equipment costs can NOT exceed the equipment’s purchase price
− if the beneficiary does not use the equipment exclusively for the action, only the
portion used on the action may be charged (the amount of use must be auditable)
Example:
A large 3D printer was bought before the action started and was not fully depreciated. For 6
months in reporting period 1 it was used for the action for 50 % of the time and for other
activities for the other 50 % of the time. Linear depreciation is applied according to the
beneficiary’s usual practices (depreciation over the expected period of use of the 3D printer):
EUR 100 000 per year (EUR 50 000 for 6 months).
Costs declared for the project: EUR 50 000 (6 months of use) multiplied by 50 % of use for the
action during those 6 months = EUR 25 000.
− the beneficiary can charge depreciation in line with applicable audit standards and its
usual accounting practices, i.e. normally at the earliest for periods as of the reception
of the equipment and its availability for use (i.e. when it is in the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management).
Example: A robot-supported equipment was bought on 15 November and received and set up
for use as of 01 December. The reporting period ends on 31 December and the financial year
also ends on 31 December. The maximum depreciation that the beneficiary may charge is 1
month (from 1 to 31 December); i.e. 1/12 of the annual depreciation. This applies even if the
beneficiary recorded in its accounts at 31 December a full year of depreciation for the item.
The depreciation costs must be calculated for each reporting period.
2. Equipment costs (full cost) (C.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
98EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the full cost option (sometimes in HE,
RFCS, DEP, EDF, SMP, EU4H, EUAF, UCPM, RELEX; always in CEF, CCEI, HUMA), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Equipment costs’ as full costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘full cost only’ (NOT ‘depreciation and
full cost for listed equipment’ or ‘full cost and depreciation for listed equipment’; see Data
Sheet, Point 3). For those other options, see specific cases below.
Equipment that does not comply with the specific conditions for full cost (e.g. equipment
purchased prior to the action but used for the action) must be declared using the normal
depreciation cost.
In this case, the equipment costs cover the full capitalised costs for the equipment,
infrastructure or other assets to the grant.
‘Capitalised’ costs means recorded as assets in the beneficiary’s balance sheet. They may
relate to:
− the full purchase costs and/or
− the full development costs
and must be recorded under a fixed asset account in the beneficiary’s accounting records in
compliance with international accounting standards and the beneficiary’s usual cost
accounting practices.
2.2 The costs must be declared as actual costs.
2.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.2, in
particular:
− for full purchase costs:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts,
etc; see Article 6.1(a)) and
− have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C
Example: A beneficiary needs to buy an off-the-shelf equipment to perform some of its action
tasks. The related purchase costs are eligible if they comply with Article 6.2.C (i.e. ‘best value
for money/or lowest price’ and ‘no conflict of interests’ principles).
− for full development costs:
− depending on the nature of the cost items included in the development cost, fulfil the
general and specific cost eligibility conditions that would apply to the individual cost
item (for example, have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C or fulfil the
specific conditions for personnel costs to be eligible Article 6.2.A).
Example:
A beneficiary is developing a prototype as part of its action tasks. For this purpose, it needs to
buy several components and rely on a service provider to assemble some specific parts of the
prototype. In that case, the related purchase costs are eligible if they comply with Article 6.2.C
(i.e. notably with the ‘best value for money/ or lowest price’ and ‘no conflict of interests’
principles).
The beneficiary has also its own employees involved in the assembling of the other parts of the
prototype. In that case, the related personnel costs are eligible if they comply with Article
6.2.A.1 (personnel costs for employees or equivalent appointing act).
2.4 They must be calculated according to the following principles:
99EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− correspond to the actual costs incurred in the purchase or for the development and
− ensure that there is no double charging of costs (in particular, no charging of
depreciation costs for the prototype or pilot plant to the grant or another EU grant).
They cover the full purchase/development costs (not only the depreciation costs for the
reporting period).
Specific cases (equipment costs (C.2)):
Depreciation and full costs for listed items (option in HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, SMP,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI, PERI, UCPM, RELEX) — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement,
the beneficiaries can use depreciation for all items, except certain items listed in the Grant
Agreement for which you can charge full cost. For details, see above.
Full costs and depreciation for listed items (option in HE, RFCS, EDF, LIFE, SMP, UCPM)
— If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries may charge all items at
full cost, except the ones listed in the Grant Agreement for which you need to use
depreciation. For details, see above.
Full price of a low-value asset in one single year (depreciation) — If the option for
depreciation is activated, full cost of a low-value asset may exceptionally be eligible in the
year when it is purchased if:
− the full cost is recorded in the accounts of the entity in accordance with its usual
accounting practices as expenditure of that year (i.e. NOT recorded as an asset
subject to depreciation)
− the cost of the asset is below the low-value ceiling as defined under national law (e.g.
national tax legislation) or other objective reference compatible with the materiality
principle
and
− the item is used exclusively for the action in the year of purchase.
If the item is not used exclusively for the action in the year of purchase, only the portion
used on the action may be charged.
Equipment bought before the action starting date (depreciation) — If the option for
depreciation is activated, depreciation costs for equipment used for the action, but bought
before the action starting date are eligible if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions of
Article 6.1(a). The remaining depreciation costs (the equipment has not been fully
depreciated before the action’s start) may be eligible for the portion corresponding to the
action duration and to the rate of actual use for the purposes of the action.
Example: According to the beneficiary’s accounting practices, a piece of equipment bought in
January 2020 has a depreciation period of 48 months. If the action starts in January 2022 (when
24 months of depreciation have already passed) and the equipment is used for this action, the
beneficiary can declare the depreciation costs incurred for the remaining 24 months, in proportion
to the equipment’s use for the action.
Cash-based accounting — There are NO exceptions for cash-based accounting. If the
option for depreciation is activated, also beneficiaries with cash-based accounting may only
charge the annual depreciation costs that correspond to the part of the equipment’s use for
the action.They can NOT charge the full price in one single year — even if their usual
accounting practice is to record the equipment’s total purchase costs as an expense in one
year.
Example:
A beneficiary that uses cash-based accounting buys a machine for EUR 100 000 in March 2021.
According to the logbook of the machine, it is used for the action 50 % of the time from 1 July 2021
100EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
until the end of the action. The action started in January 2021 and runs for three years with two
reporting periods. The machine’s useful life is six years.
In the reporting period ending in June 2022, the beneficiary must declare depreciation costs taking
into account the percentage of use, the time used for the action and the machine’s useful life:
EUR 100 000 x (12/72 months) x 50 % (used for the action) = amount declared for the machine
in the first reporting period
In the reporting period ending in December 2023, the beneficiary must declare:
EUR 100 000 x (18/72 months) x 50 % (used for the action) = amount declared for the machine
in the second reporting period
Costs of renting or leasing of equipment, infrastructure or other assets
(depreciation and full cost) — If the equipment was not purchased but rented or leased,
the beneficiaries can charge the renting or leasing costs (i.e. finance leasing, renting and
operational leasing) — both if the option for depreciation or the full cost option are activated,
The costs must comply with the general and specific eligibility conditions (see Article 6.1(a)
and Article 6.2.C). The costs must be calculated according to the following principles :
− they must correspond to the actual eligible costs incurred for the renting or leasing
− they must not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment, infrastructure or
assets
− they must not include any financing fees (e.g. finance charges included in the finance
lease payments or interests on loans taken to finance the purchase)
− there must be no double charging of costs (e.g. no charging of depreciation costs for
equipment previously funded at full cost by an EU grant)
− where the Grant Agreement provides for depreciation: if equipment is not used
exclusively for the action, only the portion used on the action may be charged (the
amount of use must be auditable)
− where the Grant Agreement provides for full cost: in principle the full rental or lease
cost can be charged, irrespective of the portion used on the action. However, the cost
still cannot exceed depreciation costs of similar equipment/infrastructure/assets that
need to be determined based on the duration of the action (i.e. if you enter into a 5-
year lease at the start of a 3-year action, you may only charge cost up to the amount
of depreciation for three years).

[OPTION 1 for programmes without costs for other goods, works and services (ineligible):
Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with costs for other goods, works and services (standard):
Purchases of other goods, works and services must be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred.
Such goods, works and services include, for instance, consumables and supplies, promotion, dissemination,
protection of results, translations, publications, certificates and financial guarantees, if required under the
Agreement. ]
1. Costs of other goods, works and services (C.3): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge other purchases as ‘Other goods, works and
services’.
This budget category covers the costs for goods and services that were purchased for the
action, such as:
− costs for consumables and supplies (e.g. raw materials, office supplies)
− communication and dissemination costs (e.g. translation and printing costs or graphic
designer fees for printed products such as leaflets or other promotional items in
relation to communication activities; conference fees; costs for speakers and
interpreters)
− costs related to intellectual property rights (IPR) (e.g. costs related to protecting the
results such as consulting fees or fees paid to patent offices)
− costs for certificates on financial statements (CFS) and certificates on methodology
(CoMUC; where necessary)
− costs for financial guarantees (only if required by the granting authority; see Data
Sheet, Point 4.2).
Best practice: If there is any doubt about whether a cost is eligible, or whether a cost is to be
considered a purchase cost for other goods, works and services, the beneficiaries should
contact the granting authority.
What not? If it is the beneficiary’s usual accounting practice to consider some of these costs
(or all of them) as indirect costs, they cannot be declared as direct costs.
1.2 Costs of other goods, works and services must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.3, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a)) and
102EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− be purchased specifically for the action and in accordance with Article 6.2.C.
1.4. Regarding the calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible costs actually
incurred (i.e. the amount paid by the beneficiary for the supply of the goods, works or
services).
Specific cases (costs for other goods, works and services (D.3)):
Supplies in stock — Supplies and consumables which were already in the stock of the
beneficiary may be eligible as a direct cost, if they are used for the action and fit the
definition of direct costs under Article 6.2.
Self-produced consumables with an accounting value in the inventory of the
beneficiary (i.e. not internally invoiced costs for goods and services) — Consumables that
are manufactured (produced) by the beneficiary itself do not have a purchase price; the cost
of production for the beneficiary is however normally recorded in the accounts of the
beneficiary (as part of the inventory). Therefore, the eligible costs of self-produced
consumables must be determined on the basis of its accounting value under the following
conditions:
− only the direct costs within the accounting value of the consumable (cost of
production) may be charged
and
− the amount resulting from the indent above may not be significantly higher than the
market price of the consumable.
Beneficiaries can NOT charge the commercial price of their self-produced consumables,
since it is not allowed to include a profit.
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — Costs for staff provided by a temporary
work agency are eligible normally under category C.3 Other goods and services if they
comply with the eligibility conditions (and unless the temporary work agency carries out
directly some task of the action, in which case it can be considered as subcontracting and
should be declared under category B. Subcontracting).
Communication and dissemination plans — The eligibility of costs for communication and
dissemination plans (e.g. HE plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results) depends
on their timing. Costs for the drawing up of plans that must be submitted together with the
proposal are normally NOT eligible since they will have been incurred before the start of the
action, to prepare the proposal. Costs for plans that are required only later or that occur
when revising or implementing the plan may be eligible if the eligibility conditions are
fulfilled.
Protection of results — Costs related to the protection of the action’s results may be
eligible if the eligibility conditions are fulfilled. However, costs related to protection of other
intellectual property (e.g. background patents) are NOT eligible.
IPR access rights (HE) — Royalties paid for IPR access rights (and by extension any lump
sum payments) may be eligible costs provided that all the eligibility conditions are fulfilled
(e.g. necessary for the implementation of the action, incurred during the action, reasonable,
etc).
The following are however NOT eligible (or eligible only within certain limits):
− royalties for an exclusive licence: are eligible only if it can be shown that the
exclusivity (and thus the higher royalties) is absolutely necessary for the
implementation of the action
103EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− royalties for licensing agreements which were already in force before the start of the
action: only the part of the licence fee that can be linked to the action is eligible (since
the licence presumably goes beyond the action implementation)
− royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries for
implementing the action: since the default rule is that access rights are granted on a
royalty-free basis and beneficiaries may deviate only if agreed before grant signature,
royalties may be eligible only if explicitly agreed by all beneficiaries before grant
signature
Best practice: If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is
recommended that this is explained in detail in their proposal.
− royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries for exploiting
the results and by extension royalties paid to third parties for exploitation of the
results: are NOT eligible.
Costs related to research output management (HE) — Costs for research output
management (e.g. management of research data) are eligible if the eligibility conditions are
fulfilled, including open access to peer-reviewed publications (but see the additional eligibility
condition referenced immediately below), research data and other outputs.
Open access to scientific publications (HE) — In addition to fulfilling the other costs
eligibility criteria, publication fees are ONLY eligible when publishing in full open access
publishing venues (see Annex 5 > Communication, dissemination and visibility).

category.
1.4 The calculation method will depend on the type of cost and the provisions of each
specific cost category.

General > Article 6.2.D.1 > Financial support to third parties
D.1 Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (all programmes except RFCS,SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM)
D.1 Financial support to third parties
Costs for providing financial support to third parties (in the form of grants, prizes or similar forms of
support; if any) are eligible, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions, are calculated [on the basis of the costs actually incurred][as unit costs in accordance
with the method set out in Annex 2a] and the support is implemented in accordance with the conditions set
out in Annex 1.
These conditions must ensure objective and transparent selection procedures and include at least the
following:
(a) for grants (or similar):
(i) the maximum amount of financial support for each third party (‘recipient’); this amount
may not exceed the amount set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 3)30 or otherwise agreed
with the granting authority
(ii) the criteria for calculating the exact amount of the financial support
(iii) the different types of activity that qualify for financial support, on the basis of a closed list
(iv) the persons or categories of persons that will be supported and
(v) the criteria and procedures for giving financial support
(b) for prizes (or similar):
(i) the eligibility and award criteria
(ii) the amount of the prize and
(iii) the payment arrangements.
[This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate.]]
30 The amount must be specified in the call. It may not be more than 60 000 EUR, unless the objective of the action would otherwise be
impossible or overly difficult or in the case of humanitarian aid, emergency support operations, civil protection operations, or crisis
management aid (Article 207 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
1. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except RFCS, SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM) AND provided for in the call conditions, the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs under ‘Financial support to third parties
(FSTP)’, where giving such support is part of the action activities.
This budget category covers ‘cascading’ grants, prizes or similar (meaning where the
beneficiaries of the EU grant cascade down (part of) the financial contribution to third parties,
so-called ‘recipients’).
For some programmes, the specific cost category in Article 6 is complemented by specific
rules in Annex 5 for carrying out the action within the meaning of Article 18 (see Annex 5 >
HE Co-funded Partnerships).
106EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Financial support to third parties may be given to natural persons (e.g. allowance,
scholarship, fellowship) or legal persons (e.g. non-repayable financial assistance to local
NGOs), seed money to start-ups or microcredit, or other forms. Also prizes can be given on
the basis of a contest organised by the beneficiary.
Examples:
1. An action in the area of sustainable agriculture and forestry includes financial support for
end-users (farmers) testing the technology developed within the action.
2. One of the work packages in Annex 1 includes funding for awarding three scholarships in the field
of the action.
3. A prize announced at the beginning of the action for identifying a (new) approach to dealing with
a technical implementation problem to be tackled at the end of the action.
4. A grant is given to a beneficiary foreseeing that the beneficiary should fund local NGOs which in
turn provide food vouchers and microcredits to natural persons in third countries.
The financial support scheme itself is NOT an EU action; the beneficiaries are providing the
financial support in their own name and under their own responsibility. When promoting the
EU action (see Article 17), the financial support must therefore NOT be presented as directly
provided by the EU.
What not? Support in kind (e.g. transfer of material for free) by the beneficiary to a third
party is NOT considered financial support.
This cost category can only cover financial support. By contrast, cost for non-financial
support or support given in-kind (e.g. vouchers) must be declared under other categories (e.g. as
cost for purchases of vouchers).
The recipients are NOT party to the Grant Agreement and therefore do NOT need to be listed
nor be registered in the Participant Register.
1.2 Costs of financial support to third parties must normally be declared as actual costs (or,
very exceptionally, as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a —
currently only for SMP COSME EYE and ERDF-TA IVY).
1.3 The actual costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.1,
in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− respect the maximum amount of financial support to third parties as set out in the
description of the action (DoA; Annex 1) — normally up to EUR 60 000 per recipient,
but higher amounts are possible if necessary for the objectives of the action and
agreed with the granting authority (in the call conditions/Grant Agreement)
Systematic exceptions are foreseen for specific types of funding, such as humanitarian
aid, emergency support operations, civil protection operations, or crisis management aid
(see Article 207 FR 2024/2509).
and
− comply with the other conditions for the support that are set out in Annex 1, and in
particular:
− for cascading grants (or similar):
− the maximum amount per third party
107EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the criteria for determining the exact amount of financial support (e.g. EUR
2 000 per hectare; EUR 30 000 per student for a two-year scholarship)
Unless otherwise specified in the Grant Agreement, the financial support
provided by the beneficiaries may take any form (e.g. a lump sum or the
reimbursement of the costs incurred by the recipients when implementing the
supported activities); for the purposes of the EU grant, these remain however
actual costs.
− a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial
support for third parties (e.g. financial support for third parties allowed for
technology-testing activities)
These activities should benefit, primarily, the recipients (NOT the
beneficiaries).
− the persons or category(ies) of persons that may receive it (e.g. farmers; PhD
students, SMEs)
The procedures for selecting the recipients should be described in Annex 1.
− the criteria for giving financial support (e.g. physical characteristics of the
agricultural plots which make them suitable for the purpose of the action).
These criteria should respond to the objectives set out in the call conditions.
− for prizes:
− the amount of the prize (e.g. EUR 10 000)
− a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial
support to third parties and the award criteria for assessing the quality of
entries in light of the objectives and expected results
− the conditions for participation and the conditions for cancellation of the
contest, if any (e.g. eligibility and exclusion criteria; deadline for submission of
entries; possibility of jury interview)
The criteria must be objective.
− the payment arrangements (usually one payment).
− for other forms of financial support to third parties, at least:
− the maximum amount per recipient
− the criteria for determining the exact amount
− the types of activities to be funded
− the types of recipients eligible.
These conditions must also already be part of the proposal.
108EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The FSTP conditions (type of activities, eligible countries, etc) may have to follow similar
principles as those that apply to the beneficiaries themselves under the EU grant, if this is
provided in the call conditions (of the EU grant). These conditions must then also be specified in
the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1). Unless otherwise provided for in the call conditions,
financial support to third parties needs to be given directly from the EU grant beneficiary to the
(final) recipients, without further intermediaries.
The specific cost category in Article 6 is, for some programmes (HE, DEP, HUMA etc),
complemented by specific rules in Annex 5 for carrying out the action within the meaning of
Article 18.
1.4. Regarding the actual cost calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible costs
actually incurred (i.e. the amounts paid by the beneficiary for the cascading grants, prizes or
similar to the third parties during the duration of the action).
Specific cases (FSTP (D.1)):
(Micro)Loans and other financial instruments — If a call allows financial support to third
parties, directly or via implementing partners, in repayable form such as (micro)loans or
other financial instruments with a long-term character that exceed by their nature the
duration of the action and the EU Grant Agreement, Annex 1 must provide for specific
conditions on cost eligibility and acceptance.
For general guidance on financial support to third parties, see Guidance on good practices for
implementing FSTP in EU grants.

General > Article 6.2.D.2 > Internally invoiced goods and services
D.2 Internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF)
D.2 Internally invoiced goods and services
Costs for internally invoiced goods and services directly used for the action may be declared as unit cost
according to usual cost accounting practices, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions for such unit costs and the amount per unit is calculated:
(a) using the actual costs for the good or service recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts, attributed either
by direct measurement or on the basis of cost drivers, and excluding any cost which are ineligible or
already included in other budget categories; the actual costs may be adjusted on the basis of
budgeted or estimated elements, if they are relevant for calculating the costs, reasonable and
correspond to objective and verifiable information
and
(b) according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner, based on
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
‘Internally invoiced goods and services’ means goods or services which are provided within the beneficiary’s
organisation directly for the action and which the beneficiary values on the basis of its usual cost accounting
practices.
[This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate.]
1. Internally invoiced goods and services (D.2): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (HE, DEP and EDF), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs under ‘Internally invoiced goods and
services’.
This budget category covers the costs for goods and services that the beneficiary itself
produced or provided for the action. They may include (non-exhaustive list):
− self-produced consumables (e.g. electronic wafers, chemicals)
− use of specific devices or facilities needed for the action (e.g. clean room, wind tunnel,
supercomputer facilities, electronic microscope, animal house, greenhouse, aquarium)
− standardised testing or research and development processes (e.g. genomic test, mass
spectrometry analysis)
− hosting services for visiting project team members participating in the action (e.g.
housing, canteen).
What not? Costs of goods or services purchased and costs of goods or services internally
invoiced which are not directly used for the action (e.g. supporting services like cleaning,
general accountancy, administrative support, etc).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs in accordance with usual cost accounting
practices. The usual cost accounting practices must define both the unit (e.g. hour of use of
wind tunnel, one genomic test, one electronic wafer fabricated internally, etc) and the
methodology to determine the cost of the unit.
It is NOT necessary to have a document called ‘internal invoice’ to support these costs, but
the beneficiary should have a documented methodology how to determine them (such a
110EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
methodology must be part of its usual costs accounting practices). The beneficiary must also
keep supporting evidence of the use of the good or service for the action and showing the
number of units used.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.2, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary for the action, identifiable and verifiable, etc; see Article
6.1(b))
− be in line with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices and
− the cost accounting practices must have been applied in a consistent manner, based
on objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
It must be the usual practice of the beneficiary to calculate a unit cost for that good or
service. The unit costs is the internal cost per unit that is charged between departments of
the same entity; it is not the price charged in the context of commercial sales or to grants
from other fund providers.
The beneficiary must consistently apply its usual cost accounting practices to calculate the
unit cost, based on objective criteria that must be verifiable if there is a check, audit, review
or investigation. You must do this no matter who is funding the action.
Example (ineligible): If you set up a new unit cost which applies only to EU actions, the
internally invoiced costs based on that new unit cost would be ineligible as they would not be your
usual cost accounting practice.
Example (eligible): If you make adjustments to comply with the Grant Agreement because the
usual methodology includes an ineligible cost item, the adjusted methodology will still be
considered as your usual cost accounting practice and not as a new unit cost.
1.4 The costs must be calculated using the actual costs recorded in the beneficiary’s
accounts, excluding any ineligible costs or costs already included in other budget categories:
− if necessary, the unit cost must be adjusted to remove:
− cost elements that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (even if they are
part of the beneficiary’s usual methodology for determining the unit cost for its
internal invoices)
Example: The beneficiary uses internal invoices for the use of an electronic microscope
based on a unit cost per hour of use. The methodology to calculate the unit cost
includes costs of capital (e.g. interest charged by the bank for a loan used to buy the
microscope). Those costs are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (see Article 6.3) and
must therefore be removed. The unit cost must be recalculated without them.
You can NOT simply apply an estimated percentage of deduction on the amount
of your internal invoices to remove ineligible costs. You have to ensure that the
internal invoice does not include any ineligible costs.
− costs of resources that do not belong to the beneficiary and which it uses free
of charge (e.g. personnel or equipment of a third party provided free of
charge), because those costs are not in its accounts (see Article 6.1(a)(v))
− costs that are already included in other budget categories (double funding of
the same costs, see Article 6.1(a)(i))
Example: The beneficiary uses internal invoices for water chemistry analyses, based on
a unit cost per water sample analysed. The methodology to calculate the unit cost
includes the cost of the staff carrying out the analysis. However, the costs for those
111EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
persons are already charged to the action under direct personnel costs (category A.1).
The cost of the staff must therefore be removed and the unit cost must be recalculated
without them.
− if budgeted or estimated elements were included in the calculation of the amount per
unit, those elements must:
− be relevant (i.e. clearly related to invoiced item)
− be used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not play major role in calculating the unit
cost)
− correspond to objective and verifiable information (i.e. their basis is clearly
defined and the beneficiary can show how they were calculated)
− only the share of the actual costs that are used for the production of the internally
invoiced good or service may be included in the pool of costs used to determine the
cost per unit; the share of these costs must be calculated by direct measurement
(‘direct costs’). The pool must not include any indirect costs (except for in HE, see
specific cases below), in particular not general administrative costs
Allocation keys resulting in a higher unit cost for the internally invoiced good or
service when used in EU grants compared with other projects will NOT be accepted.
Impact on horizontal 215-days ceiling — The share of the cost of a cost item
included in the internal invoice reduces the share of the cost item that can be charged as
direct costs to EU actions. For example, the share of the working time of a person that is
included in the calculation of the unit cost reduces the number of day-equivalents that the
person can charge over the year to EU grants (see Article 6.2.A).
Double funding risk — The same time of the person can NOT be charged twice to the
grant, i.e. it can NOT be once embedded in the unit cost and again as direct personnel
costs.
Example (costs for use of an animal housing facility):
Generally eligible as part of the unit cost:
– staff working for the facility (e.g. keepers, veterinarians and other persons directly
assigned to run the animal house)
– consumables used for the animal housing (e.g. animal food, bedding)
– depreciation of cages and other equipment directly used to the housing of the animals
– generic supplies like electricity or water used in the facility
– specific maintenance and cleaning of the animal house facility
– costs of shared infrastructures where the animal housing is located (e.g. central heating,
air-conditioning system) and their shared maintenance costs, allocated via usual key
driver
– shared services with allocation of the costs incurred for the animal house facility via usual
key driver (e.g. shared cleaning services of the building where the animal housing is
located)
– depreciation costs of shared buildings allocated via usual key driver (e.g. if the animal
housing is part of a main building of the beneficiary)
Generally ineligible as part of the unit cost:
– bank interests
– provisions for future expenses
– cost declared under other cost categories (e.g. personnel cost, equipment depreciation
cost) and indirect cost (e.g. facility management costs allocated on the basis of the
square meters the shelter occupies, general administrative costs such as those
stemming from the HR, legal or accounting departments)
– any other ineligible costs (see Article 6.3)
112EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example (costs for use of a wind tunnel facility):
Generally eligible as part of the unit cost:
– staff working for the facility (e.g. technicians, engineers and other persons directly
assigned to the functioning of the wind tunnel)
– depreciation of the equipment, including specific software and hardware necessary for the
functioning of the wind tunnel
– generic supplies like electricity used for the wind tunnel
– insurance of the wind tunnel (or the premises in which it is located)
– specific maintenance and cleaning of the wind tunnel equipment (e.g. air cooling system)
– calibration/metrology tests of the wind tunnel
– costs of shared infrastructures where the wind tunnel is located, allocated via usual key
driver (e.g. central heating, air-conditioning system) and their related shared
maintenance costs
– depreciation costs of shared buildings allocated via usual key driver (e.g. if the building
where the wind tunnel is located is part of a main building of the beneficiary)
Generally ineligible as part of the unit cost:
– bank interests
– provisions for future expenses
– cost declared under other cost categories (e.g. personnel cost, equipment depreciation
cost) and indirect cost (e.g. power supply costs allocated to a clean room on the basis of
the square meters it occupies, general administrative costs such as those stemming from
the HR, legal or accounting departments)
– any other ineligible costs (see Article 6.3)
Double funding risk — The same time of the person can NOT be charged twice to the grant,
i.e. it can NOT be once embedded in the unit cost and again as direct personnel costs.
Specific cases (costs of internally invoiced goods and services (D.2)):
Actual direct and indirect costs (HE) — If part of the usual cost accounting practices,
beneficiaries may calculate the share of the actual costs that are used for the production of
the internally invoiced good or service either by direct measurement (‘direct costs’; see
above) or by using the allocation keys defined in the costs accounting practices (‘indirect
costs’) (e.g. power supply costs allocated to a clean room on the basis of the square meters it
occupies, general administrative costs such as those stemming from the HR, legal or
accounting departments).
Co-owned resources— As an exception, if the resource for which the unit cost is calculated
is co-owned by the beneficiary and a third party, the costs registered in the accounts of the
third party for the co-owned resource do not need to be removed if:
− the third party is mentioned in the grant (e.g. as beneficiary, affiliated entity or, for
HE, third party providing in-kind contributions in Annex 1) and
− the costs fulfil the other eligibility conditions of this Article (e.g. directly linked to the
resource, exclude ineligible costs, etc).

1. HE Transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure unit costs (D.3 and
D.4): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 This cost category will be inserted for the Horizon Europe standard types of action (e.g.
RIA, CSA, COFUND, etc) that involve transnational and/or virtual access to research
infrastructure for scientific communities (‘provision of access activities’), in particular calls
under Part III of the HE Work Programme, ‘Research Infrastructures’.
This cost category is optional. Beneficiaries can declare their access costs either as unit
costs under this cost category OR simply as actual costs under another fitting cost category
(e.g. purchase cost), OR — where duly justified and subject to certain conditions — as a
combination of unit costs and actual costs.
The specific cost category in Article 6 is complemented by specific rules in Annex 5 for
carrying out the action within the meaning of Article 18 (see Annex 5 > HE access for
research infrastructure activities).
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘transnational or virtual
access to research infrastructure unit costs’.
The budget category covers direct and indirect access costs for providing transnational access
to research infrastructure (i.e. the installation’s operating costs and costs related to logistical,
technological and scientific support for users, including ad-hoc user training and the
preparatory and closing activities needed to use the installation).
114EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What not? Travel and subsistence costs for users to get transnational access are not
included in the access costs. These costs can be reimbursed separately, in category C.1
Travel and subsistence; see Article 6.2.C.1.
1.2 If declared under this budget category, the costs must be declared as unit costs, using
the unit cost table (rates per unit of access) agreed with the granting authority (see HE RI
authorising decision16 and Annex 2a and 2b).
The ‘unit of access’ must be identified for each installation (i.e. the unit used to measure the
quantity of access that the installation provides to its users).
The precise unit cost (amount per unit, i.e. EUR/unit of access) is not prefixed by the
authorising decision. It must be calculated for each access provider and installation (you can
use the calculators (calculator HE UN RI TA and calculator HE UN RI VA) provided on the call
page) and then summarised in the table ‘Summary of transnational/virtual access provision’
in the proposal and in the unit cost table in Annex 2b of the Grant Agreement:
Short name Short Installation Unit of Amount Estimated Total unit
access name access per unit No of units cost
provider infrastru No Short name (cost per unit
cture x estimated
no of units)
The summary table in the proposal is generic (must be filled in for all proposals giving access
to research infrastructure, even if they do not use the unit cost). Annex 2b is needed only for
actions that use the unit cost.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (unit of access rate) is:
− for transnational access:
{average annual total access costs to the installation (over past two years)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
average annual total quantity of access to the installation (over past two years)}
− for virtual access:
{total virtual access costs to the installation (over the last year)
_ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
total quantity of virtual access to the installation (over the last year)}
The averages must be based on:
− the beneficiary’s certified or auditable historical data
− costs allocated to the installation according to the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices (including where the installation has been in operation for less than two
years) and
16 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
115EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− a period excluding times when the installation was not usable (out of order, under repair
or undergoing long-term maintenance).
In exceptional and duly justified cases, the granting authority may agree with a beneficiary to
use a different reference period than the ones referred to above (two years for transnational
access and one year for virtual access).
The ‘total quantity of access’ means all the units of access annually provided by the installation,
included access financed under previous EU grants, if any.
The ‘annual total access costs to the installation’ is calculated on the basis of the following
categories of eligible costs:
− the direct costs incurred by the access provider for the ‘annual total quantity of access to
the installation’, as recorded in the certified or auditable profit-and-loss accounts of the
reference period for:
− personnel costs of administrative, technical and scientific staff directly assigned to
the functioning of the installation and to the support of the users
− costs of contracts for maintenance and repair (including specific cleaning, calibrating
and testing) specifically awarded for the functioning of the installation (if not
capitalised)
− costs of consumables specifically used for the installation and the user’s research
work
− costs of contracts for installation management, including security fees, insurance
costs, quality control and certification, upgrading to national and/or EU quality,
safety or security standards (if not capitalised) specifically incurred for the
functioning of the installation
− costs of energy power and water supplied for the installation where it can be verified
as being supplied exclusively for the installation and as being a major cost item for
the installation
− costs of general services when they are specifically included in the provided access
services (e.g. library costs, shipping costs, transport costs)
− costs of software licence, internet connection or other electronic services for data
management and computing when they are needed to provide access services
− costs of specific scientific services included in the access provided or needed for the
provision of access
− the indirect costs for providing access to the installation, equal to 25% of the eligible direct
costs
AND excluding:
− all contributions to the capital investments of the installation (including rental, lease
or depreciation costs of buildings as well as depreciation and lease of
instrumentation); those costs are not eligible unless otherwise specified in the work
programme/call conditions, in which case only the portion used to provide access
under the action can be eligible
− travel and subsistence costs for users
− ineligible costs as referred to in Article 6.3.
Example (amount per unit):
Assuming that a telescope provided 6 100 hours of access in year N-1 and 5 900 hours of
access in year N-2 and that the total access costs (for the provision of these total quantities of
access) in the two years calculated on the basis of the categories of costs indicated above (with
the exclusion of any contribution to capital investment and of travel and subsistence costs of
users) is respectively EUR 3 200 000 and EUR 2 800 000, then the unit cost is
Average costs = average (3 200 000, 2 800 000) = 3 000 000
Average hours = average (6 100, 5 900) = 6 000
Unit cost = average (3 200 000, 2 800 000) / average (6 100, 5 900) = 3 000 000 /6 000 =
500 €
116EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The detailed calculations used (one calculator sheet for each installation) must be kept by
beneficiaries as supporting documents in case of audits.
The granting authority may verify that the proposed unit costs comply with the prescribed
calculation method (and correct them, if needed).
The proposal and Annex 1 should describe the access services provided and the logistical,
technological and scientific support given to users (including ad-hoc training and preparatory
and closing activities necessary to use the installation).
As mentioned above, the use of unit costs for transnational and virtual access activities is
optional, i.e. each access provider can decide for each installation whether to be reimbursed
on the basis of unit costs, actual costs or a combination of the two. This decision must be
taken before grant signature and applied consistently throughout the action. In duly justified
cases, for example when there are significant variations in the costs for providing access, it
can be updated through an amendment with the agreement of the granting authority.
Double funding risk — Costs that are declared as a specific unit cost can NOT be declared a
second time under another budget category (for the costs that are covered, see below).
Example: A same cost item (e.g the salary of a member of the research infrastructure staff) cannot be used
for calculating the unit cost and then charged as actual cost under personnel costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.3 and
6.2.D.4, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1 (b))
− be incurred for providing transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure to
scientific communities.
1.4 They must be calculated, for each access provider and installation, , in accordance with
the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure unit
costs is:
{amount per unit [rate per unit of access set out in Annex 2b]}
multiplied by
{number of actual units of access provided}
The unit of access rate is fixed by the granting authority, based on the rates proposed by the
beneficiaries in Annex 2b (see above).

General > Article 6.2.D.[X] > HE PCP/PPI procurement costs
D.5 HE PCP/PPI procurement costs
[OPTION for HE PCP/PPI: D.5 PCP/PPI procurement costs
PCP/PPI procurement costs are eligible, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions, are calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred and:
- are incurred for a joint pre-commercial procurement or joint or coordinated public procurement of
innovative goods and services targeted by the action and described in Annex 1 and
- the procurement is carried out by a ‘contracting authority/entity’ as defined in the EU public
procurement Directives (in particular, Directives 2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU and 2009/81/EC).
The beneficiaries must award the procurement contracts to the tender(s) offering best value for money and
use objective and transparent procedures which — unless otherwise provided in the call conditions —
include:
- if a preliminary market consultation is carried out: the publication of a prior information notice about
the consultation in the Official Journal of the European Union
- the publication of a contract notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
- the publication of a contract award notice within 48 days after concluding the contract(s) in the
Official Journal of the European Union
in English and any additional language(s) chosen by the beneficiaries.
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security reasons, the beneficiaries must
ensure that the performance of the contract takes place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in
the call conditions — unless otherwise approved by the granting authority.
For PPI procurements, beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU
Directives on public procurement must also comply with these Directives and the applicable national law on
public procurement.
The beneficiaries which act as procurers (i.e. the buyers group and the lead procurer), the object and
estimated cost for each procurement and the estimated financial contribution per member of the buyers group
must be set out in Annex 1 and the estimated procurement costs per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2.
The costs for the cost categories other than procurement costs are eligible only up to 50% of the total
estimated eligible costs of the action set out in Annex 2.
This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate. ]

1. HE PCP/PPI procurement costs (D.5): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility
conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for Horizon Europe PCP/PPI actions (i.e. calls
with PCP/PPI ToA).
118EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This cost category is used ONLY for calls that run as PCP/PPI type of action (i.e. where
also the Annex 5 > HE PCP and PPI procurements provisions apply).
For these calls, the rules for subcontracts and subcontractors in Article 6.2.B and
Article 9.3 do NOT apply for the PCP or PPI procurement. Costs must be charged under
Article 6.2.D.5 (new for 2021-2027).
Other types of calls (RIA, IA, CSA, etc) are NOT subject to Article 6.2.D.5 (nor to
Annex 5) —even if projects should include PCP or PPI activities. For them, the PCP/PPI
activities must be handled as subcontracting in accordance with Article 6.2.B and Article
9.3.
However, for BOTH groups, the detailed provisions in General Annex H of the HE Work
Programme apply. If you plan to implement PCP or PPI activities in a Horizon Europe
action, you should therefore always first look at the General Annex.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘PCP/PPI procurement
costs’.
This budget category ‘covers only the costs of the PCP/PPI procurement (i.e. the price of the
PCP/PPI procurement paid to the PCP/PPI providers, including related duties, taxes and
charges, such as non-deductible, non-refundable value added tax (VAT)). Only costs of R&D
services (PCP) or innovative solutions (PPI) procured by the beneficiaries are eligible.
Be aware that different duties, taxes and charges (in particular also a different VAT rate)
may apply depending on the payment set-up for the procurement (centralised or
decentralised payments).
What not? It does not cover the costs for the additional activities related to the PCP/PPI
procurement.
‘Additional activities’ are the activities needed to prepare, manage and follow-up the PCP/PPI
procurement (including testing of solutions by the lead procurer, buyers group, or other end-
users) and further activities to embed the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side activities.
Some of those are a mandatory part of the EU action (e.g. the activities needed to coordinate
and implement the PCP/PPI procurement; see mandatory deliverables defined in General
Annex H of the HE Work Programme); others are optional (e.g. activities to embed the
PCP/PPI procurement into a wider set of demand side activities), unless otherwise specified in
the work programme/call conditions.
Examples (other additional activities): Activities that aim to remove barriers to introducing an
innovative solution on the market (including standardisation, certification and regulation); activities
that prepare the ground for cooperation on future PCP or PPI projects; awareness raising and
experience sharing/training.
Costs for additional activities must always be charged under the fitting standard cost
categories, even when they involve the procurement of (non PCP/PPI) goods or services.
Example (additional activities):
Personnel costs: Costs incurred by the lead procurer, buyers group and other consortium
participants for consulting the market, preparing the call for tender documents etc must be
charged under cost category A.
Subcontracting costs: For web design or publicity campaign to promote the PCP/PPI
procurement, for external experts that support the buyers group in evaluation of tenders must be
charged under cost category B.
Purchase costs: For travel tickets, consumables and equipment that needs to be bought by the
buyers group to test innovative solutions of the providers that win the PCP/PPI contracts must be
charged under cost category C.
119EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Financial support to third parties (FSTP): To award a prize to the solution provider(s) that
performed best in the PCP/PPI procurement must be charged under cost category D.
In-kind contributions (free of charge): Potential end-users of the solutions (e.g. fire brigade)
may make available personnel/equipment to the buyers group (e.g. Ministry of interior) to help test
innovative solutions. For HE PCP/PPI actions, the costs of the personnel/equipment may be
declared as eligible costs by the beneficiaries which use them under the standard cost categories A
and C.2, as if they were their own (see Article 6.1).
Indirect costs for the PCP/PPI procurement costs are also NOT reimbursed.
1.2 PCP/PPI procurement costs must be declared as actual costs (i.e. the price actually
paid).
1.3 The ‘PCP/PPI procurement costs’ must fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article
6.2.D.5, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a))
− be incurred for the PCP/PPI procurement described in Annex 1
− be based on the best value for money
− not be subject to conflict of interest
− awarded following objective and transparent procedures that comply with certain
minimum conditions and
− for PPI: for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’
within the meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24/EU,
2014/25/EU and 2009/81/EC): comply with these Directives and the applicable
national law on public procurement
For PCP/PPI procurements, the contracts may NOT be awarded based on the lowest
price as the only award criterion. In addition to the price, it is mandatory to take into
account also the quality of the proposed innovative solutions in the evaluation of the
tenders.
The minimum procedural conditions explicitly mentioned in Article 6 include obligations to
publish in the OJEU (TED portal) — at least in English (and in any additional languages
chosen by the beneficiaries) — prior information notices (PIN) to announce the open market
consultation and the upcoming PCP/PPI procurement, as well as contract notices and contract
award notices for the PCP/PPI call for tenders.
Regarding deadlines for publication of notices, we will consider as the ‘date of publication’
the date when you submitted the notice to the OJEU Publication Office.
Additional transparency requirements (including timing and exceptions) are set out in Annex
5 > PCP and PPI procurements and General Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
For general guidance on PCP/PPI types of action in HE, see How to set up and manage HE PCP
and PPI grants, HE Programme Guide > Innovation Procurement and General Annexes B and H of
the HE Work Programme.
120EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For PCP procurements, the EU Public Procurement Directives normally do not apply (because
exempted17). However, national laws on public procurement may apply if they have rules for
this type of R&D service contracts. For PPI procurements, both the EU Directives and the
national laws apply.
The beneficiaries which act as procurers (i.e. the buyers group and the lead procurer), the
object and estimated cost for each procurement and the estimated financial contribution per
member of the buyers group must be justified in Annex 1. There is NO simplified approval
procedure).
Finally, there is a cost eligibility ceiling: PCP/PPI procurement costs must amount to a
minimum of 50% of the total estimated costs of the action in the budget table, and all
additional costs can amount to maximum 50% of the costs. This is due to the fact that the
PCP/PPI procurement should be the main objective of PCP/PPI actions.
The maximum amount for additional activities is fixed at Grant Agreement signature, based
on all the estimated eligible costs of the action. The maximum amount of EU funding for
additional activities therefore does NOT change (i.e. will NOT be reduced by the granting
authority) when at the end of the action it turns out that the costs actually incurred for
PCP/PPI procurement are less than initially estimated (e.g. if the buyers group is able to
procure at a better price than it had initially budgeted).
1.4 Regarding the calculation, the amount charged as eligible cost must correspond to the
price invoiced for the PCP/PPI procurement(s).
17 See Article 14 of Directive 2014/24, Article 32 of Directive 2014/25 and Article 13(f)(j) of Directive 2009/81.

changes in relation to the additional funding granted, the coordinator must request an
amendment in order to change the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure; for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the
beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting authority might not approve the change
and reject the costs at interim or final payment-stage later on. It is highly recommended to
contact the granting authority before deciding on any change.
Examples (change that could be accepted):
1. The additional funding was awarded to purchase a particular piece of major equipment. During
the implementation of the action, the PI proposes to use the additional funding to acquire a newly
developed equipment that would allow the research team to carry out the action tasks in a more
efficient manner. This change could be accepted.

The entity’s statutes must include a provision that, in case of dissolution,
the land will be transferred to another legal body primarily active in the field
of nature conservation (e.g. another conservation NGO or appropriate public
body).
− for purchases of partial rights: the entry into the land register must duly reflect
the long term nature conservation objectives and the requirements set out in
Article 6.2.D.2 of the Grant Agreement
− for land purchased to be exchanged at a later date for another parcel on which
the action will be undertaken: the exchange must be carried out before the end
of the action and the land exchanged must comply with the requirements set
out in Article 6.2.D.2 of the Grant Agreement.
For long-term leases:
− the lease must be of at least 20 years (unless provided otherwise in the call
conditions)
− the lease must include provisions and commitments that ensure the
achievement of its objectives in terms of habitat and species protection.
Land purchases must be done by one of the project participants who is either a well-
established private organisation (e.g. nature conservation NGO or other) or a public body
with nature conservation responsibility, and must remain in its ownership after the end of the
project.
The purchased land must be the subject, during the action, of specific restoration and/or
active management or restrictions of use that go beyond existing legal obligations or existing
restrictions that could be imposed without purchasing the land. The purchase of land that is
already in excellent conservation status (i.e. that requires no restoration or specific
management or restrictions of use) is eligible only very exceptionally, if indispensable for the
objectives of the project.
Evidence must be provided that the land (to be) purchased was not owned by a public
authority in the 24 months before the project application was submitted to the EU.
Compliance with all applicable conditions must be specifically demonstrated in the proposal.
In particular, proposals are expected to include:
131EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− evidence that the purchase price is consistent with the market price for the type of
land and the region concerned (e.g. letter from competent authority, registered
notary, real estate agent, etc)
− In case of land purchase, long term lease and one-off compensations, the
beneficiaries need to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness already at proposal stage.
During the project (and at the latest with the final report), we will require a copy of the sales
contract and/or entry in the land register, including the guarantee related to the long-term
conservation. For countries that do not allow to include such guarantee in land registers and
sales contract, you will be required to provide an equivalent guarantee, with the same legal
level of protection in the long term.

1. AMIF EMN ad hoc queries (D.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for AMIF AMN actions.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs for ‘EMN ad hoc
queries’.
This budget category covers all the eligible costs except translation costs, including but not
limited to direct personnel costs and expert costs for ad hос queries, either launched by
European Migration Network National Contact Point (EMN NCP) or the European Commission,
to which they provide a written response.
1.2 They must be declared as unit costs, using the unit cost (rate per query) agreed with
the granting authority (see AMIF authorising decision18 and Annex 2a and 2b).
The precise unit cost (amount per unit, i.e. EUR/ad hoc query answered in writing) is not
prefixed by the authorising decision. It must be calculated for each grant and then entered
into the unit cost table in Annex 2b of the Grant Agreement.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (rate per query) is:
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities using only own personnel (or personnel of
another department that is part of the same legal entity) to reply to queries:
average personnel costs for one hour spent on ad hoc query (over past two
years), i.e.:
{((average of the annual remunerations (i.e. salaries, social security contributions,
taxes and other statutory costs included in the remuneration) of the employees
working on ad hoc queries (over past two years)

1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.2, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− relate to ad hoc queries of other EMN national contact points or the European
Commission (participating in the network) that were answered in writing.
1.4 The costs must be calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the
authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the costs for EMN ad hoc queries is:
{amount per unit [rate per query fixed in Annex 2b]}
multiplied by
{number of ad hoc queries answered in writing}
The rate per query is fixed by the granting authority, based on the rate proposed by the
beneficiary/affiliated entity in Annex 2b (see above).

2.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for AMIF AMN actions.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs for ‘EMN translation of
ad hoc queries’.
This budget category covers eligible direct costs relating to translation fees generated by the
ad hoc queries, either launched by European Migration Network National Contact Point (EMN
NCP) or the European Commission.
2.2 They must be declared as unit costs, using the unit cost (rate per translated query)
agreed with the granting authority (see AMIF authorising decision19 and Annex 2a and 2b).
The precise unit cost (amount per unit, i.e. EUR/translated query) is not prefixed by the
authorising decision. It must be calculated for each grant and then entered into the unit cost
table in Annex 2b of the Grant Agreement.

− relate to replies to ad hoc queries of other EMN national contact points or the
European Commission that were translated externally (i.e. not by personnel of the
beneficiary organisation).
2.4 The costs must be calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the

Indirect costs will be reimbursed at the flat-rate of [7%][[…%]] of the [OPTION A for programmes with

exempted specific cost categories, if any)][OPTION C for programmes with flat rate on different base: [list
the costs on which the flat-rate should be based, e.g. personnel costs (category A, except volunteers costs, if
any)]]. ]
1. Indirect costs (E.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes; except CEF, CCEI and
some LIFE and EUAF calls), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge the ‘Indirect
costs’.
This budget category covers all costs for the action that are not directly linked to it (i.e.
overheads).
1.2 Indirect costs are declared as a fixed flat-rate (except EDF). For most programmes the
flat-rate is fixed at 7% of the eligible direct costs in accordance with Article 184(6) EU
Financial Regulation 2024/250920; for some programmes, a higher rate is foreseen in the
Programme Regulation (basic act; see specific cases below)).
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.E, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for flat-rate costs to be eligible (i.e. costs to which the flat-
rate is applied must be eligible, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1(c))
1.4 The costs must be calculated by applying the 7% flat-rate to the eligible costs
(categories A-D, except volunteers costs and exempted specific cost categories, if any).
The calculation itself is automated: The indirect cost amount is prefilled by the IT system.
Beneficiaries can change the amount, if they would like to request less indirect costs (for
instance, because they have a parallel EU operating grant and are not able to demonstrate
cost separation; see specific cases below).
Specific cases (indirect costs (E.))
25% indirect cost flat-rate (HE, SME COSME EEN, EDF) — If this option is activated in the
Grant Agreement, the flat-rate is 25%, but the pool of eligible cost is smaller (categories A-D,
20 [old Financial Regulation: Article 181(6) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
136EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
except volunteers costs, subcontracting costs, financial support to third parties (FSTP) and
exempted specific cost categories, if any).
For Horizon Europe, all specific cost categories except D.7 ERC additional costs are exempted
(i.e. do NOT count for the flat-rate).
Example:
A public university is a beneficiary under a Grant Agreement and has incurred the following costs:
− EUR 100 000 personnel costs
− EUR 20 000 subcontracting costs
− EUR 10 000 other goods and services (consumables).
Eligible direct costs: 100 000 + 20 000 + 10 000 = EUR 130 000
Eligible indirect costs: 25 % of (100 000 + 10 000) = EUR 27 500
Total eligible costs: EUR 157 500
Other indirect cost flat-rates (RFCS, AGRIP, SMP ESS) — If other options are activated in
the Grant Agreement, the system will automatically calculate the indirect costs using those
flat-rates (e.g. RFCS 35%, AGRIP 4%, SMP ESS 30% all on category A. Personnel costs,
except volunteers costs).
Actual indirect costs (EDF) — If provided for in the call conditions, the beneficiaries may
charge actual indirect cost in accordance with the rules of the Grant Agreement (instead of a
flat-rate). Only beneficiaries whose usual cost accounting practices to calculate indirect costs
are accepted by national authorities for comparable activities in the defence domain can use
this option. This means that if your national authorities do not accept actual indirect costs for
national contracts (e.g. they accept only a simplification option like flat-rates) or you have
not carried out comparable activities in the defence domain under national contracts, you
cannot use this option. Different beneficiaries within the same action may choose different
options for their indirect costs.
Combining of EU action and operating grants — Beneficiaries that have parallel EU
action grants and operating grants may claim indirect costs in their action grants ONLY if they
are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that their operating grants do not cover any
costs which are covered by their action grants).
‘Operating grants’ are not always easy to identify. They exist under various labels (operating
grants; financial contributions/support to the functioning/operation of entities; etc). Check
your call conditions.
Example: Operating grants are grants awarded to support the running costs of certain institutions
pursuing an aim of European interest, such as: College of Europe, European standards bodies
(CEN, CENELEC, ETSI).
To demonstrate cost separation, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
− the operating grant may NOT cover 100% of the beneficiary’s annual budget (i.e. it
may not be a full operating grant)
− the beneficiary must use analytical accounting which allows for a cost accounting
management with cost allocation keys and cost accounting codes AND must apply
these keys and codes to identify and separate the costs (i.e. to allocate them to either
the action grant activities or the operating grant activities)
− the beneficiary must record:
− all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by their operating
grants (i.e. personnel, general running costs and other operating costs linked
to the operating grant work programme of activities) and
− all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by the action grant
(including the real indirect costs linked to the action)
137EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the allocation of the costs must be done in a way that leads to a fair, objective and
realistic result.
Beneficiaries that cannot fulfil these conditions must either:
− keep the operating grant, but sign the action grant without indirect costs or request
no indirect costs at reporting stage (i.e. lower the pre-filled amount in the indirect cost
column of the financial statement)
or
− renounce to the operating grant, in order to be able to claim the indirect costs in the
action grant.
Best practice: In case of overlapping EU action and operating grants, contact the granting
authority for advice.

1. Contributions (F.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (currently not in any programme), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Contributions’.
Contributions are simplified forms of output based funding. They are normally based on an
approximation of the costs, calculated ex-ante, and paid on the basis of pre-defined mile
stones/work packages. However, contrary to simplified costs (e.g. unit cost), they do not
work with funding rates (because the contribution already incorporates the funding rate in
the ex-ante calculation of the amount). This means that there is no need to apply any
funding rate to the amount claimed by the recipient in a request for payment.
139EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Currently no EU programme uses simplified contributions inside their actual cost grants (i.e.
all budget categories are calculated with a funding rate).
By contrast, full lump sum or unit grants (e.g. in HE, DEP, CEF, INNOVFUND, JTM, etc) are
usually contribution-based (meaning no funding rate needed in the budget table in Annex 2).

This may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
31 For the definition, see Article 183(2)(b) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: ‘operating grant’ means an EU grant to finance “the
functioning of a body which has an objective forming part of and supporting an EU policy”.
32 Condition must be specified in the call.
1.Types of ineligible costs and contributions
What? Costs and contributions are ineligible, if one of the following applies:
− they do not meet the general and specific eligibility conditions set out in Articles 6.1
and 6.2
Examples: Bonuses paid by participants that do not fulfil the conditions set out in Article 6.2;
subcontracting costs that do not comply with Article 6.2.
− they are listed in Article 6.3, in particular:
− costs related to return on capital or dividends paid by a beneficiary
Example: Dividends paid as remuneration for investing in the action; remuneration paid
as a share in the company’s equity.
− debt and debt service charges
‘Debt service’ is the amount paid on a loan in principal and interest, over a
period of time.
Example: A beneficiary takes a loan used to acquire equipment or consumables for the
project of EUR 100 000 at 9 percent interest for 10 years, the debt service for the first
year (principal and interest) is EUR 15 582 and cannot be declared as eligible cost.
− provisions for future losses or debts
‘Provision’ means an amount set aside in an organisation’s accounts, to cover for
a known liability of uncertain timing or amount. This includes allowances for
doubtful or bad debts.
− interest owed (e.g. negative interest charged to the beneficiary’s bank account )
− currency exchange losses (i.e. for beneficiaries using currencies other than euros
or being invoiced in a currency other than the currency they use: any loss due to
exchange rate fluctuations, e.g. between the date of invoicing and the date of
payment)
− bank costs charged by the beneficiary’s bank for transfers from the granting
authority
Conversely, bank charges for the distribution of the EU funding from the
coordinator to the beneficiaries may constitute an eligible cost for the
coordinator (if the eligibility conditions of Article 6.1 and Article 6.2.C.3 are
met).
− excessive or reckless expenditure
142EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Excessive’ means paying significantly more for products, services or personnel
than the prevailing market rates or the usual practices of the beneficiary (and
thus resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action).
‘Reckless’ means failing to exercise care in the selection of products, services or
personnel (and thus resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action).
− ineligible VAT (deductible or refundable VAT, including VAT paid by public bodies
acting as public authority)
The detailed provisions regarding the eligibility of VAT under the Financial
Regulation 2024/2509 are as follows:
VAT is eligible where it is not recoverable under the applicable national VAT
legislation AND is paid by a beneficiary other than a non-taxable person within
the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 13(1) of Directive 2006/11221
(see Article 189(4)(c) FR22).
VAT is considered ‘not recoverable’ within the meaning of Article 189(4) FR if it
is not deductible or refundable under the applicable national VAT legislation.
This is, in particular, the case if according to national law it is attributable to any
of the following activities:
− (i) exempt activities without right of deduction
− (ii) activities which fall outside the scope of VAT
− (iii) activities, as referred to in point (i) or (ii), in respect of which
VAT is not deductible but refunded by means of specific refund
schemes or compensation funds not referred to in Directive
2006/112, even if that scheme or fund is established by national VAT
legislation.
‘Non-taxable persons’ are inter alia public bodies (i.e. states, regional and local
government authorities and other bodies governed by public law) in respect of
activities or transactions in which they engage as public authorities (see Article
13(1) Directive 2006/112). However, Article 189(4) FR clarifies that, for the
purposes of eligibility of costs for EU funding, VAT relating to the activities listed
in Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112 must be regarded as paid by a ‘beneficiary
other than a non-taxable person’, regardless of whether those activities are
regarded by the Member State concerned as activities engaged in by bodies
governed by public law acting as public authorities. Thus, ‘VAT paid by public
bodies acting as public authority’ (meaning any VAT, whether
deductible/refundable or not) is ineligible for public bodies acting as public
authority. However, this does not include VAT relating to the activities listed in
Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112 which can be eligible provided they are not
deductible or refundable.
The general idea is therefore that in principle only VAT that is a genuine and
definitive cost should normally be charged to the EU actions (— however subject
to the boundaries and exceptions set out above).
21 Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (OJ L 347,
11.12.2006, p. 1).
22 [old Financial Regulation: Article 186(4)(c) FR 2018/1046].
143EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best practice: Ideally, VAT amounts (both if eligible and not) should be clearly
identifiable in the accounting records.
Thus, the cost and revenue accounts should exclude deductible and refundable
VAT; such VAT should be recorded in separate payable or receivable accounts,
without effect on revenue or cost line items.
VAT paid is a claim against the tax authority. It should be recorded in the
‘assets’ part of the balance sheet. It should not be recorded as expenditure in
the profit and loss accounts (only the purchase price of goods and services
excluding VAT should be recorded). Similarly, for the value of purchased
equipment or assets, only the net purchase cost should be recorded in the
balance sheet’s fixed asset line, and the depreciation cost should be calculated
based on this value, excluding VAT.
VAT collected is a debt towards the tax authority and should therefore be
recorded in the ‘liabilities’ part of the balance sheet.
If applicable (most programmes; except CEF, EUAF, CCEI, UCPM), VAT that
does NOT fall under the above kinds of ineligible VAT can be eligible and
charged under the category of cost to which it relates.
− costs incurred during the suspension of the implementation of the action
Example: Action is suspended and one of the beneficiaries continues working on it after
the date of the suspension
− in-kind contributions for free (these are not a cost for the beneficiary; except in
HE where they can be charged as eligible costs; see Article 6.1)
− costs declared under another EU grant (i.e. double funding), except for
‘Synergies actions’ or operating grants
This includes:
− costs funded directly by other EU programmes managed by the European
Commission or EU executive agencies
− costs managed/funded/awarded by Member States but co-funded from
the EU budget (e.g. Structural Funds, RRF, etc)
− costs for grants awarded/funded/managed by other EU, international or
national bodies and co-funded with EU funds (e.g. joint undertakings,
Article 185 TFEU bodies)
− costs or contributions for staff of a national (or regional/local) administration, for
activities that are part of the administration’s normal activities (i.e. not
undertaken only because of the grant) cannot be charged to the project.
However, if additional otherwise normal activities are implemented directly and
specifically for the project, such cost can be declared, even if they are the same
kind of activities as the administration’s normal tasks. These must be activities
that are implemented due to the action and either additional in quality (different
in nature or conditions) or quantity (more than usual), to the normal operations
of the national (or regional/local) administration.
Example: Giving a fine for speed excess may be considered as a normal activity of
the police, but if this is done in a specific place for a specific time due to the
implementation of a LIFE project testing new speed limits to improve air quality, they
are different in quality and/or quantity to what the police would have done otherwise
and therefore directly and specifically implemented for the action.
144EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− costs or contributions (especially travel and subsistence) for staff or
representatives of EU institutions, bodies or agencies
− for restricted calls due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security
reasons (HE, DEP, EDF and CEF-DIG): costs or contributions for activities that do
not take place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions — unless approved by the granting authority
− cost declared specifically ineligible in the call conditions.
2. Declaration of ineligible costs or contributions
If a participant declares ineligible costs or contributions in a financial statement, they will be
rejected by the granting authority (see Article 27).
Specific cases (ineligible costs):
Partially deductible VAT — Some entities have a mixed VAT regime, meaning that they
carry out VAT exempt or out-of-the-scope activities AND VAT taxed activities. When VAT paid
on goods or services by these entities cannot be directly allocated to one or the other
category of activities, it will be partially deductible. Therefore it will also be partially eligible.
The eligible part corresponds to the pro-rata of the VAT which is not deductible for that
entity.
In these cases, the beneficiary uses a provisional (estimated) deduction ratio during the year.
The final ratio is only determined at the end of the financial year. The beneficiary must
regularise VAT when closing its accounts. Therefore, the beneficiary must also regularize the
VAT costs declared for the grant (by declaring, in the next reporting period, an adjustment
for the difference between the provisional deduction ratio and the final ratio).
VAT incurred in non-EU countries — VAT which cannot be refunded in third countries may
be considered eligible under certain conditions. The beneficiaries must be able to show that
their request for exemption has been rejected by the competent authorities or the applicable
legislation which stipulate that VAT cannot be refunded.
If a beneficiary receives a VAT refund after the receipt of the final payment, it needs to
inform the granting authority which may recover amounts unduly paid.
Non-identifiable VAT in foreign invoices — In exceptional cases where the beneficiary
cannot identify the VAT charged by the supplier (e.g. small non-EU invoices), the full
purchase price can be recorded in the accounts if it is not possible to deduct/refund the VAT.
That VAT would therefore be eligible.
Duties — The eligibility of duties depends on the eligibility of the cost item to which they are
linked (i.e. in whose price they are included). If the item is eligible, the duty is also eligible.
Combining EU Synergy actions — Different EU grants can be combined if the combined
actual funding rate over all eligible costs of the project does not go above 100% AND the
grant is flagged as ‘Synergy action’ (see Data Sheet, Point 1). If the synergy is not already
coordinated by the granting authorities from the outset (as a ‘Synergy call’, i.e. coordinated
call by both granting authorities with combined fixed funding rates that do not go above
100%; see also Article 3), the beneficiaries need to inform the granting authorities if they
apply for and receive more than one source of EU funding for the action. To prevent double
funding and subsequent cost rejections and recoveries, the granting authorities will assess
adaptations of the action(s) on a case-by-case basis (this may include partitioning of the
action, rejection/reduction of eligible cost, etc).
Best practice: If you notice that your grant is not flagged as ‘Synergy action’ although it
should be, contact the granting authority to see if it is possible to make an amendment.
145EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Combining EU actions with the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) actions —
Except in very exceptional circumstances (see below) EU grants can NOT be combined with
RRF actions because the funding model of the RRF (which finances milestones and targets
without direct connection to individual project costs) makes it normally not possible to
combine RRF funding with other EU funding for the same set of activities (and costs). If the
same project should nonetheless receive funding from an EU programme and the RRF, the
project must be designed as separate actions, clearly delineated and separated for each part
(without overlaps of activities (and costs)).
In exceptional cases where it is established that an ex-ante cost delineation is not feasible or
excessively burdensome, the granting authority may agree to allow combining support from
the RRF and other directly managed programmes on a pro-rata basis (i.e. combined support
for the same project) as a last resort under certain strict conditions.23 One of these conditions
is that the combined support (i.e. grant from the directly managed programme + RRF Grant)
does not exceed the eligible costs under the directly managed programme.
This implies that the EU granting authority will need to check and verify at the level of the
beneficiary how much RRF funding the project received and lower the amount of the EU grant
(by either lowering the requested grant amount or rejecting costs) where the combined RRF
support and directly managed EU grant exceed 100% of the eligible costs under the EU
managed grant. Where the support from the directly managed programme takes the form of
a lump sum, the eligible costs will be assumed to be those that were accepted during grant
preparation and which were used as the basis for defining the lump sum amount in the EU
grant agreement.
Combining of EU action and operating grants — EU action grants can be combined with
EU operating grants if the beneficiaries are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that the
operating grant does not cover any costs which are already covered by the action grants, in
particular indirect costs already covered by the action grant). If cost separation cannot be
demonstrated, beneficiaries can still keep both grants, but must renounce to the flat-rate on
indirect cost in the action grant (since the indirect cost are already considered to be covered
by the operating grant). For detailed conditions, see Article 6.2.E.
Example: Operating grants are grants awarded to support the running costs of certain institutions
pursuing an aim of European interest, such as: College of Europe, European standards bodies
(CEN, CENELEC, ETSI).

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES
AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS
General > Article 7 — Beneficiaries
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting authority for
implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance with all the
obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action under their own
responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated entities or other participants (see
Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the beneficiaries fails to
implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure that this part is implemented by
someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the maximum grant amount and subject to an
amendment; see Article 39). The financial responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed
by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding the grant for the
entire duration of the action. Costs and contributions will be eligible only as long as the beneficiary and the
action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any events or
circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the implementation of the action (see
Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the pre-financing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if
required; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article 21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority under the
Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their affiliated
entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and the granting
authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies otherwise, and in
particular:
147EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- submit the pre-financing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify their quality
and completeness before passing them on to the granting authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other beneficiaries
(report on the distribution of payments; if required, see Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other beneficiaries
without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary or third
party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii) last indent and
(iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have created or which are controlled by or
affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance
with the obligations under the Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’33 (or similar, such as European research infrastructure
consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to one of their members. The
coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-ordination, to ensure that
the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written
consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of recoveries (if
any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article 16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION for programmes with linked actions: [OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked actions, the
beneficiaries must have arrangements with the participants of the other action, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written
collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the consortium is the same, as part of
their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
33 For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy the criteria for being awarded a
grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the
purpose of implementing the action financed by the grant.”
148EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of outputs,
common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy activities, common
communication and dissemination activities, sharing of information, access to background and
results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in both actions.
The arrangements with the participants of the other action must not contain any provision contrary to this
Agreement.] ]
1. Division of roles and responsibilities — Responsibilities towards the granting
authority — Technical and financial responsibility for the action
The beneficiaries are formal parties to the Grant Agreement (they sign the Grant Agreement
or Accession Forms). They have direct contractual obligations under the Grant Agreement
and are fully responsible for implementing the action properly (see Article 11).
This means that:
− each beneficiary must ensure that it complies with its obligations under the Grant
Agreement
− each beneficiary must ensure swift and proper implementation of the action (i.e. that
there are no delays and that the work is done properly)
− each beneficiary is responsible (towards the granting authority) for the tasks
performed by its subcontractors, affiliated entities and associated partners
− the granting authority is NOT responsible for the implementation of the action and has
NO responsibility for the way in which the action is conducted (or any adverse
consequences).
The beneficiaries are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. This
means that they (and any new beneficiaries added later on during the project through an
amendment) accept that they are together responsible for fully implementing the whole
project.
If one of the beneficiaries leaves the action (irrespective of the reason), the remaining
partners must carry out the action as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1)
— including the part of the defaulting beneficiary. They will have to do this without any
additional funding. The Grant Agreement will have to be amended, in order to redistribute the
tasks, terminate the beneficiary’s participation, and/or add a new beneficiary (see Article 39).
Example: Beneficiaries A, B and C have signed a Grant Agreement with a duration of three years
with the Commission in order to carry out an action. One year later, beneficiary C goes bankrupt.
Beneficiaries A and B remain fully responsible to implement the whole action, including the tasks
of C. A and B must agree that one (or both) take over the part of beneficiary C (or ensure
replacement by adding a new beneficiary), to make sure that the entire action is implemented as
described in Annex 1.
From a financial point of view, each participant is in principle responsible for the proper and
sound financial management of their part of the grant. In case of recoveries, there may
however, depending on the programme and Grant Agreement, be certain situations where
beneficiaries may be held responsible for their partners (financial liability):
149EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): the financial liability is as
follows:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation, but not intervene to recover this money (no debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole
amount that needs to be recovered (i.e. paid back to the granting authority)—
even if it has not been the final recipient of the concerned amount (debit note);
if the coordinator does not pay (irrespective of the reason), the granting
authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, drawing on the pre-
financing guarantee, joint and several liability of other beneficiaries or affiliated
entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see Article 22.4)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): each beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle
limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by their affiliated
entities. It is only for the contribution to the MIM that financial responsibility is
shared:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation and, if the beneficiary doesn’t pay, the granting authority may call
on the MIM to intervene and then start a recovery procedure against the
beneficiary for the account of the MIM (debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the contribution to the MIM will be used to
cover recoveries (if any); if the contribution is not sufficient, the coordinator
will be asked to pay back the amount owed (as representative of the
consortium); if the debt is not paid but the report on the distribution of
payments was provided, the granting authority will calculate the share of the
debt per beneficiary and confirm the amount to be recovered from each of
them separately (debit note); if they do not pay (irrespective of the reason),
the granting authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, joint and
several liability of affiliated entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see
Article 22.4); if the report on the distribution of payments was NOT provided,
the granting authority will enforce recovery against the coordinator (debit
note); if needed, the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and
will then continue recovery for the account of the MIM (second debit note
replacing the first)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note); no MIM intervention (new for 2021-
2027).
Beneficiaries are always liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities (see Article
22.2).
2. Division of roles and responsibilities — Roles and responsibilities within the
consortium
The general division of roles and responsibilities within the consortium is as follows:
− the coordinator must coordinate and manage the grant and is the central contact point
for the granting authority
150EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the beneficiaries and other participants must all together contribute to a smooth and
successful implementation of the grant (i.e. contribute to the proper implementation
of the action, comply with their own obligations under the Grant Agreement and
support the coordinator in his obligations).
All communication with the granting authority should in principle go through the coordinator.
Documents/information should be submitted via the coordinator — unless, for specific cases,
the granting authority requests individual partners to provide such information directly (e.g.
in case of an audit, the beneficiaries must submit the documents requested directly to the
auditors, see Article 25).
Other participants (i.e. affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors, etc) may be
part of the consortium, if this is considered useful by the beneficiaries. It is generally
recommended to involve all entities that are important for the successful implementation of
the project, independently of their formal role in the grant.
3. The coordinator’s roles and responsibilities
The coordinator is the central contact point for the granting authority and represents the
consortium (towards the granting authority).
For this purpose, the Grant Agreement imposes a number of specific coordination tasks.
Coordination tasks:
▪ Monitor that the action is implemented properly
▪ Act as the intermediary for all communications — unless the Grant Agreement
specifies otherwise
▪ Request and review documents or information required by the granting authority
and verify their completeness and correctness
▪ Submit the deliverables and reports in the system
▪ Submit the pre-financing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
▪ Distribute payments to the other beneficiaries, without unjustified delay
▪ Inform the granting authority of the amounts paid to each beneficiary, if requested
to do so (see Articles 22 and 32)
The coordination tasks include quality-checking of documents/information submitted by the
beneficiaries, in particular:
− reviewing the individual financial statements from each beneficiary to verify
consistency with the action tasks, as well as completeness and correctness
− verifying that all the requested documents/information have been provided by the
beneficiary (e.g. the use of resources, etc)
− verifying that the beneficiary submits the documents/information in the requested
format
− verifying that the technical information submitted by a beneficiary concerns its action
tasks as described in Annex 1 (and not something unrelated to the action).
The coordinator is not, however, obliged to verify the eligibility of the costs declared, nor to
request justifications. Each beneficiary/affiliated entity remains responsible for the cost it
declares (both as regards eligibility and as regards sufficient records and supporting
documents to substantiate them).
151EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The coordination tasks listed above can NOT be subcontracted or outsourced to another
entity including other beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, or associated partners.
They can only be delegated, under certain circumstances, to entities with ‘authorisation to
administer’ or in the case of ‘sole beneficiaries’ within the meaning of Article 190(2) of the
Financial Regulation 2024/250924 (see below).
By contrast, the coordinator remains free — like any other beneficiary — to use affiliated
entities or subcontractors for other tasks; see Articles 8 and 9.3).
Specific cases (coordinator responsibilities):
‘Entities with authorisation to administer’ — Coordinators that are public bodies may
exceptionally delegate coordination tasks (e.g. the administration of the payments) to
another entity, if this is their usual practice (e.g. a foundation).
For the handling of such coordinator tasks, this other entity must fulfil the following
conditions:
− it must participate as an affiliated entity of the coordinator
and
− it must have been granted an ‘authorisation to administer’ in order to handle the
coordinator’s administrative affairs (and those must include receiving and
administering EU funds).
In this case, the bank account number to be provided by the coordinator during grant
preparation must be that of the entity with the authorisation to administer. The payments will
then be transferred directly to it and it will have to distribute them for the coordinator.
Since they participate as affiliated entity, the entity must be registered in the Participant
Register (have a PIC) and be validated by the Central Validation Service.
The coordinator will remain fully responsible for the entity under the Grant Agreement. For
detailed guidance, see the specific cases in Article 8.
‘Sole beneficiaries’ (or similar, e.g. ERICs25) — Entities which form one joint entity for the
purpose of implementing the action and all comply with the eligibility criteria can participate
as ‘sole beneficiaries’ in EU actions (see Article 190(2) FR 2024/250926). Coordinators which
are sole beneficiaries (or similar, e.g. European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERICs))
and do not have their own resources may exceptionally delegate the coordination tasks to
one of their members. Coordinators using one of their members remain fully responsible for
them under the Grant Agreement.
Technical/scientific coordination (or similar) — The coordinator within the meaning of
the Grant Agreement is the beneficiary in charge of the (administrative) coordination tasks
set out in this Article. Other kinds of coordination activities, i.e. tasks not listed in this Article
(e.g. of technical or scientific nature) can be carried out by any other participant.
These participants may internally (i.e. within the consortium) be called, for example,
‘technical’ or ‘scientific coordinator’, but they will NOT be considered coordinator in the
meaning of the Grant Agreement and are not subject to the rules in Article 7.
24 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(2) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
25 Council Regulation (EC) No 723/2009 of 25 June 2009 on the Community legal framework for a European
Research Infrastructure Consortium (OJ L 206, 08.08.2009, p.1).
26 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(2) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
152EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs for this type of technical/scientific coordination are eligible, if they comply with the
eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.
4. Internal arrangements between beneficiaries — Consortium agreement
The participants should (mandatory for multi-beneficiary grants, if required in the Data
Sheet) conclude a consortium agreement to ensure a smooth and successful action
implementation.
The ‘consortium agreement’ is an agreement between members of the consortium, to set out
their internal arrangements for implementing the project and the administration of the EU
grant. It is purely internal; it should NOT be submitted to the granting authority for
information or review; the granting authority is NOT party and has NO responsibility for it
(nor for any adverse consequences).
Best practice: In view of their importance for avoiding disputes and ensuring a smooth
implementation of the grant, we strongly recommend that every consortium sets up a
consortium agreement, even if not mandatory in the Data Sheet. In any case, the
beneficiaries need to put in place all necessary arrangements regarding their operation and
co-ordination to ensure the proper implementation of the action.
The consortium agreement should complement the Grant Agreement and must NOT contain
any provision contrary to it (or the applicable EU, international or national law).
It should in principle be negotiated and concluded before grant signature (i.e. each
beneficiary should sign the consortium agreement before signing the Accession Form to
accede to the Grant Agreement). Otherwise, there is usually a serious risk that prolonged
disagreement jeopardises the action. Of course, the consortium agreement does not have to
remain the same during the lifetime of the action, it can be modified by the consortium at
any moment.
The duration should at least cover the time until the final payment, however, a longer or
open-ended duration, where relevant, should be considered in order to fully cover any issues
that may emerge after the final payment, such as exploitation of the results (e.g. licensing),
issues arising from audits, etc.
The agreement must be in writing. It may be a simple written agreement or take some other
form (e.g. a notarial deed or part of the statutes of a separate legal entity, such as a
European Economic Interest Grouping, association or joint venture).
For guidance on consortium agreements, see How to draw up your consortium agreement. This
document has been developed for H2020 actions (MFF 2014-2020), but it can also serve for
inspiration in other EU programmes and for the new MFF 2021-2027. In case of questions, please
contact the granting authority.
5. Relationship with beneficiaries of linked actions — Collaboration agreement
The participants of linked actions must make arrangements to determine and coordinate
implementation in the areas where close collaboration is needed and should conclude a
collaboration agreement (mandatory if required in the Data Sheet), to ensure that linked
actions are implemented and coordinated properly.
‘Collaboration agreement’ are agreements between the participants of linked actions to
coordinate their work. The granting authority is not party and has NO responsibility for them
(nor for any adverse consequences). If the consortium in the linked actions is the same, the
collaboration agreement may be included as part of the consortium agreement.
The collaboration agreement should complement the Grant Agreement and must NOT contain
any provision contrary to it (or the applicable EU, international or national law).
153EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
It should set out the details on the collaboration and synchronisation of the activities as well
as on the internal organisation and decision processes of the linked actions. If considered
useful, it can also foresee common boards and advisory structures. These will complement
the governance of each of the linked actions; they can NOT replace the consortium and other
project governance mechanisms that are required for the EU action (if applicable).
For guidance on collaboration agreements, see How to draw up your collaboration agreement.
This document has been developed for H2020 actions (MFF 2014-2020), but it can also serve for
inspiration in other EU programmes and for the new MFF 2021-2027. In case of questions, please
contact the granting authority.
154EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 8 — Affiliated entities
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
[OPTION 1 for programmes without affiliated entities: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with affiliated entities (standard): [OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The
following entities which are linked to a beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘affiliated entities’:
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short name)]
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short name)]
[same for more AE]
Affiliated entities can charge costs and contributions to the action under the same conditions as the
beneficiaries and must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in accordance with Article
11.
Their costs and contributions will be included in Annex 2 and will be taken into account for the calculation of
the grant.
The beneficiaries must ensure that all their obligations under this Agreement also apply to their affiliated
entities.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the affiliated entities.
Breaches by affiliated entities will be handled in the same manner as breaches by beneficiaries. Recovery of
undue amounts will be handled through the beneficiaries.
If the granting authority requires joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4),
they must sign the declaration set out in Annex 3a and may be held liable in case of enforced recoveries
against their beneficiaries (see Article 22.2 and 22.4).]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable] ]
1. Affiliated entities
Affiliated entities (in some programmes formerly called ‘linked third parties’; new for 2021-
2027) are entities with a (usually legal or capital) link to a beneficiary and which implement
parts of the action and are allowed to charge costs directly to the grant.
They do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA) but can be part of
the consortium and often play an important role in implementing the action. Therefore, the
Grant Agreement mentions them by name and defines their role (rights and obligations).
In practice, they are treated in many ways like beneficiaries (have their own financial
statement, must provide their own CFS, must contribute to the technical report, must submit
deliverables, etc).
Annotations in this AGA which refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to
affiliated entities (just like the provisions of the MGA themselves; see also MGA
Preamble).
For technical and security reasons, affiliated entities do NOT however have direct
access to the Portal My Area section (see Article 36). They therefore always need to go
through their beneficiaries (to sign the declaration of honour, submit financial statements,
contribute to the technical report, etc).
155EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Characteristics of implementation by affiliated entities:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1 (including the
handling of subcontracting, financial support to third parties (FSTP), etc).
▪ They do not charge a ‘price’, but declare their own costs.
▪ The work is and is usually carried out on their premises, under their full and direct
control, instructions and management, with their own employees.
▪ The beneficiary remains responsible towards the granting authority for the work
carried out by its affiliated entities and for the recovery of undue payments from
its affiliated entities (if any).
‘Link to the beneficiaries’ means in particular a legal or capital link, which is neither limited to
the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation (see Article 190(1)(b)
FR 2024/250927). This covers:
− permanent legal structures (e.g. the relationship between an association and its
members)
− contractual cooperation not limited to the action (e.g. an existing collaboration
agreement for activities in a field relevant to the action;)
− capital link, i.e.
− direct or indirect control of the beneficiary
− under the same direct or indirect control as the beneficiary
or
− directly or indirectly controlling the beneficiary.
Moreover, it covers not only the case of parent companies or holdings and their daughter
companies or subsidiaries and vice-versa, but also the case of affiliates between themselves
(e.g. entities controlled by the same entity).
Examples:
1. Company A established in France holding 20% of the shares in Company B established in Italy.
However, with 20% of the shares, it has 60% of the voting rights in company B. Therefore,
company A controls company B and both companies may be affiliated entities.
2. Company X and company Y do not control each other, but they are both owned by company Z.
They are both considered affiliated entities.
3. The Ministry A is in accordance with national law the supervisory authority of a national agency.
They can be considered as affiliated entities. Conversely, if the national agency is by statute set up
as independent from the central government, the agency and the Ministry should instead
participate as separate beneficiaries (or other fitting roles).
4. Associations, foundations or other legal entities composed of members — That entity is generally
the beneficiary and the members are the affiliated entities.
5. Joint Research Units (JRU) (i.e. research laboratories/infrastructures created and owned by two
or more different legal entities in order to carry out research) — They do not have a separate legal
personality, but form a single research unit where staff and resources from the different members
are put together to the benefit of all. Though lacking legal personality, they exist physically, with
27 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(1)(b) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
156EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
premises, equipment, and resources that belong to them. A member of the JRU can be the
beneficiary and other members can participate as affiliated entities. The JRU has to meet all the
following conditions:
− scientific and economic unity
− last a certain length of time
− recognised by a public authority.
It is necessary that the JRU itself is recognised by a public authority, i.e. an entity identified as
such under the applicable national law. The beneficiary must provide to the granting authority, a
copy of the resolution, law, decree, decision, attesting the relationship between the beneficiary and
the affiliated entity(ies), or a copy of the document establishing the joint research unit, or any
other document that proves that research facilities are put in a common structure and correspond
to the concept of scientific and economic unit.
Just like beneficiaries, affiliated entities must normally fulfil the conditions for participation
and funding.
Example: Company A established in Germany is a beneficiary in a grant. A owns B, a French
company and also owns C, a company established in a non-EU country not associated to the
programme. B and C may be considered affiliates to A, however only B may participate as
affiliated entity to A, because company C is established in a non-associated third country and is
therefore not eligible. C can instead participate as an associated partner.
Affiliated entities must be listed in Article 8, their tasks must be mentioned in Annex 1 and
their budget in Annex 2.There is NO simplified approval procedure.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the action tasks done by
affiliated entities (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that the affiliated entities comply with the same obligations as
they themselves (mutatis mutandis).
Obligations that must be extended to affiliated entities:
▪ all obligations (mutatis mutandis)
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
affiliated entities.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the affiliated
entities, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the affiliated
entities, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (affiliated entities):
Joint and several liability of affiliated entities — The granting authority may (during
grant preparation) require joint and several liability of an affiliated entity, if:
− the financial capacity of a beneficiary is ‘weak’ and
− the beneficiary mainly coordinates the work of its affiliated entity.
Examples:
1. The financially weak beneficiary is an association and most of the work is carried out by several
of its members as affiliated entities.
2. The financially weak beneficiary is a small company with a substantial part of its work
implemented by a bigger affiliated entity.
3. The proposal submitted by four independent entities established in four Member States is
positively evaluated. The four successful applicants decide to form a legal entity to simplify the
management of the project. The newly established entity will be the beneficiary, i.e. a new legal
entity. The successful applicants will carry out the work as affiliated entities of the new legal entity.
157EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If requested, the affiliated entity must accept joint and several liability with their beneficiary.
In this case, it must sign a declaration (on paper and in blue-ink, using the Annex 3a
generated by the system) to be submitted by the beneficiary at the moment of its accession
to the grant (or amendment adding the affiliated entity). The affiliated entity must send the
original to the beneficiary (by registered post with proof of delivery), who must upload it (as
a scanned PDF copy) in the system.
The liability is for any amount owned by the beneficiary under the Grant Agreement, and up
to the affiliated entity’s maximum EU contribution in Annex 2.
More details on the financial capacity check are available in the Online Manual > Participant
Register > Financial capacity assessment on the Portal.
Entities created in order to manage administrative/financial tasks (including
‘entities with authorisation to administer’) — These are typically legal entities
(foundations, spin-off companies, etc), created or controlled by a beneficiary (usually a public
body like a university/ministry) to handle the financial and administrative aspects of the
beneficiaries’ involvement e.g. in EU actions.
If they handle coordinator tasks (see Article 7) or implement action tasks themselves, they
have to participate as affiliated entity of the beneficiary/coordinator and have to declare their
own costs.
Resources they put at the disposal of their beneficiary for the action implementation should in
principle also be charged by them as affiliated entity.
However, for HE, in case different funding rates are applied for the beneficiary versus the
affiliated entity, the costs can also be declared by the beneficiary:
− if the resources are provided against payment: in accordance with rules of the
appropriate cost category (e.g. Article 6.2.A.3 for personnel put at the disposal of the
beneficiary; Article 6.2.C.2 for equipment or Article 6.2.C.3 for other goods, works and
services)
− if the resources are provided for free: in accordance with the rules on eligibility of in-
kind contributions (see Article 6.1).
Best practice: It is recommended to describe in the DoA Annex 1 the relation between the
beneficiary and the foundation/spin-off and its impact on the Grant Agreement.

9.1 Associated partners
[OPTION 1 for programmes without associated partners: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with associated partners (standard): [OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The
following entities which cooperate with a beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘associated partners’:
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number] [associated partner of [BEN legal name (short
name)]]
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number] [associated partner of [BEN legal name (short

[same for more AP]
Associated partners must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in accordance with Article
11. They may not charge costs or contributions to the action and the costs for their tasks are not eligible.
The tasks must be set out in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their contractual obligations under Articles 11 (proper implementation),
12 (conflict of interests), 13 (confidentiality and security), 14 (ethics), 17.2 (visibility), 18 (specific rules for
carrying out action), 19 (information) and 20 (record-keeping) also apply to the associated partners.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the associated partners.]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable] ]
1. Associated partners
Associated partners are entities that implement action tasks, but without receiving EU
funding.
They do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign an accession form), but they
implement parts of the action and are thus often involved actively in the consortium.
Therefore, the Grant Agreement mentions them by name and defines their role (rights and
obligations).
Characteristics of implementation by associated partners:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ They participate at own costs (do not receive EU funding).
▪ The consortium (or, in case the associated partner cooperates with a specific
beneficiary as named in Article 9.1, that beneficiary) remains responsible towards
the granting authority for the work performed by the associated partners.
Associated partners do NOT need to have a (capital or legal) link to any beneficiary (but they
may have one).
159EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Since they do not receive EU funding, associated partners do NOT have to comply with the
eligibility conditions (but they may)).
Associated partners must be listed in Article 9.1, their tasks must be mentioned in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the tasks implemented by
associated partners (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations:
Obligations that must be extended to associated partners:
▪ Proper implementation (see Article 11), including compliance with call conditions
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific9 rules for the action implementation (see Article 18), including
compliance with specific rules set out in Annex 5
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
associated partners (e.g. via contractual arrangements, consortium agreement, etc).
The beneficiaries must also ensure that the associated partners respect the call conditions
and Annex 5.
Example: In Horizon Europe, the Grant Agreement provides for additional obligations in Annex 5
regarding results, e.g. open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications which applies to all such
publications under the Grant Agreement, including publications where associated partners are
involved.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
associated partners, particular concerning the action implementation.

9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions
[OPTION 1 for programmes with in-kind contributions allowed but not eligible (standard):
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods,
works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge), if necessary for the implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not charge costs or
contributions to the action and the costs for the in-kind contributions are not eligible.
The third parties and their in-kind contributions should be set out in Annex 1.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with in-kind contributions eligible:
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods,
works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge) if necessary for the implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not charge costs or
contributions to the action, but the costs for the in-kind contributions are eligible and may be charged by the
beneficiaries which use them, under the conditions set out in Article 6. The costs will be included in Annex 2
as part of the beneficiaries’ costs.
The third parties and their in-kind contributions should be set out in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the third parties giving in-kind contributions. ]
[OPTION 3 for programmes with in-kind contributions not allowed:
In-kind contributions (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods and services, etc. given by third parties free-of-
charge) are not allowed for the implementation of the action.]
1. Third parties providing in-kind contributions: In-kind contributions allowed but
not eligible
This is the standard rule for most EU programmes. Beneficiaries may use in-kind
contributions provided by third parties, if necessary to implement the action, but they are not
counted towards the project budget (not eligible costs).
Examples (in-kind contributions allowed but not eligible):
1. Civil servant working as a professor in a public university is also working on the action. His salary
is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but by the government (the ministry). It can therefore
not be charged to the EU grant.
2. A entity providing learning spaces for free to the beneficiaries, for example a municipality for an
NGO part of the project.
3. A graphic company providing for free the design of booklets.
In-kind contributions refers only to the case where a third party makes available some
of its resources to a beneficiary for free (i.e. without any payment; new for 2021-2027). In
this case, the beneficiary itself makes no payment and there is therefore NO cost incurred by
the beneficiary. There are therefore normally NO costs that can be charged to the action (—
unless specifically provided for in the Programme Regulation, e.g. for HE).
By contrast, if there is any payment by the beneficiary to the third party for the in-kind
contribution provided, the beneficiary can declare the costs in the appropriate cost category:
− personnel costs for seconded persons (see Article 6.2.A.3)
− renting costs for equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2) or
− purchase costs for other goods, works and services (see Article 6.2.C.3).
161EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Third parties providing in-kind contributions: In-kind contributions eligible
For some EU programmes (only HE), the Programme Regulation (basic act) allows in-kind
contribution costs to be charged to the action.
Examples (in-kind contributions eligible): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university is also working on the action. His salary is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but
by the government (the ministry). In Horizon Europe, the beneficiary may charge these costs to the
grant, even if they are incurred by a third party (the ministry/government).
The eligibility conditions for such costs are set out in Article 6.1. However, in kind
contributions against payment ARE NOT a budget category: Depending on the type of cost,
they must be declared in, and comply with, the fitting budget category (e.g. personnel costs,
equipment).
In-kind contributions and the third parties contributing them must be mentioned in Annex 1
(simplified approval procedure; see below).
Moreover, if in-kind contributions are charged to the action, the beneficiaries must also
ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, the European Court
of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks,
reviews, audits and investigations on the third parties, and in particular to audit their costs. If
access is denied by the third party, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (in-kind contributions eligible):
Simplified approval procedure (new in-kind contributions) — For programmes where
in-kind contributions are eligible (only HE), if the need for an in-kind contribution was not
known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to introduce
the new contribution into the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure; for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the
beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting authority might not approve the new
contribution and reject the costs at interim or final payment-stage later on.

9.3 Subcontractors
9.3 Subcontractors
[OPTION 1 for programmes without subcontractors (ineligible): Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with subcontractors (standard): Subcontractors may participate in the action, if
necessary for the implementation.
Subcontractors must implement their action tasks in accordance with Article 11. The costs for the
subcontracted tasks (invoiced price from the subcontractor) are eligible and may be charged by the
beneficiaries, under the conditions set out in Article 6. The costs will be included in Annex 2 as part of the
beneficiaries’ costs.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their contractual obligations under Articles 11 (proper implementation),
12 (conflict of interest), 13 (confidentiality and security), 14 (ethics), 17.2 (visibility), 18 (specific rules for
carrying out action), 19 (information) and 20 (record-keeping) also apply to the subcontractors.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the subcontractors. ]
1. Subcontractors
Subcontractors do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA), but they
often implement important parts of the action (i.e. action tasks specified in Annex 1) and
thus may need to be involved actively in the consortium. Therefore, the Grant Agreement
mentions them and defines their role (rights and obligations).
Characteristics of subcontractors:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ charges a price, which usually includes a profit (— this distinguishes it from
affiliated entities; see Article 8), to be declared as subcontracting costs by a
beneficiary.
▪ The work is carried out without the direct supervision of the beneficiary and is not
hierarchically subordinate to the beneficiary (— this distinguishes it from action
tasks implemented by in-house consultants; see Article 6.2.A.2).
▪ The motivation is pecuniary, not the work on the project itself. The subcontractor
is paid by the beneficiary in exchange for its work.
▪ The beneficiary remains fully responsible towards the granting authority for action
tasks performed by its subcontractors.
Example (subcontract): A Grant Agreement for an action on nature reserves describes in
Annex 1 two action tasks. The first task concerns a comparative study of water quality in the
reserve, which the beneficiary’s employee will compile after taking and sending water samples
to laboratories. The lab work is necessary for the implementation of the action but only a
subactivity of compiling the study (the action task), therefore it will fall under purchase costs
(see Article 6.2.C). The second task concerns an aerial survey of the water bodies for which the
beneficiary does not have the necessary know-how and assets and therefore subcontracts to a
service provider who will implement the survey (the action task) through activities like aerial
photography and analysis.
163EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The action tasks to be subcontracted and the estimated costs (not necessarily the
subcontractor, especially if not known yet) must be identified and justified in Annex 1 (Article
6.2.B; simplified approval procedure; see below).
Normally you are NOT obliged to give information about the names of the subcontractors
selected (in DoA Annex 1 or periodic report), but many programmes require this information
indirectly through the detailed budget/cost reporting table.
Best practice: If you think that there is an issue with a subcontractor that might impact the
eligibility of subcontracting costs (e.g. potential conflict of interest; subcontractor not in
compliance with the call conditions or subject to sanctions, etc), inform the granting
authority and ask for specific guidance.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the subcontracted action
tasks by the subcontractors (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations:
Obligations that must be extended to subcontractors:
▪ Proper implementation (see Article 11), including compliance with call conditions
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18), including
compliance with specific rules set out in Annex 5
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
subcontractors (e.g. via contractual arrangements, consortium agreement, etc).
The beneficiaries must also ensure that the subcontractors respect the the call conditions and
Annex 5.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
subcontractors, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
subcontractor, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (subcontractors):
Simplified approval procedure (new subcontracts) — If the need for a subcontract was
not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to
introduce the subcontracting of one or more tasks in Annex 1 (see Article 39) or, if allowed,
flag it in the periodic report (simplified approval procedure; allowed for most programmes;
for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk that the
granting authority might not approve the new subcontracting of the task(s) and reject the
costs at interim or final payment-stage later on.

Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the recipients.]
1. Recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)
Recipients of financial support to third parties (grants, prizes or other) do not become party
to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA) and are not part of the consortium. They do not
implement action tasks, but they benefit from them and receive (indirectly) a part of the EU
funding. Therefore, the Grant Agreement defines their role (rights and obligations).
Characteristics of FSTP recipients:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They do not perform action tasks, but the financial support given to them is part of
an action task specified in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ They receive financial support from the grant (e.g. sub-grant or prize money), to
be declared as financial support to third parties cost by a beneficiary.
The beneficiaries remain responsible towards the granting authority for the proper use of the
funding by the recipients.
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations, where
relevant/applicable based on the nature of the action:
Obligations that must be extended to FSTP recipients:
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding, as appropriate (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18)
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
165EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the

Moreover, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office

recipients, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
recipient, the costs will be rejected.

consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. Non-EU participants
Non-EU participants are not a separate category of participants, but simply participants (e.g.
beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner, subcontractor) that are not legally
established in one of the EU Member States. They can usually participate in EU funding
programmes, if:
− their country is associated to the programme (so-called ‘associated country’) —
standard case
OR
− if the programme is open to participation and funding of entities from third countries
— rare (e.g. HE, RELEX).
Since non-EU participants are normally not subject to EU law, the Grant Agreement recalls
the most important principles and makes them contractually binding. Thus, participants
undertake to comply with all their obligations under the Grant Agreement and commit to:
− respect key principles, such as fundamental rights, EU values and ethical principles,
environmental and labour standards, security of information rules, respect for IPR
protection and privacy
− use appropriate audit standards as well as qualified and independent external auditors
− allow for checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the bodies mentioned in Article
25 (e.g. granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-
Fraud Office (OLAF))
167EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Moreover, since non-EU participants are regularly located outside the jurisdiction of the EU
courts (General Court, Court of Justice), disputes will be settled by the courts of Brussels,
Belgium (— unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU court
judgments).
Specific cases (non-EU participants):
International organisations (IOs) — International organisations do NOT fall under Article
10.1 (nor under the option for non-EU participants in the declaration of honour (DoH) to be
signed before grant signature), since they do NOT count as participants from non-EU
countries.
Formally speaking, place of establishment of international organisations is irrelevant and for
the purposes of the Grant Agreement they are considered as neither EU nor non-EU entities.
They have a special status (supra-national)and are covered specifically by the provisions of
Article 10.2.
If an international organisation is pillar-assessed, the provisions of Article 10.3 apply in
addition.

organisations (IOs; if any) undertake to comply with their obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical principles,
environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information, intellectual property rights,
visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use either independent public officers or
external auditors which comply with comparable standards as those set out in EU Directive
2006/43/EC35
- for the controls under Article 25: to allow for the checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the
bodies mentioned in that Article, taking into account the specific agreements concluded by them
and the EU (if any).
For such participants, nothing in the Agreement will be interpreted as a waiver of their privileges or
immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or international law.
Special rules on applicable law and dispute settlement apply (see Article 43 and Data Sheet, Point 5).]
35 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and
consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. International organisations (IOs)
International organisations are not a separate category of participants, but simply
participants (e.g. beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner, subcontractor) with a
specific legal form and status under international public law and validated as such in the
Participant Register.
Examples: International organisations are for example UN organisations and specialised
agencies (e.g. WHO, UNHCR, UNEP, UNESCO), ESA, ECMWF, OCCAR.
They can usually participate in EU funding programmes, unless the programme explicitly
provides otherwise (e.g. in HE, international European research organisations (IEROs) can
always participate with funding, while other international organisations can participate with
funding only under certain circumstances set out in the work programme/call conditions).
Since international organisations are normally not subject to EU law, the Grant Agreement
recalls the most important principles and obligations regarding audits and controls and makes
them contractually binding.
In addition, Article 10.2 acknowledges that nothing in the Grant Agreement will be
interpreted as a waiver of the privileges and immunities set out in their constituent
documents and recognized under international law.
Thus, for instance,:
− enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU or decisions on administrative sanctions
(i.e. exclusion or financial penalties; see Articles 22 and 34) will normally not be
directed at international organisations
169EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− international organisations agree with the granting authority on the applicable law that
should apply to the Grant Agreement (including no applicable law; see Article 43.1).
− dispute settlement is normally not brought before national or EU courts but referred to
the Permanent Court of Arbitration (see Article 43.2).
Additional specific rules apply moreover if the international organisation is also pillar-
assessed (see Article 10.3).

10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
[OPTION 1 for programmes without pillar-assessed entities: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with pillar-assessed entities: Pillar-assessed participants (if any) may rely on
their own systems, rules and procedures, in so far as they have been positively assessed and do not call into
question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and procedures which
participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control system, accounting system, external
audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and exclusion, information on recipients and protection of
personal data; see Article 157 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in
particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards, rules and
procedures
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in accordance with usual
accounting practices
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, pre-financing guarantees are not needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their regular internal
or external auditors and in accordance with their internal financial regulations and
procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if those practices
are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no recovery if
the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue amounts from the third party
receiving the support (including legal proceedings) and non-recovery is not due to an error or
negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be conducted taking into
account the rules and procedures specifically agreed between them and the framework
agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the participant’s internal
rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment will be
calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for execution only after
termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into before the pre-information letter was
received and could not reasonably be terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated for damage it
sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not
implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the damage is due to an
infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures or due to a violation of third
parties’ rights by the participant or one of its employees or individual for whom the employees
are responsible.
171EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do purchases,
subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance with their internal rules and
procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal standards, rules
and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of equal treatment of
applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use), communication,
dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- specific rules for carrying out the action (Article 18)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems, rules and
procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules and procedures
that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU, may moreover —
under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach
the principle of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries) — rely on provisions set out in that framework
agreement. ]
1. Pillar-assessed entities
Pillar-assessed entities are not a separate category of participants not a separate category of
participants, but simply participants (e.g. beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner)
that are also ‘pillar-assessed’.
Article 10.3 applies only to entities with a positive pillar-assessment. Entities with
ongoing pillar-assessment procedures must apply the standard rules under the Grant
Agreement until they fulfil the requirements to benefit from the special status provided for
in Article 10.3 (i.e. having a positive pillar assessment).
The special provisions in Article 10 may apply cumulatively for entities with multiple
statuses. Thus if an international organisation participates in a consortium and is also pillar-
assessed, both Article 10.2 and 10.3 will apply.
172EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The ‘pillar assessment’ is a special ex-ante assessment of the rules, systems and procedures
used for managing funds in accordance with Article 157 of the EU Financial Regulation
2024/250928. It provides the granting authority with assurance that the entity can offer a
similar level of protection of the budget as the Commission when it manages EU funds.
Since the pillar assessment ensures that the granting authority can rely on the systems, rules
and procedures of such entities, they can rely on those systems, rules and procedures also
for the grant, provided that:
− the systems, rules and procedures used have actually been positively assessed
Example: An entity has been pillar-assessed but the auditors had material findings regarding
the internal audit capacity leading to a negative internal control pillar result. In this case, the
granting authority cannot rely on the entity’s own rules in this respect and the entity cannot use
its own internal auditors to draw up the CFS for the activities under the Grant Agreement.
− the application of own systems, rules and procedures does not call into question the
decision awarding the grant and does not lead to a breach of the principle of equal
treatment.
Thus, if pillar-assessed entities apply in a call for proposals they must comply with all the call
conditions (IPR protection, security, ethics, etc) and the provisions of the Grant Agreement
(rules on electronic management and communication, reporting and monitoring, payment
arrangements, etc), even if these might not be in line with their internal practice (pillar-
assessed or not). The rules of the pillar-assessed entity can therefore only be used, if they do
not contradict the conditions set out in the call or the Grant Agreement.
Examples:
1. Financial support to third parties (FSTP): A beneficiary has been positively assessed for the
grants pillar. Normally, it could therefore rely on its own rules and procedures when giving FSTP in
the form of grants. However, if the call conditions stipulate specific criteria for the provision of
FSTP (e.g. because these are necessary to achieve the objectives of the call) then the pillar-
assessed entity has to follow the criteria provided for in the call, irrespective of its own positively-
assessed practices. The application of other rules would call into question the award decision since
the FSTP would not comply with the conditions of the call.
2. Subcontracting: A beneficiary has been positively assessed for the procurement pillar.
Normally, it could therefore rely on its own rules and procedures for e.g. subcontracting. However,
if the call conditions stipulate specific security provisions for subcontracting to protect the EU
security interests (e.g. the exclusion of contractors not established in EU Member States) then the
pillar-assessed entity has to follow the criteria provided for in the call irrespective of its own
positively-assessed practices, its own membership etc. The application of other rules would put the
EU security interests at risk and would thus call into question the award decision.
If the pillar assessment resulted in findings that require remedial measures (i.e. ‘supervisory
measures’ in the meaning of Article 157(3) EU Financial Regulation 2024/250929) for certain
pillars, the pillar-assessed entity must apply these remedial measures, mutatis mutandis,
also for the grant (if it would like to rely on its own systems, rules and procedures).
Example: A pillar-assessed entity is a beneficiary in a Grant Agreement that requires the provision
of financial support to third parties (FSTP) in the form of grants and the subsequent publication of
recipient information. The entity has been positively assessed in the grants pillar; however, the
auditors had findings in the publication pillar. If the Commission therefore imposes supervisory
measures requiring the pillar-assessed entity to publish regularly all grant recipients that profit
from EU funds on the entity’s website, the pillar-assessed entity will have to follow this measure
also for the financial support to third parties given under the Grant Agreement, if it intends to rely
on its own systems, rules and procedures.

29 [old Financial Regulation: Article 154(3) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
173EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The application of remedial/supervisory measures for failed pillars should not lead to a
situation where the pillar-assessed entity is subject to stricter rules than other participants,
i.e. obligations that go beyond the requirements set out in the Grant Agreement. In this case
the pillar-assessed entity can choose to apply the grant rules instead of the agreed
remedial/supervisory measures.
The granting authority must be immediately informed of any change to the systems, rules
and procedures. If the pillar-assessed entity relies on systems, rules and procedures that
have not been positively assessed, the costs and contributions may be rejected and the grant
reduced.
Specific rules apply in particular with respect to cases of recovery, liability, suspension and
termination owing to the specific nature of pillar-assessed entities (usually public law bodies,
international organisations etc.) and their frame of cooperation with the granting authority.
List of specific rules for pillar-assessed entities:
▪ Recovery: If a pillar-assessed entity provides financial support to third parties
(FSTP) and eventually it turns out (e.g. following a check by the pillar-assessed
entity) that the recipients have received undue amounts, the pillar-assessed entity
should try to recover the undue amounts from the recipients and can do so,
following its own positively assessed rules and procedures. These amounts would
normally be considered as ineligible costs under the Grant Agreement. However, if
despite best efforts by the pillar-assessed entity the undue amounts cannot be
recovered from the recipients, the granting authority will also not recover the
corresponding amount from the pillar-assessed entity (unless the non-recovery is
due to error or negligence on part of the pillar-assessed entity).
▪ Liability: Normally, participants have to compensate the granting authority for
damages they caused in connection to the implementation of action (see Article
33.2). However, pillar-assessed entities will not have to compensate the granting
authority for such damages if the pillar-assessed entity was in compliance with its
own positively-assessed rules and procedures and did not violate the rights of any
third parties.
▪ Suspension: Normally, if the Grant Agreement is suspended, cost incurred during
the suspension period will not be eligible. However, for pillar assessed entities
costs may be eligible even during grant suspension to ensure the resumption of
the action after the suspension and to serve payments under legal commitments
such as purchase and subcontracts which were concluded by the pillar-assessed
entity for the implementation of the action before the pillar-assessed entity was
informed of a possible suspension, provided the payment obligations under these
commitments can themselves not be temporarily stopped (e.g. suspended for the
period of the Grant Agreement suspension).
▪ Termination: Similarly, in case of Grant Agreement termination, pillar-assessed
entities may be reimbursed for (unavoidable) cost for legal commitments such as
purchase- and subcontracts which were concluded by the pillar-assessed entity for
the implementation of the action before information on a possible termination was
received, even if execution of the contracts would only take place after the
payment of the balance. As in the case of suspension, the pillar-assessed entity
has to take all reasonable effort to reduce such cost e.g. by terminating the
contracts at the earliest opportunity.
174EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If there is an applicable framework agreement within the meaning of Article 131 EU Financial
Regulation 2024/2509 (i.e. Financial Framework Partnership Agreement (FFPA))30 concluded
between the European Commission and the pillar-assessed entity, the grant-relevant
provisions in the financial framework partnership agreement may be applied, provided they
do not fall under the list of provisions that would breach the principle of equal treatment or
call into question the decision awarding the grant , e.g. regarding audits.
Record-keeping — If a pillar-assessed entity relies on its own positively-assessed rules for
record-keeping, it must still ensure that these record-keeping rules are in line with obligations
under the Grant Agreement, e.g. record-keeping must be done in a way that allows checks,
reviews and audits (under the rules of a financial framework partnership agreement, if applicable)
and follow the rules for recording of time worked on the action for the calculation of personnel
costs.

SECTION 2 RULES FOR CARRYING OUT THE ACTION
General > Article 11 — Proper implementation of the action
ARTICLE 11 — PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION
ARTICLE 11 — PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION
11.1 Obligation to properly implement the action
The beneficiaries must implement the action as described in Annex 1 and in compliance with the provisions
of the Agreement, the call conditions and all legal obligations under applicable EU, international and national
law.
11.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Proper implementation of the action
The action must be properly implemented, i.e. implemented in accordance with the
beneficiaries’ obligations. These obligations include the obligations stemming explicitly from
the Grant Agreement but also include any other rules applicable to the activities of the
project. The obligations to properly implement the action requires:
− that the action (i.e. the work) must be carried out as described in the description of
the action (DoA; Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement)
− compliance with the provisions of the Agreement (other than those set out in the DoA;
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement)
− compliance with the call conditions as set out in all the documents accompanying the
call for proposals
AND
− compliance with all the applicable provisions of EU, international and national law.
The requirement to properly implement the action is a general obligation to implement the
grant in good faith in compliance with any applicable rules (whether specifically listed in the Grant
Agreement or not) at any step of implementation. It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to be aware
of this and apply it to their project.
The work must be done properly (good quality) and on time. Participants must prevent
delays (or reduce them as much as possible). In addition, important delays should be
immediately signalled to the granting authority (see Article 19).
When implementing the action as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of
the Grant Agreement), all work on the project must comply with the obligations set out in
other parts of the Grant Agreement, in particular the rules for carrying out the action (e.g.
data protection, confidentiality; see also Annex 5).
Example: As part of the activities set out in your description of the action, you are
subcontracting the conduct of a survey. Even though you have to ensure the proper technical
conduct of the survey as described in the action and ensure submission of the deliverable within
the time limits of the action under the terms of the grant, you also have to comply with the rules
176EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
on subcontracting, any applicable data protection rules etc. Otherwise, the granting authority
may reject cost or reduce your grant even if you provided your deliverable in good quality and on
time.
This means in practice that full compliance with all obligations at all time is expected.
Apart from obligations explicitly specified in the Grant Agreement and its Annexes, the
beneficiaries must also comply with the call conditions (e.g. conditions on geographic
eligibility, eligible participants, financial support to third parties (FSTP), specific cost eligibility
rules, etc). These conditions must be fulfilled throughout the implementation of the project.
Example: The call conditions provide that entities subject to EU restrictive measures (also called
‘sanctions’) cannot participate in the grant in any capacity, including as associated partners or
subcontractors.
The granting authorities cannot know in advance and therefore cannot specify all possible
obligations that a beneficiary may have in connection with the activities under the Grant
Agreement. Accordingly the Grant Agreement includes the general obligations to comply with
all the applicable provisions of EU, international and national law (including general
principles, such as fundamental rights, values and ethical principles).
If activities take place in several countries, the participants must comply with the national
law of the country in which they are established AND that of the country (or countries) where
the action is implemented.
Example: Each beneficiary must comply in particular with the labour law applicable to the
personnel working on the action and must fulfil the tax and social obligations related to the
activities it carries out under the applicable national law. If a part of the activities is done in
another country, the applicable rules must be respected.
This obligation also requires compliance with other legal acts and other binding or non-
binding rules and guidance in the area concerned (see definition of ‘Applicable EU,
international and national law’ in Article 2). This includes applicable professional code of
conducts, sectoral guidance, but also covers relevant legal acts such as work programmes
adopted by the granting authority or guidance provided by the granting authority.
Example: Activities in the course of the project may require the involvement of certain
professions whose work is governed by sector- or profession-specific guidelines or codes of
conducts, e.g. in healthcare. The proper implementation of the action would normally oblige the
beneficiary to comply with all such guidelines or codes of conduct in concerned areas of work
(unless the description of the action explicitly requires otherwise, e.g. to test innovative new
methods, within the boundaries of binding rules).
It also includes compliance with relevant legal acts such as the conditions set out in work
programmes adopted by the granting authority and applicable to the action, or any guidance
provided by the granting authority.
Specific cases (proper implementation):
Conflicts between applicable rules — The beneficiaries remain fully responsible to plan
and implement their action in a way that ensures the exercise of the rights by the granting
authority/other EU bodies, including for checks, reviews, audits and investigations. If conflicts
with applicable (e.g. national/third country) rules prevent the exercise of these rights (e.g.
access to records or results) the granting authority may reject costs, reduce the grant or
terminate the participation of the beneficiary (or the Grant Agreement).
Conflicts with security rules — Be aware that national/third country security requirements
(national/third country security classification, national export restrictions, etc) may affect the
project implementation (and even put it at risk). It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to avoid
this and to keep your project free of such restrictions, either by adapting the action or by
obtaining all necessary authorisations to be able to comply with your obligations under the
Grant Agreement (see also specific case above). Any potential security issues should
immediately be notified to the granting authority.
177EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: According to national rules a personnel security clearance (PSC) may be required for
accessing information even below CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL level. If this prevents the
granting authority, ECA, OLAF or EPPO from exercising their rights, the reference to conflicting
national rules will not release the beneficiary from contractual obligations and the granting
authority will take the necessary measures (e.g. rejection of cost due to lack of supporting
documents).
178EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 12 — Conflict of interests
ARTICLE 12 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
ARTICLE 12 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
12.1 Conflict of interests
The beneficiaries must take all measures to prevent any situation where the impartial and objective
implementation of the Agreement could be compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life,
political or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect interest (‘conflict of interests’).
They must formally notify the granting authority without delay of any situation constituting or likely to lead
to a conflict of interests and immediately take all the necessary steps to rectify this situation.
The granting authority may verify that the measures taken are appropriate and may require additional
measures to be taken by a specified deadline.
12.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28)
and the grant or the beneficiary may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Conflict of interests
The beneficiaries must ensure that the action is implemented impartially and objectively, as
described in the Grant Agreement. They must do their best to take all measures to avoid
conflicts of interest. Persons working on the action should in particular:
− refrain from taking any action which may bring them into a situation of conflict of
interests
− take appropriate measures to prevent conflicts of interest from arising in the tasks
under their responsibility
− take appropriate measures to address any situations which may objectively be
perceived as a conflict of interests
AND
− report any conflict of interests, or situations that could be perceived as a conflict of
interests.
Best Practice: It is recommended that the beneficiaries have a system in place that allows (at
least) persons working on the action to declare conflicts of interests and clear rules how to
address such situations. Awareness-raising activities should be carried out regularly.
‘Conflicts of interests’ can negatively affect the action and may lead to a rejection of cost or
grant reduction, in particular if a conflict of interests affects the action’s implementation in
terms of:
− quality, e.g. if a conflict of interest leads to persons/contractors not best qualified for
the work
OR
− cost, e.g. if a conflict of interest leads to award of (sub)contract’s or purchases not
offering best value for money or lowest price.
179EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Conflicts of interests must be avoided irrespective of whether they actually affect quality or
cost, or whether the persons involved actually gain any benefit (or not).
Conflicts may be resulting from direct or indirect interests in relation to:
− family or emotional ties, while often connected, avoidance of conflict of interests
due to ‘family’ or ‘emotional life’ are separate obligations. An emotional bond between
family members is therefore not required for a person’s impartiality to be
compromised by reasons involving family, e.g. subcontracts with business owned by
family members, even if no close emotional ties exist
Examples:
Direct interest: A person works for a beneficiary who plans to subcontract a task. A company
owned by the person’s spouse may submit an offer. In this case the person working for the
beneficiary could have a direct interest in awarding the spouse’s company (and therefore would
need to declare a conflict of interest and abstain from being involved in the preparation and
award of the subcontract).
Indirect interest: A person works for a beneficiary who plans to subcontract a task. A
company may submit an offer. The person’s spouse my work for a usual supplier of that
company, or my own facilities or land that would be used by that company in case it
implements the subcontract. In this case the person working for the beneficiary could have an
indirect interest in awarding the company (and therefore would need to declare a conflict of
interest and abstain from being involved in the preparation and award of the subcontract).
− political or national affinity, this concerns situations where beneficiaries or third
parties may be chosen, or activities carried out, based on political or national
considerations (although a mere link with beliefs, views, opinions or preferences of the
person does not automatically constitute a personal interest)
Example: The CEO of a beneficiaries selects a contractor, or a site for a demonstration, not
based on objective and verifiable criteria on the merits, but instead selects a compatriot as
contractor or a demonstration site due to the political party membership of the local mayor.
− economic interests which include, but are not limited to, direct financial benefits
Examples:
1. A beneficiary or a person working for a beneficiary subcontracts work to another legal entity
because it is a shareholder in this other legal entity.
2. A professor working for a beneficiary (a university) subcontracts work to a consultancy firm
in which the professor is a partner.
3. A beneficiary agrees to award a subcontract to a company in exchange for preferential
treatment in that company’s own future contracting.
4. A person working for a beneficiary receives an offer for a subcontract from a company for
which the person has applied for a position.
− other direct and indirect interests, which can include reception of gifts or
hospitality, non-economic interests, or result from involvement with e.g. non-
governmental organisations (even if non-remunerated), resulting in competing duties
of loyalty between one entity the person owes a duty to and another person or entity
the person owes a duty.
Examples:
1. To discuss its proposed offer, a potential subcontractor has invited staff of the beneficiary to
its premises, including hotel accommodation, dinner and gifts.
2. A person involved in subcontracting of a beneficiary is also holding an office in a local NGO.
The President of the NGO owns a company that may become the subcontractor.
If there is a (risk of) a conflict of interests, the coordinator must inform the granting
authority so that steps can be agreed to resolve the situation and avoid cost rejection or
reduction of the grant.
180EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This may result in the requirement by the granting authority to put in place certain
measures, in particular for persons with a perceivable risk of conflict of interest to withdraw
from any decision-making that could affect their direct or indirect interest.

General > Article 13 — Confidentiality and security
ARTICLE 13 — CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
ARTICLE 13 — CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
13.1 Sensitive information
The parties must keep confidential any data, documents or other material (in any form) that is identified as
sensitive in writing (‘sensitive information’) — during the implementation of the action and for at least until
the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6).
If a beneficiary requests, the granting authority may agree to keep such information confidential for a longer
period.
Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, they may use sensitive information only to implement the
Agreement.
The beneficiaries may disclose sensitive information to their personnel or other participants involved in the
action only if they:
(a) need to know it in order to implement the Agreement and
(b) are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
The granting authority may disclose sensitive information to its staff and to other EU institutions and bodies.
It may moreover disclose sensitive information to third parties, if:
(a) this is necessary to implement the Agreement or safeguard the EU financial interests and
(b) the recipients of the information are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
The confidentiality obligations no longer apply if:
(a) the disclosing party agrees to release the other party
(b) the information becomes publicly available, without breaching any confidentiality obligation
(c) the disclosure of the sensitive information is required by EU, international or national law.
Specific confidentiality rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
13.2 Classified information
The parties must handle classified information in accordance with the applicable EU, international or national
law on classified information (in particular, Decision 2015/444 and its implementing rules).
Deliverables which contain classified information must be submitted according to special procedures agreed
with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted only after explicit approval (in writing)
from the granting authority.
Classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants involved in the action
implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the granting authority.
Specific security rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
13.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
182EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Sensitive information — Confidentiality
If the project involves, uses or generates information that should not be made public (e.g.
commercially sensitive information, business or trade secrets, confidential market data,
valuable results not yet protected by intellectual property rights, security-sensitive
information, etc), it should be identified and handled as ‘sensitive’ in accordance with the
provisions in Article 13.1 (and Annex 5, if the Grant Agreement sets out specific rules for the
programme, e.g. HE).
For actions raising specific concerns, such as security or public order (e.g. involving
strategic assets), beneficiaries may have to comply with additional obligations before and
after the grant award. For example, in some programmes (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF), actions
linked to security concerns may have to undergo a security review before selection and may
be made subject to specific security recommendations in Annex 1.
Sensitive information (former ‘confidential’; new for 2021-2027) must be kept confidential —
during the action and for at least five years afterwards (see Data Sheet, Point 6) — meaning
that they may be disclosed only within the strict limits of what is allowed under Article 13, in
particular to implement the Grant Agreement or protect the EU financial interests.
The confidentiality obligation is a minimum obligation: Beneficiaries may extend the period
and agree to additional confidentiality-related obligations among themselves (for example,
for access for other participants). Moreover, they may ask the granting authority to extend
the period. This request must explain why and clearly identify the sensitive information
concerned.
Best practice: In order to avoid issues, it is recommended that beneficiaries inform each
other and the granting authority in case they know about laws that would require disclosing
sensitive information. This can allow to work together to minimise any negative effects.
2. EU-classified information
If the project uses or generates information that is (or must be) classified, additional rules
and procedures will apply in line with Article 13.2 (and Annex 5, if the Grant Agreement sets
out specific rules for the programme).
These are in particular:
− security rules for protecting EU classified information set out in Decision No
2015/44431 and its implementing rules on classified grants32 and programme security
instruction (PSI), if any (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF,) and
− national rules on the protection of classified information.
31 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p.53).
32 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2021/259 of 10 February 2021 laying down implementing rules on
industrial security with regard to classified grants (OJ L 58, 19.2.2021, p. 55).
183EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In addition, security of information agreements concluded by the EU with third countries or
international organisations may also be indirectly relevant (for instance, may be a pre-
condition for awarding (or not) the grant by the granting authority), but they do not impose
any direct obligations for on the consortium (do not directly apply to them).
Projects expected to involve EU classified information (EUCI) will have to undergo a security
review procedure before selection, to set EU classification levels and other security
recommendations (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF).
Example: Some of the information produced by a project could potentially be used to plan
terrorist attacks or avoid detection of criminal activities.
For more guidance on classification of information and security obligations, see How to handle
security-sensitive projects, Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe
projects and Guidelines on the classification of information in Digital Europe projects.
3. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional rules may be set out in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF
CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM, EDF).

General > Article 14 — Ethics and values
ARTICLE 14 — ETHICS AND VALUES
ARTICLE 14 — ETHICS AND VALUES
14.1 Ethics
The action must be carried out in line with the highest ethical standards and the applicable EU, international
and national law on ethical principles.
Specific ethics rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
14.2 Values
The beneficiaries must commit to and ensure the respect of basic EU values (such as respect for human
dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities).
Specific rules on values (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
14.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Ethics
The action must ensure ethics compliance, this obligation is twofold:
− the action is in line with the highest ethical standards and
− the action ensures compliance with applicable international, EU and national law.
Main ethical principles:
▪ Respecting human dignity and integrity
▪ Ensuring honesty and transparency and notably getting free and informed consent
(as well as assent whenever relevant)
▪ Protecting vulnerable persons
▪ Ensuring privacy and confidentiality
▪ Promoting justice and inclusiveness
▪ Minimising harm and maximising benefit
▪ Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially in developing
countries
▪ Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction and
refinement in animal research
▪ Respecting and protecting the environment and present/future generations
The key sources of EU and international law are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols (for
other texts). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (UN CRPD).
Activities exposed to ethics risks usually run an ethics review as part of their grant selection
procedures (HE, DEP and EDF). Other programmes may perform manual checks.
185EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For more guidance, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment (can be used for all
programmes and especially for HE, DEP and EDF).
2. Values
All EU policies and programmes must respect the values on which the EU is founded and
which are set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Furthermore, the EU
institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the Member States, when implementing
EU law, must respect the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights
of the European Union.
Based on Article 14.2, during the implementation of the action, the beneficiaries must commit
to and ensure the respect of EU values.
EU values:
▪ respect for human dignity
▪ freedom
▪ democracy
▪ equality, including equality between women and men, non-discrimination
▪ rule of law
▪ respect for human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities
▪ pluralism, tolerance, justice, solidarity.
Accordingly, there can be no discrimination based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin,
genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a
national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation during the
implementation of the action or work programme.
3. Breaches of ethics or EU values
Breaches of ethics or EU values under this Article may lead to grant reductions (see Article
28) or other measures described in Chapter 5, such as rejection of costs or contributions,
payment deadline suspension, payment suspension, GA suspension, beneficiary or GA
termination, damages and administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures
and/or financial penalties).
Be aware that these measures may be taken not only when the beneficiary itself
breached the EU values, also when other persons and entities, such as its affiliated entities,
associated partners, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)
(see Articles 8, 9.1, 9.3 and 9.4) OR persons having powers of representation, decision-
making or control, or persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant breach
them (see Article 32).
Examples: Termination of a beneficiary because a person having powers of representation for the
beneficiary makes a public statement which discriminates against religion or belief.
4. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional rules may be set out in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF
EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, EDF, EU4H, Euratom, RELEX).

ARTICLE 15 — DATA PROTECTION
15.1 Data processing by the granting authority
Any personal data under the Agreement will be processed under the responsibility of the data controller of
the granting authority in accordance with and for the purposes set out in the Portal Privacy Statement.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission, an EU regulatory or executive agency,
joint undertaking or other EU body, the processing will be subject to Regulation 2018/172538.
38 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data,
and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).
1. Processing of personal data (by the EU)
The granting authority will process personal data in compliance with Regulation 2018/172533
and as set out in the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy Statement.
When the granting authority collects and processes personal data under the Grant
Agreement, national data protection law is NOT applicable and will NOT be accepted as a
justification for not complying with obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Personal data will be processed only for the purpose of implementing, managing and
monitoring the grant implementation/compliance with the provisions under the Grant
Agreement or protecting EU financial interests (including controls on eligibility of costs,
proper implementation of the action and compliance with other obligations).
The level of detail of the data requested will depend on the process and situation and will be
limited to what is necessary (data minimisation).
The processing of personal data under the Grant Agreement (manual or electronic) is notified
(by the data controller) to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) of the European Commission. In
addition, for processing that implies specific risks to the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects (e.g. processing of data relating to health), the European Data Protection Supervisor
(EDPS) will be consulted.
The notifications are available via the Register of the DPO1 (and describe the processing
operations, legal basis, security safeguards, retention period, possible data transfer, etc).
33 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and
agencies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).
187EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Right to access and correct personal data
Persons whose data is being processed (data subjects) can contact the data controller or the
DPO (via the contact information in the Privacy Statement), to:
− correct errors in the data, block access or delete their data
− complain about the data collection and use, and claim compensation for any damage.
3. Complaints to the EDPS
Persons whose data is being processed (data subjects) can also lodge a complaint with the
European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) (i.e. the independent supervisory authority for
data processing by EU institutions).
Best practice: Please contact first contact the data controller (see above) to clarify concerns
or solve problems regarding your data.

15.2 Data processing by the beneficiaries
15.2 Data processing by the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must process personal data under the Agreement in compliance with the applicable EU,
international and national law on data protection (in particular, Regulation 2016/67939).
They must ensure that personal data is:
- processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subjects
- collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is
incompatible with those purposes
- adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed
- accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
- kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
purposes for which the data is processed and
- processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the data.
The beneficiaries may grant their personnel access to personal data only if it is strictly necessary for
implementing, managing and monitoring the Agreement. The beneficiaries must ensure that the personnel is
under a confidentiality obligation.
The beneficiaries must inform the persons whose data are transferred to the granting authority and provide
them with the Portal Privacy Statement.
15.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
39 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (‘GDPR’) (OJ L 119,
4.5.2016, p. 1).
1. Processing of personal data (by the Consortium)
During the implementation of the action, the beneficiaries will collect and process personal
data, e.g. of their own staff, staff of other participants, and may also share such data with
the granting authority. In all such instances, the personal data must be processed in line with
the provisions under the Grant Agreement, in particular in compliance with applicable EU and
national law on data protection (in particular, with the General Data Protection Regulation
2016/67934 (GDPR)).
34 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and
repealing Directive 95/46/EC (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).
189EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The data protection obligations (e.g. to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully,
fairly and in a transparent manner) are a contractual obligation under the Grant Agreement
and apply to all beneficiaries, irrespective of whether the GDPR is directly applicable to them
or whether applicable national law provides for such requirements (or not).
According to those rules, personal data must be processed according to certain principles and
conditions (see EDPB data protection guide for small business).
‘Personal data’ means any information, private or professional, which relates to an identified
or identifiable natural person (for the full definition, see Article 4(1) GDPR).
− name, surname, phone numbers (e.g. staff)
− identification numbers, such as an individual’s client number, an individual’s employee
number
− a booking reference
− email addresses, location data
− photos, videos and audio recordings containing images or sounds of individuals.
Processing of special categories of data is in principle prohibited, except in the specific
circumstances set out in Article 9(2) GDPR.
Data that reveals information about health, sex life or sexual orientation, racial or ethnic
origin political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, biometric and genetic data or trade
union membership (so-called ‘sensitive data’) is subject to specific rules for the processing, in
order to protect it more.
‘Processing’ means any operation (or set of operations) which is performed on personal data,
either manually or by automatic means. This includes:
− − collection
− − recording
− − organisation
− - structuring
− - storage
− - adaptation or alteration
− − retrieval and consultation
− − use
− − disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available
− − alignment or combination
− − restriction, erasure or destruction.
190EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Examples (processing of personal data): creating a mailing list or a list of participants;
managing a database; accounting records on personnel costs; time-sheets; project planning with
names
Personal data must be processed according to certain principles and conditions that aim to
ensure both data quality and confidentiality35.
The beneficiaries must give their staff access to personal data on a need to know basis, for
carrying out their tasks/functions under the Grant Agreement. This means that the
beneficiaries must put in place adequate access controls and retention policies for the various
categories of data they hold.
The beneficiaries must inform persons (including their staff whose personal data are collected
and processed) about the disclosure of their data to the granting authority by providing them
with the Privacy Statement.
Examples:
1. Before encoding staff data in the Participant Register or into a proposal, the beneficiary must
provide the staff concerned with the privacy statement.
2. If in an ex-post audit, the Granting Authority requests the names, CVs, time-sheets and salaries
of the beneficiary’s staff (to check the eligibility of personnel costs), the beneficiary must inform
the staff concerned and provide them with the privacy statement.
The beneficiaries must ensure for all their data collection and processing a valid legal basis
(see EDPB data protection guide for small business > Process personal data lawfully). Special
attention is required were personal data is transferred to third countries (see EDPB data
protection guide for small business > International data transfers).
Specific cases (data protection):
International organisations (IOs) — The application of the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) is without prejudice to the provisions of international law, such as the
ones governing the privileges and immunities of international organisations (see Articles
10.2). The international organisations are subject to their own data protection internal rules /
regulatory frameworks. At the same time, any controller or processor that falls within the
scope of the GDPR for a given processing activity, and that exchanges personal data with
international organisations, has to comply with the GDPR rules on transfers to international
organisations. Agreements can build on elements already existing in the data protection
internal rules / regulatory framework of the international organisation.
Pillar-assessed participants — Entities that are pillar-assessed may rely on their own
positively assessed systems, rules and procedures for data protection (see Articles 10.3).
Easy to understand guidance on principles and compliance with data protection is for example
provided by the European Data Protection Board in the EDPB data protection guide for small
business.

RESULTS — ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE
ARTICLE 16 — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) — BACKGROUND AND
RESULTS —ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE
16.1 Background and access rights to background
The beneficiaries must give each other and the other participants access to the background identified as
needed for implementing the action, subject to any specific rules in Annex 5.
‘Background’ means any data, know-how or information — whatever its form or nature (tangible or
intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that is:
(a) held by the beneficiaries before they acceded to the Agreement and
(b) needed to implement the action or exploit the results.
If background is subject to rights of a third party, the beneficiary concerned must ensure that it is able to
comply with its obligations under the Agreement.
16.2 Ownership of results
The granting authority does not obtain ownership of the results produced under the action.
‘Results’ means any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as data, know-how or information,
whatever its form or nature, whether or not it can be protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including
intellectual property rights.
16.3 Rights of use of the granting authority on materials, documents and information received for
policy, information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes
The granting authority has the right to use non-sensitive information relating to the action and materials and
documents received from the beneficiaries (notably summaries for publication, deliverables, as well as any
other material, such as pictures or audio-visual material, in paper or electronic form) for policy information,
communication, dissemination and publicity purposes — during the action or afterwards.
The right to use the beneficiaries’ materials, documents and information is granted in the form of a royalty-
free, non-exclusive and irrevocable licence, which includes the following rights:
(a) use for its own purposes (in particular, making them available to persons working for the granting
authority or any other EU service (including institutions, bodies, offices, agencies, etc.) or EU
Member State institution or body; copying or reproducing them in whole or in part, in unlimited
numbers; and communication through press information services)
(b) distribution to the public (in particular, publication as hard copies and in electronic or digital
format, publication on the internet, as a downloadable or non-downloadable file, broadcasting by any
channel, public display or presentation, communicating through press information services, or
inclusion in widely accessible databases or indexes)
(c) editing or redrafting (including shortening, summarising, inserting other elements (e.g. meta-data,
legends, other graphic, visual, audio or text elements), extracting parts (e.g. audio or video files),
dividing into parts, use in a compilation)
(d) translation
(e) storage in paper, electronic or other form
(f) archiving, in line with applicable document-management rules
192EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(g) the right to authorise third parties to act on its behalf or sub-license to third parties the modes of use
set out in Points (b), (c), (d) and (f), if needed for the information, communication and publicity
activity of the granting authority and
(h) processing, analysing, aggregating the materials, documents and information received and
producing derivative works.
The rights of use are granted for the whole duration of the industrial or intellectual property rights concerned.
If materials or documents are subject to moral rights or third party rights (including intellectual property
rights or rights of natural persons on their image and voice), the beneficiaries must ensure that they comply
with their obligations under this Agreement (in particular, by obtaining the necessary licences and
authorisations from the rights holders concerned).
Where applicable, the granting authority will insert the following information:
“© – [year] – [name of the copyright owner]. All rights reserved. Licensed to the [name of granting authority] under conditions.”
16.4 Specific rules on IPR, results and background
Specific rules regarding intellectual property rights, results and background (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
16.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such a breach may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Background and access rights to background
In order to ensure a successful project, the participants must give each other mutual access
to background that is necessary for the project implementation (and thus get an overview of
the relevant background and identify if it is needed for the action).
Specific (or different) conditions and additional rules on access to background are
provided for some programmes in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF).
‘Background’ means any tangible or intangible input — from data to know-how, information
or rights — that exists before the grant is signed and that is needed to implement the action
or to exploit its results (e.g. database rights, patents, prototypes, cell lines, etc).
Background is not limited to input owned, but potentially extends to anything the
beneficiaries lawfully hold (e.g. through a licence with the right to sub-licence). If a
beneficiary is a legal person, it also extends to input held by other parts of the beneficiary’s
organisation.
For registered intellectual property rights (‘Intellectual property’ being understood in the
meaning defined in Article 2 of the Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property
Organisation36), it suffices that the application was filed before the grant is signed.
36 Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organisation, signed in Stockholm on 14 July 1967.
Available at http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/convention/trtdocs_wo029.html.
193EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If access to background is subject to restrictions due to the rights of third parties, the
beneficiary should inform the other beneficiaries — before signing the grant — to ensure that
the beneficiaries are still able to comply with their grant obligations.
Example: A beneficiary holding background is by a pre-existing agreement (e.g. licence
agreement) restricted in the access it can grant to such background. The beneficiaries may agree to
exclude the background. Such an exclusion may be temporary (e.g. to permit the adequate
protection of the background before providing access) or limited (e.g. to exclude only one or more
specific beneficiaries). But since background is by definition considered to be needed for the
implementation or exploitation, the impact of such an exclusion on the (especially if not temporary)
should be carefully examined by the beneficiaries.
Best practice: Although not obligatory, beneficiaries are advised to agree in writing on
background before the grant is signed, to ensure that they have access rights to what is
needed for implementing the action, including exploiting its results. The agreement may take
any form (e.g. positive list, negative list). It may be a separate agreement or may be part of
the consortium agreement. If after grant signature beneficiaries come to hold useful inputs
relevant to implement the action, they should endeavour to come to an agreement how such
inputs can be used in the action.
2. Ownership of results
Results belong to the beneficiary(ies) that generated them. The granting authority does not
obtain ownership of the results produced under the action.
‘Results’ include the action’s tangible effects (e.g. data, prototypes, microorganisms),
intangible effects (e.g. know-how, formulas), as well as any attached rights (e.g. patent
rights and database rights). Results do not include the effects generated/produced by
activities outside of the project — be it before the action starts, during its course or after it
ends.
Best practice: To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, beneficiaries should keep documents
such as laboratory notebooks to show how and when they produced the results.
3. Rights of use of the granting authority for communication, dissemination and
publicity purposes
The granting authority may use (free of charge) any non-sensitive information relating to the
action and materials and documents received from the beneficiaries for policy, information,
communication, dissemination and publicity purposes — during the action or afterwards.
Examples (materials): Summaries for publication (submitted as part of the reports), public
deliverables and any other material provided by beneficiaries, such as pictures or audio-visual
material.
Examples (communication activities): Using a picture or the publishable summary included in
the final report submitted by the action to write a story about successful actions for a Commission
publication, or for speeches, etc.
Examples (publicising activities): Providing on a granting authority website information about
the action such as its name, a project summary, the participating partners, the EU funding, etc.
The right to use the beneficiaries’ materials, documents and information is granted in the
form of a royalty-free, non-exclusive and irrevocable licence, for the whole duration of the
industrial or intellectual property rights concerned
Beneficiaries may ask the granting authority to include a copyright notice (e.g. by including
such a notice in the material).
The beneficiaries must ensure that granting authority the can use the documents or materials
by making arrangements with any third parties that could claim rights to them.
If the granting authority needs to edit or redraft the material, it will be careful not to distort
any content.

General > Article 17 — Communication and visibility
ARTICLE 17 — COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY
ARTICLE 17 — COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY
17.1 Communication — Dissemination — Promoting the action
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, the beneficiaries must promote the action and its results
by providing targeted information to multiple audiences (including the media and the public), in accordance
with Annex 1 and in a strategic, coherent and effective manner.
Before engaging in a communication or dissemination activity expected to have a major media impact, the
beneficiaries must inform the granting authority.
17.2 Visibility — European flag and funding statement
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, communication activities of the beneficiaries related to
the action (including media relations, conferences, seminars, information material, such as brochures,
leaflets, posters, presentations, etc., in electronic form, via traditional or social media, etc.), dissemination
activities and any infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, supplies or major result funded by the grant must
acknowledge the EU support and display the European flag (emblem) and funding statement (translated into
local languages, where appropriate):
The emblem must remain distinct and separate and cannot be modified by adding other visual marks, brands
or text.
Apart from the emblem, no other visual identity or logo may be used to highlight the EU support.
When displayed in association with other logos (e.g. of beneficiaries or sponsors), the emblem must be
displayed at least as prominently and visibly as the other logos.
For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the emblem without first
obtaining approval from the granting authority. This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.
Moreover, they may not appropriate the emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration or by
any other means.
196EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
17.3 Quality of information — Disclaimer
Any communication or dissemination activity related to the action must use factually accurate information.
Moreover, it must indicate the following disclaimer (translated into local languages where appropriate):
“Funded by the European Union. Views and opinions expressed are however those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily
reflect those of the European Union or [name of the granting authority]. Neither the European Union nor the granting authority can
be held responsible for them.”
17.4 Specific communication, dissemination and visibility rules
Specific communication, dissemination and visibility rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
17.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Communication, dissemination and promoting the action
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, the beneficiaries must promote the
action through communication and dissemination activities, by providing targeted information
to multiple audiences (including the media and the public), in a strategic and effective
manner and possibly engaging in a two-way exchange.
Security obligations — Respect of other obligations under the Grant Agreement may
limit in some cases the possibility to communicate about the action or disseminate (all of) its
results (e.g. security related obligations such as in case of grants involving classified
information; see Article 13).
The same may also be the case only temporarily, i.e. no communication until other
obligations under the Grant Agreement are fulfilled (e.g. until certain results are protected).
The beneficiaries are in principle free to choose the type of activities, but they should comply
with the principles below and in line with Annex 1.
Examples: A press release at the start of the action; an interview in the local radio station after
a major achievement of the action; organising workshops about the action; an event in a
shopping mall that shows how the outcomes of the action are relevant to our everyday lives;
producing a brochure to explain the action’s work to schools or university students.
The activities must be:
− effective (suited to achieving the action’s communication and dissemination goals) and
be proportionate to the scale of the action (activities carried out by a large-scale
action with beneficiaries coming from several different countries and a large budget
must be more ambitious than smaller actions)
− strategic (ad hoc efforts are NOT sufficient)
− coherent (avoid contradictory messages).
Moreover, the activities must address multiple audiences (beyond the action’s own
community), including the media and the public, in a way that can be understood by non-
specialists. They should highlight the action’s goals, results and include the public policy
perspective sought, e.g. by addressing aspects such as:
197EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− contribution to competitiveness and to solving societal challenges
− impact on everyday lives (e.g. creation of jobs, development of new technologies,
better quality products, more convenience, improved life-style, etc)
− actual or likely exploitation of the results by policy-makers, industry and other
communities
− transnational cooperation in a European consortium (i.e. how working together has
allowed to achieve more than otherwise possible).
The granting authority must be informed beforehand about any activity that is expected to
have a major media impact (media coverage in online and printed press, broadcast media,
social media, etc) that will go beyond having a local impact and which has the potential for
national and international outreach).
For more guidance and communication best practices, see Communicating about your EU-
funded project, EU communication network indicators, and the HE Social Media Guide.
For detailed instructions regarding the use of the European flag (emblem) and funding
statements (including downloadable pictures), see Guidelines on the use of the EU emblem in the
context of EU programmes 2021-2027.
2. Quality of information
Any communication or dissemination activity related to the action must use factually accurate
information. Should it later appear that certain information was not factually accurate (e.g.
new results obtained in a project disprove earlier information given about preliminary
results), the beneficiaries must take any appropriate and immediate steps to correct the
wrong information.
3. Specific rules in Annex 5

1. Specific rules for carrying out the action
For all EU programmes, specific rules for carrying out the action are set out in Annex 5.
These rules set out additional obligations that must be respected by the participants when
implementing the action activities. They are usually programme-specific and address
particular policy aspects and situations.
Like all other Annex 5 provisions, they are an integral part of the Grant Agreement and an
essential part of the obligations that must be complied with, in order to properly implement
the action.

19.1 Information requests
The beneficiaries must provide — during the action or afterwards and in accordance with Article 7 — any
information requested in order to verify eligibility of the costs or contributions declared, proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the other obligations under the Agreement.
The information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
1. Requests for information
In addition to the specific information obligations set out in other parts of the Grant
Agreement (e.g. Articles 20.1, 25.1.2, 25.1.3 and 26.1), the granting authority may request
information from the beneficiaries, to verify that they:
− properly implemented the tasks described in Annex 1
− complied with their obligations under the Grant Agreement.
The granting authority may request any type of information it needs (including personal data
in order to verify that costs declared for specific people are eligible; see Article 15). The level
of detail will depend on the purpose of the request.
It may request the information for any purpose (e.g. checks for monitoring the action or
assessing reports and requests for payment; reviews; audits; investigations; evaluation of
the action’s impact).
The granting authority may request this information at any time, either during the action or
afterwards.
Examples:
1. In an ex-post audit that starts 18 months after the balance is paid, the granting authority may
request any information it needs during the audit procedure (see Article 25).
2. The granting authority may request information from the beneficiaries in order to evaluate the
action’s impact within the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement (see Article
26).
The beneficiary concerned must provide accurate, precise and complete information, in the
format and within the deadline requested.
Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep records and other supporting documents
to prove the proper implementation of the action until the time-limit set out in the Data
Sheet (normally 5 years after final payment; see Article 20.1).
200EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Unless the Grant Agreement specifies direct communication with the other beneficiaries (e.g.
see Articles 7, 21, 25, 26, 39), the granting authority will (usually) contact the coordinator to
provide the information requested. All beneficiaries have to keep their contact information
updated in the Portal also after the end of the action, see Article 19.2.
Example: For audits after the end of the action, the granting authority will normally communicate
directly with the concerned beneficiary/affiliated entity.
All information exchanges should in principle take place through the the Portal, unless the
granting authority explicitly instructs or authorises otherwise (see Article 36).

General > Article 19.2 Participant Register update
19.2 Participant Register data updates
19.2 Participant Register data updates
The beneficiaries must keep — at all times, during the action or afterwards — their information stored in the
Portal Participant Register up to date, in particular, their name, address, legal representatives, legal form and
organisation type.
1. Information in the Participant Register
What? Each beneficiary must keep their information in the Participant Register up-to-date,
including after the end of the grant.
Updated information is required in particular during the time-limit for record-keeping set out
in the Data Sheet, e.g. for the purpose information requests for checks, reviews, audits and
investigation.
The information includes:
− name
− address
− legal representatives
− legal form (e.g. private limited liability company, public law body, S.A., S.L.)
− organisation type (e.g. SME, secondary or higher education establishment, etc.).
How? The information must be updated directly in the Portal Participant Register and will
then be available in the system.However, for important changes impacting the action
implementation, the coordinator should also be informed by the beneficiary (in writing).

General > Article 19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
The beneficiaries must immediately inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) of any of the
following:
(a) events which are likely to affect or delay the implementation of the action or affect the EU’s
financial interests, in particular:
(i) changes in their legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation (including
changes linked to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour signed
before grant signature)
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action information: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with linked actions: [OPTION 1 by default: linked action information: not
applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the grant: changes regarding the linked action (see
Article 3)]]
(b) circumstances affecting:
(i) the decision to award the grant or
(ii) compliance with requirements under the Agreement.
19.4 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
What? Each beneficiary must immediately inform about any event that is likely to
(significantly) affect or delay the action’s implementation or affect the EU financial interests.
Such change include in particular (but are not limited to) legal, financial, technical,
organisational or ownership changes and, if required in the Grant Agreement, changes in the
linked actions (if any).
Examples: A beneficiary is under financial stress and chooses to liquidate; a beneficiary is
acquired by or merged with another legal entity; a beneficiary plans to move its facility from a
Member State to a (non-EU) third country; the consortium implementing a linked action dissolves
and no longer cooperates, affecting the implementation of the action as described in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must also inform about any such changes concerning their affiliated entities.
How? The beneficiary concerned should normally inform the coordinator (through their usual
communication channels), who will then inform:
− the granting authority, via the Portal
− the other beneficiaries, through the usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail,
registered letters with proof of delivery, etc).
Best practice: It is recommended that these type of communications are done in writing (not
only orally).
203EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Register update — In many cases, the change may also require an update of the Participant
Register. Consult your LEAR and ask them to make the update.
2. Information about circumstances affecting the decision to award the grant or
compliance with requirements under the GA
What? Beneficiaries that become aware of circumstances (or changes thereof) that could
(potentially) affect the decision to award the grant or compliance with requirements under
the Grant Agreement must disclose them.
Relevant circumstances are those that:
− affect (or could have affected) the decision to award the grant, e.g. if the
information had been known at the time of evaluation it may have led to a different
scoring in the award criteria and may thus have affected the ranking of proposals,
and/or it would have led to rejection (e.g. due to ineligibility)
Example (eligibility): The eligibility criteria of a call require a consortium of three
beneficiaries established in Member States. During the action implementation, one of the
beneficiaries decides to relocate to a third country.
Example (award criteria): A consortium has three beneficiaries. One of them has a
laboratory with specialised equipment and personnel, including a team of internationally
renowned experts in the same field as the project. The quality of the work to be carried out by
this laboratory was taken into account by the evaluators for the scoring of the award criteria,
leading to a higher ranking of the proposal. During the action’s implementation, the beneficiary
sells the laboratory to an external company without involvement in the action, losing an
important part of the relevant expertise.
− affect (or could affect) the fulfilment of obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples (obligations):
1. Due to e.g. a merger, acquisition or contractual changes, certain intellectual property (e.g.
background identified as needed for implementing the action) becomes subject to rights of a
third party which no longer allows the beneficiary to implement the action as described in Annex
1, so the beneficiary can no longer comply with its obligations under the grant.
2. Due to a change of national legislation (e.g. security or export restrictions), the beneficiary
sees itself no longer able to provide deliverables and report on its activities in accordance with
the Grant Agreement.
Even if certain circumstances do not amount to a situation that would potentially affect the
decision to award the grant or compliance with requirements under the Grant Agreement, they may
still have to be notified under point (a) as events which are likely to affect or delay the
implementation of the action or affect the EU financial interests
How? The beneficiary concerned should normally inform the coordinator who will then inform
the granting authority and the other consortium members.
Based on the information, it is then up to the granting authority to assess whether the award
decision or the fulfilment of the obligations are actually affected and whether further
measures are required (incl. measures set out in Chapter 5).
Best practice: In case of doubt, the beneficiary should inform the granting authority (or
coordinator) for clarification.

General > Article 20 — Record-keeping
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
20.1 Keeping records and supporting documents
The beneficiaries must — at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6) — keep records
and other supporting documents to prove the proper implementation of the action in line with the accepted
standards in the respective field (if any).
In addition, the beneficiaries must — for the same period — keep the following to justify the amounts
declared:
(a) for actual costs: adequate records and supporting documents to prove the costs declared (such as
contracts, subcontracts, invoices and accounting records); in addition, the beneficiaries’ usual
accounting and internal control procedures must enable direct reconciliation between the amounts
declared, the amounts recorded in their accounts and the amounts stated in the supporting documents
(b) for flat-rate costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to prove the
eligibility of the costs or contributions to which the flat-rate is applied
(c) for the following simplified costs and contributions: the beneficiaries do not need to keep specific
records on the actual costs incurred, but must keep:
(i) for unit costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to
prove the number of units declared
(ii) for lump sum costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents
to prove proper implementation of the work as described in Annex 1
(iii) for financing not linked to costs (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to
prove the achievement of the results or the fulfilment of the conditions as described in
Annex 1
(d) for unit, flat-rate and lump sum costs and contributions according to usual cost accounting practices
(if any): the beneficiaries must keep any adequate records and supporting documents to prove that
their cost accounting practices have been applied in a consistent manner, based on objective criteria,
regardless of the source of funding, and that they comply with the eligibility conditions set out in
Articles 6.1 and 6.2.
Moreover, the following is needed for specific budget categories:
(e) for personnel costs: time worked for the beneficiary under the action must be supported by
declarations signed monthly by the person and their supervisor, unless another reliable time-record
system is in place; the granting authority may accept alternative evidence supporting the time
worked for the action declared, if it considers that it offers an adequate level of assurance
(f) [OPTION 1 by default: additional record-keeping rules: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes
with additional record-keeping rules: [OPTION 1 by default: additional record-keeping rules: not
applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the call: for [insert name of budget category]: [insert specific
records/requirements]].]
The records and supporting documents must be made available upon request (see Article 19) or in the context
of checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the
Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 25), the beneficiaries must keep these records
and other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.
205EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are considered
originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The granting authority may accept non-
original documents if they offer a comparable level of assurance.
20.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions insufficiently
substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 27), and the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Records and other supporting documentation
The beneficiaries (and their affiliated entities) must keep appropriate and sufficient evidence
to prove the eligibility of all the costs declared, proper implementation of the action and
compliance with all the other obligations under the Grant Agreement. If costs are not
supported by appropriate and sufficient evidence, they will be rejected.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries that do not keep sufficient and appropriate supporting
documents will bear the full risk. The granting authority may take any measures set out in
Chapter 5, including to reject cost or reduce or terminate the grant. Systemic failure to keep
supporting documents may also lead to consequences in other EU actions (extension of audit
findings).
‘Sufficiency’ relates to the quantity of evidence; ‘appropriateness’ relates to its quality.
Evidence is considered sufficient and appropriate if it is persuasive enough to support the
facts or elements that need to be established. In the case of audits, the evidence will be
assessed by the auditors according to generally accepted audit standards.37
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.
Best practice: Where the nature of the action or participants may pose risks or difficulties for
checks, reviews, audits and investigations, the consortium may consider on procedures to
facilitate access to records, e.g. by depositing also adequate records with the coordinator, in
order to minimise the risk for cost rejections by the granting authority due to lack of access
to supporting documents.
The evidence must be correctly archived for the duration indicated in the Grant Agreement
(see Data Sheet, Point 6). In general, for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (3 years
for low-value grants up to EUR 60 000) or longer if there are ongoing procedures (audits,
investigations, litigation, etc). In this case, the evidence must be kept until ongoing
procedures end.
The rules in the Grant Agreement determine obligations under the EU action and do NOT
absolve the beneficiary from compliance with obligations under national law, e.g. national laws
requiring a longer retention period for keeping documents (or other additional measures).
37 International Standard on Auditing ISA 500 ‘Audit Evidence’.
206EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Original documents
In principle, the beneficiaries must keep original documents (i.e. documents considered as
original under national law) in the format in which they were received or created. This means
that:
− documents received or created in paper form should be kept in paper form
− documents received or created electronically should be kept in their electronic format
(hard copies of original electronic documents are NOT required).
Examples:
1. We will accept authenticated copies or digitally-signed documents, if national law accepts these
as originals.
2. We will accept digitalised copies of documents (instead of hard copies), if this is acceptable under
national law.
Exceptionally, the granting authority may accept non-original documents if they offer a
comparable level of assurance but this assessment is entirely up to the granting authority
and any beneficiary not keeping an original bears the full risk of cost rejection or grant
reduction.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should apply a consistent record-keeping policy, i.e. avoid that
non-original documents are presented only for the EU action whereas original records are
kept for other activities.
3. Records for actual costs
For actual costs, the beneficiaries must:
− keep detailed records and other supporting documents to prove the eligibility of the
costs declared
− use cost accounting practices and internal control procedures that make it possible to
verify that the amounts declared, amounts recorded in the accounts and amounts
recorded in supporting documentation match up.
The information included in the financial statements for each budget category (i.e. personnel
costs, subcontracting costs, etc) must be broken down into details and must match the
amounts recorded in the accounts and in supporting documentation.
Examples:
1. For costs declared in category A.1 Employees (or equivalent): the costs must be detailed for
each person carrying out work for the action (individual daily rate multiplied by day-equivalents
worked for the action). They must match the accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions,
annual financial statements) and supporting documentation (i.e. labour contracts, collective labour
agreements, applicable national law on taxes, labour and social security contributions, payslips,
time records, bank statements showing salary payments, etc).
2. For costs declared in category C. Purchase costs: the beneficiary must keep a breakdown of
costs declared by type (i.e. equipment cost, costs of other goods, works and services, etc). It
should be able to provide details of individual transactions for each type of cost. For depreciation, it
must be able to provide details per individual equipment used for the action. Declared costs must
match accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions, annual financial statements) and
supporting documentation (i.e. purchase orders, delivery notes, invoices, contracts, bank
statements, asset usage logbook, depreciation policy, etc).
4. Records for simplified cost and contributions, and financing not linked to cost
In contrast to actual cost, for simplified cost options (units, lump sums, flat-rates) and
financing not linked to cost, keeping of financial records on the actual cost incurred during
the action is NOT required.
207EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This does NOT however release the beneficiary from record-keeping rules under
applicable national law. The simplification relates to the EU grant-specific record-keeping
and reporting obligations.
Any financial and accounting records will not be assessed unless it is necessary for the
assessment of the implementation of the units, lump sums etc. declared, or to assess the
correctness of the methodology for beneficiaries using their usual cost accounting practices
(see below), or to assess the correctness of information provided in the proposal on which
basis a simplified cost amount was established.
− flat-rate costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and
other supporting documents to prove that the costs to which the flat-rate is applied
are eligible.
Example: For the flat-rate of indirect costs, the auditors will verify (and the beneficiaries must
be able to show) that the actual direct costs to which the flat-rate is applied are eligible.
− unit costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and other
supporting documents to prove the number of units declared.
− lump sum costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the completion of the action tasks, the achievement of
results, or the fulfilment of the conditions as described in Annex 1.
− financing not linked to costs: the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the achievement of the results or the fulfilment of the
conditions as described in Annex 1.
5. Records for unit, flat-rate, lump sum costs and contributions calculated in
accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices
For unit, flat-rate, lump sum costs and contributions declared in accordance with usual cost
accounting practices, the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and other supporting
documents to:
− show that the method used is their usual cost accounting practice (i.e. not just used
for the EU grant)
− show that the method used for the initial calculation of the unit, flat-rate, or lump sum
appropriately reflects the actual costs as recorded in the statutory accounts
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): accounting records;
financial statement extracts; labour contracts; collective labour agreements; applicable tax,
labour and social security laws; pay slips; bank statements showing salary payments;
classification of employees (based on experience, qualifications, salary, department, etc).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): accounting records; financial
statement extracts; time records (or other records) for the share of personnel costs included in
the unit costs; invoices or contracts for maintenance costs, cleaning costs, other services, etc,
showing how the actual costs are directly or indirectly included in the unit cost calculation.
Manual interventions into the accounting data (if any) must be traceable and
documented.
− verify that the unit, flat-rate, lump sum are free of ineligible cost components
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): records that show that the
daily rate does not include an indirect cost component (they should be covered by the indirect
208EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
costs category); records that show that the daily rate does not include travel costs (they should
be claimed under category C.1 Travel and subsistence).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): evidence that shows that there is
no profit/margin/mark-up included in the internally invoiced goods and services (e.g. different
rates: one for billing the activity, with mark-up, and another one for internal costing, free of any
mark-up); lists of accounts/cost centres that were excluded from the calculation of internally
invoiced goods and services — because already included in the costs claimed under another
budget categories (e.g. under personnel costs)
− assess the acceptability of budgeted and estimated elements.
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): records that show the
method for calculating the annual salary increases (e.g. consumer price index which, according
to the beneficiary’s usual remuneration policy, serves as the basis for annual salary increases).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): traceable data used to determine
the budgeted/ estimated elements; records on the nature and frequency of the updates of the
budgeted and estimated elements; etc.
It is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred during the action (per
person/good or service) — unless they are needed to document the usual cost accounting
practices.
6. Records for personnel costs — Day-equivalents worked for the action
For persons who work for the action (regardless if they are full-time or part-time employees
and/or if they work exclusively or not for the action; new for 2021-2027), the beneficiaries
may either:
− by default, sign a monthly declaration on day-equivalents worked for the action
(template)
OR
− use another paper- or computer-based reliable time recording system, to record (at
least) all the time (days/hours) worked for the action.
Best practice: It is recommended to explore the simplification potential of using monthly
declarations on days worked for the action. This limits record-keeping burden and avoids the
need for conversion of hours into day-equivalents.
Reliable time records must be dated and signed at least monthly by the person working for
the action and their supervisor.
NO rounding (up or down to the nearest half day-equivalent) for the time recording in
the monthly declarations. The rounding rule applies ONLY for the cost calculation (i.e. the
number of day-equivalents to declare and the maximum declarable day-equivalents) and for
the conversion from the total hours worked on the action into day-equivalents (in case of
time-recording systems based on hours). By contrast, it is NOT allowed to round up or down
to the nearest half day-equivalent in the monthly declaration.
Example: If a person with a standard working day of 8 hours worked 2 hours on the action during a
given month, 0,25 day-equivalents should be recorded for that month in their monthly declaration.
If the time recording system is computer-based, the signatures may be electronic (i.e. linking
the electronic identity data, e.g. a password and user name, to the electronic validation
data), with a documented and secure process for managing user rights and an auditable log
of all electronic transactions.
209EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Conversion of hours into day-equivalents: If you do not use the monthly declaration of
days, and instead record the time worked in hours, you must convert the total hours worked
into day-equivalents to calculate the personnel costs for the grant (see Article 6.2.A.1).
To convert hours into day-equivalents:
{number of hours worked by the person on the action during the reporting period
divided by
(number of hours of a day-equivalent)}
The resulting figure must be rounded up or down to the nearest half-day (e.g. 17,79 = 18
day-equivalents; 17,64 = 17,5 day-equivalents).
You have three options to determine the number of hours of a day-equivalent:
− Option 1: a day-equivalent is 8 hours
− Option 2: average working hours as per contract (or another binding document, e.g.
collective labour agreement, national labour legislation). You can NOT use this option
if the contract (or other binding document) does not allow to determine the average
number of hours that the person must work per day. By contrast, fluctuating or
variable working hours during the year are not a problem (see specific cases below).
− 2a: If the number of working hours is specified per day:
{working hours per day divided by working time factor}
Examples:
Full-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person is employed
full-time and must work 7,8 hours each working day. A day-equivalent for the
person is 7,8 hours (7,8 / 1 [working time factor]).
Part-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person is employed
50 % part-time and must work 4 hours each working day. A day-equivalent for the
person is 8 hours (4 / 0.5 [working time factor]).
− 2b: If the number of working hours is specified per week or month:
{(working hours per week [or month] divided by working time factor) divided by
working days per week [or month]}
For the calculation above, the number of ‘working days’ per week (or
month) is not the actual days worked by the person, but the standard number
of working days per week (or month) as per the beneficiary’s usual practices
(and applicable rules/laws). This is usually 5 working days per week (e.g.
Monday to Friday). The number should be the same for full-time and part-time
employees irrespective of the actual distribution of the (full or part-time)
working time over the week (or month).
Examples:
Full-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person must work
37,5 hours per week over 5 working days. A day-equivalent for the person is ((37,5
/ 1 [working time factor]) / 5 [days]) = 7,5 hours.
Part-time case (hours per week): The person is employed 50 % part-time and
the contract establishes that the person must work 18,75 hours per week
(consisting of five working days as per the beneficiary’s practice). In practice, the
person works two full days and a half each week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
morning). The number of working days to be used in the formula is 5 (NOT 2,5 or 3
actual days worked). A day-equivalent for the person is ((18.75 / 0.5 [working time
factor]) / 5 [days]) = 7,5 hours.
210EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Part-time case (hours per month): The person is employed 50 % part-time and
the contract establishes that the person must work 80 hours per month over 22
working days. A day-equivalent for the person is ((80 / 0,5 [working time factor]) /
22 [days]) = 7,3 hours.
− 2c: If the number of working hours is specified per year:
{(working hours per year divided by working time factor) divided by 215}
Example: If the collective labour agreement sets out 1612 hours of work per year
for full-time employees, the hours for the calculation must be adapted to 806 (1612
x 0,5) working hours per year for a 50% part-time employee, i.e. 806 / 0,5 / 215 =
7.5h day-equivalent.
− Option 3: If you have a usual cost accounting practice determining the standard
number of annual productive hours of a full-time employee, you may determine the
value of a day-equivalent as follows:
{(the higher between the standard number of annual productive hours of a full-time
employee and 90 % of the standard annual workable hours of a full-time employee)
divided by
215}
The chosen option must be applied consistently, i.e. using the same option at least
per group of personnel employed under similar conditions (e.g. same type of contract,
same cost-centre). You cannot apply the most favourable option for each employee
individually.
A conversion normally needs to be done only once per person per reporting period
for the purpose of reporting to the granting authority. It is not required that you keep a
parallel record system that directly converts hours into day-equivalents.
If you keep parallel time record systems, e.g. weekly time-sheets of hours and
monthly declarations of days, they must be consistent. In case of significant
discrepancies discovered e.g. during checks, reviews and audits, only the set of documents
recording the lower amount of days will be accepted.
Specific cases (conversion into day-equivalents):
Change of working hours during a reporting period — Option 2 (average working hours
as per contract) can also be used in case of work pattern changes (for instance, in case of an
amendment to the internal regulations and/or national (labour) law of the beneficiary
concerning daily working hours within the reporting period). In this case, the conversion from
hours to day equivalents must be done separately; in practice, you should perform a
separate conversion calculation for each period during which a different work pattern regime
was in effect. Then, sum the results to determine the total number of hours converted into
day-equivalents
Example: The beneficiary has decided to modify the working hours schedule effective from
01/01/2025, reducing the work day from 8 hours to 7 hours. The reporting period for the action is
from 01/01/2024 to 30/06/2025. The daily rate for each individual employee should be calculated
based on the hours worked (converted into day equivalents) during 2024 and 2025. The conversion
from hours to day equivalents should be calculated as follows:
A full-time employee of the beneficiary has recorded 800 hours in the year 2024 and 280 hours in
2025 for work on this project. To calculate the day equivalents worked for the action:
(800 hours worked in 2024 divided by the 8-hour day equivalent in 2024) plus (280 hours worked
in 2025 divided by the 7-hour day equivalent in 2025) equals 100 + 40, which totals 140 day
equivalents worked for the action.
Changes of working hours during different periods of each year (annual seasonal
fluctuation in working hours) — When the number of working hours fluctuates over the
211EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
year (e.g. 8 hours per day for all months except 7 hours per day during July and August), the
following formula must be applied:
{[(working hours per day multiplied by the number of months to which it applies) plus (working
hours per day multiplied by the number of months to which it applies)] divided by 12. The result
should then be divided by working time factor}
7. Records of affiliated entities, associated partners and other participants
In principle, each participant keeps their own records (to prove costs or proper
implementation; new for 2021-2027). In case of a check, review, audit or investigation, the
granting authority may ask the coordinator or responsible beneficiary to provide the
necessary documents.

ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
21.1 Continuous reporting
The beneficiaries must report on the progress of the action (e.g. deliverables, milestones,
outputs/outcomes, critical risks, indicators, etc; if any), in the Portal Continuous Reporting tool and in
accordance with the timing and conditions it sets out (as agreed with the granting authority).
Standardised deliverables (e.g. progress reports not linked to payments, reports on cumulative expenditure,
special reports, etc; if any) must be submitted using the templates published on the Portal.
1. Continuous reporting
What? The beneficiaries must provide regular updates on the status of the action
implementation. This is the continuous reporting.
The continuous reporting may cover (non-exhaustive list):
− progress in achieving milestones, which are control points in the action that help to
chart progress (kick-off meetings, steering committees, first-draft of a survey,
prototype, etc); they may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, which
allows the next phase of the work to begin or is needed at intermediary points
− deliverables, which are additional outputs that must be produced at a given moment
during the action and submitted to the granting authority
Examples: Information, special report, a technical diagram brochure, list, a software milestone
or other building block of the action.
− response to critical risks, which are a plausible event or issue that could have a high
adverse impact on the ability of the action to achieve its objectives
− programme-specific monitoring information or indicators like those related to
publications, communications activities, IPRs, Open Data, Trainings, Gender etc. (if
required for your programme and depending on the type of action).
How & When? The deliverables (including progress reports not linked to payments, if any)
must be submitted through the Portal Continuous Reporting tool, in accordance with the
schedule set out for them. Both the schedule and templates to be used (if any) are available
through the Deliverables screen.

General > Article 21.2 Periodic reporting
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
In addition, the beneficiaries must provide reports to request payments, in accordance with the schedule and
modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2):
- for additional pre-financings (if any): an additional pre-financing report
- for interim payments (if any) and the final payment: a periodic report.
The pre-financing and periodic reports include a technical and financial part.
The technical part includes an overview of the action implementation. It must be prepared using the template
available in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool.
The financial part of the additional pre-financing report includes a statement on the use of the previous pre-
financing payment.
The financial part of the periodic report includes:
− the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all beneficiaries/affiliated entities)
− the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
− the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point
4.3).
The financial statements must detail the eligible costs and contributions for each budget category and, for
the final payment, also the revenues for the action (see Articles 6 and 22).
All eligible costs and contributions incurred should be declared, even if they exceed the amounts indicated in
the estimated budget (see Annex 2). Amounts that are not declared in the individual financial statements will
not be taken into account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statements (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the beneficiaries confirm
that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the costs and contributions declared are eligible (see Article 6)
- the costs and contributions can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting documents (see
Article 20) that will be produced upon request (see Article 19) or in the context of checks, reviews,
audits and investigations (see Article 25)
- for the final periodic report: all the revenues have been declared (if required; see Article 22).
Beneficiaries will have to submit also the financial statements of their affiliated entities (if any). In case of
recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the financial statements of their
affiliated entities.
1. Periodic reporting
What? In addition to the continuous reporting and in order to receive payments (any type;
additional pre-financings, interim and final payment), the beneficiaries (and their affiliated
entities) must submit reports for payment to document the technical (and financial)
implementation of the action. This is the periodic reporting.
214EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
These reports must be distinguished from deliverables and milestones (that are part of
Annex 1; see Article 21.1).
How & When? The reports for payment must be submitted through the Portal Periodic
Reporting tool after the end of each reporting period (including the final one; for the
schedule, see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
The coordinator must submit either an additional pre-financing report (for additional pre-
financing payment) or a periodic report (for interim and final payment).
In both cases, this report is composed of two main parts, a technical and a financial part.
The technical part aims at providing an overview of the action implementation and progress
and its content is programme-specific. It usually includes an explanation of work carried out,
overview of progress, publishable summary, key performance indicators, etc (template
available for download directly in the system)
The financial part is filled in directly online and includes:
− for additional pre-financing:
− a statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment (only supporting
document; no other financial information to be filled in)
− for interim and final payments:
− the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all
beneficiaries/affiliated entities
− the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if
required)
− the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2
and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) (template available for download directly in the
system).
The explanation of the use of resources must be consistent with the costs declared
in the financial statement (for each beneficiary/affiliated entity).
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries must keep adequate records of the documents
submitted for their affiliated entities (e.g. financial statement, CFS, etc; see Article 20).
For additional pre-financings, the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing
serves to curb the paying out of additional pre-financing, if not really needed (— either
because progress of the action is slow or the consumption of the previous pre-financing is
low). The additional pre-financing payment will be reduced, if — according to this statement
— the previous pre-financing was not fully used (see Article 22.3.1). Thus:
− if 70% or more of the previous pre-financing has been used: the additional pre-
financing is paid in full
− if less than 70% of the previous pre-financing has been used: the additional pre-
financing will be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the
percentage actually used and 70%.
For interim or final payments, each beneficiary/affiliated entity must fill out their individual
financial statement (individually), and then signed and formally submitted to the coordinator
(for beneficiaries, directly in the Portal; for affiliated entities, through their beneficiary). This
includes the coordinator, who must also submit the individual financial statement for itself.
215EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The individual financial statements (Annex 4 of the Grant Agreement) must contain all costs
that:
− were incurred by the beneficiary/affiliated entities during the reporting period and
− fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.
Best practice: Beneficiaries/affiliated entities should declare ALL their eligible costs — even if
they are above the estimated budget in Annex 2 (cost overruns). The grant will be capped at
the maximum grant amount in Annex 2, but cost overruns may turn out useful, if the
granting authority should reject some of the costs (at payment or later on).
Beneficiaries/affiliated entities may declare costs incurred during a previous reporting period,
if they were not declared before.
By contrast, once costs have been declared (closed financial statement), they should
normally no longer be changed. If a beneficiary/affiliated entity notices a mistake in a
previous financial statement (e.g. incorrect accounting information; error in the calculation;
etc), they can however make an adjustment (positive or negative) at the next reporting.
Such adjustments can be made to the financial statements for any previous reporting period.
Example: An internal audit by the beneficiary on the annual accounts finds errors in the
accounting information used to calculate the daily rate. The beneficiary can adapt the costs
declared to the EU action at the next reporting.
For affiliated entities, the financial statements must be filled out and submitted by their
beneficiary (since the affiliated entities cannot sign them in the IT system). Before
submission, the beneficiary must complete the data for the affiliated entity (based on the
information it received from the affiliated entity). The affiliated entity must ensure the
accuracy of the encoded information, but the beneficiary is ultimately responsible for
submitting the statement (see Article 21.2).
Best practice: Beneficiaries and their affiliated entities may establish practical information
exchange procedures to ensure and verify the accuracy of the financial statement data to be
submitted. For example, the beneficiary can create a PDF export from the system and send
it to the affiliated entity for confirmation.

Beneficiaries with general accounts in euro must convert costs incurred in another currency into euro
according to their usual accounting practices.]
1. Currency for financial statements and conversion into euro
Beneficiaries/affiliated entities must report their costs in the financial statements in euros.
The rules on conversion (of costs incurred in other currencies into euros) are as follows:
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities with accounting records in euros: conversion of
costs according to their usual accounting practices
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities with accounting records in a currency other than the
euro, the rules on conversion of costs recorded in their accounts may be one of the
following:
217EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for programmes with double conversion rule (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2; currently
all programmes):
− using the average, over the corresponding reporting period, of the daily
exchange rates published (most programmes):
− in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union
To calculate this average rate based on the daily exchange rates
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union,
the beneficiaries may use the editable charts on the ECB website.
How to calculate the rate on the ECB website:
Step 1 — Go to the ECB website.
Step 2 — Click on the chart icon [ ] for the currency.
Step 3 — Select the conversion (normally other currency vs. Euro).
Step 4 — Insert the starting date of the reporting period in the field
‘from’ and the end date of the reporting period in the field ‘to’. The
average for the period will appear above the chart.
Note that the ECB has changed their methodology for the displayed
average currency exchange rates (over any given period). Therefore,
average currency conversion rates taken from the ECB website before 13
April 2023 may not correspond to the average for the same period
displayed since April 13. Financial statements based on currency
conversions done with the ECB calculator before 13 April 2023 remain
however fully valid and will be recognised in case of checks, audits,
reviews or investigations. You do not need to make any

corresponding reporting period, using the currency converter on the
Commission website (InforEur).
− using either an average, monthly or daily rate (RELEX):
− for the average rate: calculation using the average over the reporting
period, in accordance with the same rules as above (plus possibility to
use the exchange rate published by Oanda instead of the rate published
by the EU)
− for the monthly rate: calculation for each month separately over the
reporting period, using the monthly accounting exchange rate published,
for each month, on the European Commission website (InforEuro)
− for the daily rate: calculation for each day separately over the reporting
period, using the accounting exchange rate published, for each day
either by the EU on the ECB website or by Oanda.
For cost adjustments to previous periods (‘adjustment financial statements’), the exchange
rate to be used is the one for the reporting period in which the costs adjusted were incurred.
For partial reporting periods (e.g. because a beneficiary joins the grant in the middle of a
reporting period), the exchange rate should be calculated as from the start date of joining the
grant.For eligible costs related to drafting and submitting the final reports incurred after the
action duration, the exchange rate to be used is the one for the last reporting period.

The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority
(see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
21.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a report submitted does not comply with this Article, the granting authority may suspend the payment
deadline (see Article 29) and apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the grant or the
coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Language of reports
For most programmes, the reports must be drafted in the language of the Grant
Agreement (indicated at the end of the Grant Agreement, next to the signatures of the
parties), unless the granting authority agreed differently.
For RELEX, the Data Sheet option in the Grant Agreement refers to the language(s) specified
in the call document (and this special language regime is then valid also for project reviews
and audits; see Article 25).

ARTICLE 22 — PAYMENTS AND RECOVERIES — CALCULATION OF AMOUNTS DUE
22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) and must be
distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to distribution of the initial pre-financing payment;
see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date when they are debited
to its account.
1. Payments to be made
The granting authority will make payments in accordance with what is set out in the Data
Sheet. This may include the following:
− pre-financing payment(s) at the beginning of the action (to provide beneficiaries
with a cash float to start working on the project).
Pre-financing will NOT be paid before the Grant Agreement is signed (even if the
starting date of the action is before).
− interim payment(s) to cover eligible costs incurred in the reporting periods (as
many interim payments as number of reporting periods, minus one which is the final
payment)
− the final payment (payment of the balance) after the end of the action.
All payments are subject to a payment deadline (i.e. number of days within which the
granting authority has to pay the consortium — after having received the payment request).
The deadline is defined in the Data Sheet.
If there are issues with the payment request or with the costs declared which make it
impossible to continue with the payment, the granting authority will suspend the deadline
(see Article 29). The granting authority can also, in specific circumstances, suspend
payments (see Article 30).
220EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
All payments (pre-financings, interim payments and final payment) may be offset against
debts of any of the beneficiaries towards the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary based on its eligible cost and contributions. If the granting authority is the
Commission or an EU executive agency, the offsetting will also be done for debts towards other
Commission services or executive agencies. This offsetting will be done automatically and is not
subject to the consent of the beneficiary concerned.
Note that in case of early termination of the action, the coordinator should normally not
become responsible for paying back amounts of prefinancing that were never received because
they were offset for the debts of another partner. If this happens, the granting authority may
agree to deviate from the Grant Agreement provisions and re-instate the recovery order towards
the initial debtor. Please contact the EU project officer in charge of your grant.
The payments are made to the coordinator’s bank account as set out in the Grant
Agreement; the beneficiaries are NOT paid individually by the granting authority.
The coordinator must distribute the amounts received to the beneficiaries. However, how and
when the payments are distributed is in principle an internal matter for the consortium.
The consortium agreement (if applicable) may set out, for instance, specific periods
for the distribution of payments or that the distribution will be carried out in
instalments (and these will not be considered ‘unjustified delays’, if the arrangements
set out in the consortium agreement are complied with).
Similarly, the consortium agreement may provide for a distribution of the funding
which is different from the contribution approved by the granting authority for each
beneficiary.
If the coordinator does NOT comply with its payment distribution obligations, this is in
principle an issue to be resolved within the consortium. However, persistent failure to
comply with obligations of the coordinator (such as distribution of payments) may lead
to any of the consequences as provided under the respective measure in Chapter 5.
The granting authority will normally not be informed of the distribution of the payments by
the coordinator, unless:
− if it specifically requests this
− in the event of recovery at the payment of the balance (see Article 22.3.4)
− if the participation of one or more beneficiary is terminated (see Article 22.3.2).

22.2 Recoveries
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it turns out that the
granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts undue.
[OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: The general liability regime for
recoveries (first-line liability) is as follows: At final payment, the coordinator will be fully liable for
recoveries, even if it has not been the final recipient of the undue amounts. At beneficiary termination or after
final payment, recoveries will be made directly against the beneficiaries concerned.
Beneficiaries will be fully liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4):
- the beneficiaries will be jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of another beneficiary under
the Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority (see Data
Sheet, Point 4.4)
- affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of their beneficiaries under the Agreement
(including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
[OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: Each beneficiary’s financial
responsibility in case of recovery is in principle limited to their own debt and undue amounts of their
affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4), affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of
their beneficiaries, if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
1. Recoveries of undue amounts
If it turns out that the granting authority has paid too much — for example due to cost
rejection or grant reduction (in particular, following a check, audit, extension of audit
findings, review or OLAF investigation), it will recover the amount paid in excess.
Recovery normally takes place only at payment of the balance or afterwards. Exceptionally, it
can take place before, if a beneficiary’s participation is terminated.
The detailed calculations for all cases are described in Article 22.3.
2. Financial liability for recoveries
The financial liability for recoveries depends on the programme:
− for programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): the financial liability is as
follows:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation, but not intervene to recover this money (no debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole
amount that needs to be recovered (i.e. paid back to the granting authority)—
even if it has not been the final recipient of the concerned amount (debit note);
if the coordinator does not pay (irrespective of the reason), the granting
authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, drawing on the pre-
222EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
financing guarantee, joint and several liability of other beneficiaries or affiliated
entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see Article 22.4)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): each beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle
limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by their affiliated
entities. It is only for the contribution to the MIM that financial responsibility is
shared:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation and, if the beneficiary doesn’t pay, the granting authority may call
on the MIM to intervene and then start a recovery procedure against the
beneficiary for the account of the MIM (debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the contribution to the MIM will be used to
cover recoveries (if any); if the contribution is not sufficient, the coordinator
will be asked to pay back the amount owed (as representative of the
consortium); if the debt is not paid but the report on the distribution of
payments was provided, the granting authority will calculate the share of the
debt per beneficiary and confirm the amount to be recovered from each of
them separately (debit note); if they do not pay (irrespective of the reason),
the granting authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, joint and
several liability of affiliated entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see
Article 22.4); if the report on the distribution of payments was NOT provided,
the granting authority will enforce recovery against the coordinator (debit
note); if needed, the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and
will then continue recovery for the account of the MIM (second debit note
replacing the first)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note); no MIM intervention (new for 2021-
2027).
In addition, beneficiaries are always liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities
AND there may be specific joint and several liability regimes in case of enforced recoveries
(depending on the type of programme and Grant Agreement; see Article 22.4).
2.1Programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries, the granting authority will
recover the undue amounts:
from the coordinator if the recovery is at the final payment
from the beneficiary who owes the money (including undue amounts paid for costs declared
by its affiliated entities, if any) if the recovery is at beneficiary termination or after the final
payment.
In case of enforced recovery, i.e. when the coordinator/beneficiary does not pay the amount
owed, if the corresponding option has been activated (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4), the
granting authority may hold the beneficiaries jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of
another beneficiary under the Agreement (including late-payment interest)
recover also from the affiliated entities. The affiliated entity’s financial responsibility (for the
debt towards the granting authority) is limited to its maximum grant amount in Annex 2.For
more information on enforced recoveries see Article 22.4.
2.2. Programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries he granting authority will
recover the undue amounts from the beneficiary that owes the money (including undue
amounts paid for costs declared by its affiliated entities, if any).
223EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In case of recovery, each beneficiary’s financial responsibility is normally limited to its own
debt (which includes undue amounts paid for costs declared by its affiliated entities, if any).
If the granting authority has requested joint and several liability of an affiliated entity, it may
recover also from the affiliated entity in case of enforced recovery. The affiliated entity’s
financial responsibility (for the debt towards the granting authority) is limited to its maximum
grant amount in Annex 2.
For more information on enforced recoveries see Article 22.4.
3. Procedure
The basic procedure for recovery is almost always the same: After a contradictory
procedure, the granting authority claims repayment of the amounts and, if not paid, then
enforces recovery (see Article 22.4).
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention to recover (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms the amount to be recovered, and issues a debit note.
Specific cases:
Recoveries for beneficiary in insolvency/bankruptcy — If a beneficiary is in
insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings, the granting authority may have to act quickly in order
to submit its claims in accordance with the deadlines under the national
insolvency/bankruptcy procedures. If immediate action is needed, it will make a provisional
declaration and then complete the contradictory procedure with the beneficiary (and, if
needed, adjust or cancel the provisional declaration).

22.3.1 Pre-financing payments

22.3.1 Pre-financing payments
The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial pre-financings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2).
For additional pre-financings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment shows that
less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the
70% threshold and the amount used.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The contribution to the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism will be retained from the pre-financing payments (at the rate and in accordance with
the modalities set out in the Data Sheet, see Point 4.2) and transferred to the Mechanism.]
Pre-financing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts
owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
1. Pre-financing payments
Most programmes foresee the payment of pre-financing, in order to give beneficiaries a
sufficient float to start working on the action.
All pre-financing funds remain EU property until they are cleared against eligible
costs or contributions accepted by the granting authority (normally at final payment). The
pre-financing is therefore an advance payment. It will only become the property of the
beneficiaries when the granting authority approves the corresponding EU funding based on
eligible costs or contributions.
If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the initial pre-financing payment is
automatically paid after grant signature. The consortium does NOT need to submit a request
of payment to get it.
For additional pre-financings (if any), the consortium will be prompted to submit an
additional pre-financing report (which includes a statement on the use of the previous pre-
financing payment; see Article 21.2).
The ‘use’ of pre-financing does not necessarily correspond to incurring actual cost. Pre-
financing can be considered already used if in accordance with the usual accounting practice
of the beneficiary a corresponding amount has been committed (e.g. on subcontracts or
financial support to third parties (FSTP)) for the implementation of the action and cannot be
used for other commitments anymore.
225EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The additional pre-financing payment will be reduced if — according to the statement on use
of the previous pre-financing payment — less than 70% of the previous pre-financing was
used. In that case, the amount of the additional pre-financing set out in the Data Sheet will
be reduced by the difference between 70% of the previous pre-financing and the amount
actually used.
Example: The Data Sheet indicates that there will be an initial pre-financing of EUR 100 000
and one additional pre-financing of EUR 50 000. The consortium reports in the statement of the
use of previous pre-financing payment that only EUR 65 000 have been used so far. The
additional pre-financing payment will be:
{50 000 – ((100 000 x 0.7) – 65 000)} = 45 000
Pre-financing amount:
The amount of the initial and additional pre-financings (if any) are fixed by the granting
authority before grant signature (calculation usually based on a percentage of the maximum
grant amount in Annex 2). It will be lowered for additional pre-financings if the beneficiaries
used less than 70% of the previous pre-financing. The granting authority will inform the
coordinator about the amount paid in the pre-financing payment letter.
Specific cases (pre-financing payments):
Contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM) (HE only) — For programmes
with MIM, the contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism will be automatically deducted
from the initial pre-financing payment and transferred to the MIM (and then released at the
end of the action; see the specific cases on final payment in Article 22.3.4).
Example: For a grant with a maximum amount of EUR 1 000 000 and a 40% pre-financing rate,
EUR 50 000 (5% of the maximum grant amount) will be retained from the EUR 400 000 pre-
financing, resulting in a payment of EUR 350 000 to the coordinator.
Financial support to third parties (FSTP) — Where an action includes financial support to
third parties (e.g. in the form of grants), the commitments entered into by the beneficiaries
vis-à-vis their third parties receiving financial support can be included in the ‘additional pre-
financing report’ for the purpose of calculating the 70% usage threshold, even if no payments
have been made — provided it is the usual accounting practice of the beneficiaries to
consider the corresponding amounts as committed/used and thus no longer available for
other purposes.

General > Article 22.3.2 Beneficiary termination
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
In case of beneficiary termination, the granting authority will determine the provisional amount due for the
beneficiary concerned. Payments (if any) will be made with the next interim or final payment.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary for all reporting
periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the accepted
costs of the beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold
cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum
contributions and financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting amount is the
‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the distribution of
payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments received (if any)}.
If the balance is positive, the amount will be included in the next interim or final payment to the consortium.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be recovered and the
reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the
observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this amount to be paid to the
coordinator (confirmation letter).
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If payment is not made to the
coordinator by the date specified in the confirmation letter, the granting authority may call on the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism to intervene, if continuation of the action is guaranteed and the conditions set out in
the rules governing the Mechanism are met.
In this case, it will send a beneficiary recovery letter, together with a debit note with the terms and date for
payment.
The debit note for the beneficiary will include the amount calculated for the affiliated entities which also had
to end their participation (if any).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.]
The amounts will later on also be taken into account for the next interim or final payment.
227EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recoveries?
If a beneficiary is terminated and leaves the consortium, the granting authority must
provisionally close the accounts for that beneficiary.
The amount due at beneficiary termination will be calculated on the basis of the termination
report, the EU contribution already approved and the report on the distribution of payments
(see also Article 32). It will be equal to the accepted EU contribution minus payments
received by the beneficiary (pre-financing(s) and interim payments; if any).
If the terminated beneficiary is audited later on, but while the project is still ongoing, its
amount due will be re-calculated to determine the amount to recover. If the terminated
beneficiary is audited after the end of the project, the recovery will follow the standard rules
(revised final grant amount calculated).
2. Amount due
The amount due at beneficiary termination is the part of the grant which the beneficiary is
entitled to keep when they leave the project.
Calculation of the amount due at beneficiary termination:
Step 1 — Calculation of the accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
concerned, the granting authority will add the two following:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted costs for the beneficiary (i.e. costs declared in the interim and
termination reports and accepted by the granting authority; see Articles 6 and
27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount for
the beneficiary.
Depending on whether termination is initiated by the beneficiaries or the
granting authority, only costs incurred (see Article 6.1(a)) until end-of-work
date or date of which termination takes effect are eligible (except for costs for
the termination report). Costs relating to contracts due for execution (i.e.
delivery) after end-of-work/termination are NOT eligible (except for pillar-
assessed participants, see Article 10.3).
If the beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, the accepted EU contribution will
be this lower requested amount.
If the beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS,
see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the termination report
but fails to do so, the maximum EU contribution will be capped at the CFS
threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for
costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU contribution
to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the CFS, the maximum EU
contribution to costs will be capped at EUR 429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 60 days of the
date on which termination takes effect), costs and contribution that were not included in an
approved periodic financial report will NOT be taken into account for the calculation of the
accepted EU contribution. The granting authority will NOT send a written reminder and will
not extend the deadline.
228EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article
28), for example if the beneficiary has committed a serious breach of obligations
under the Grant Agreement, the EU contribution will be reduced (decreased)
accordingly. The final result will be the total accepted EU contribution for the
beneficiary.
Balance (amount to be paid or recovered):
The balance (amount to be paid or recovered) will be equal to the accepted EU contribution
minus payments received by the beneficiary (pre-financing(s) and interim payments; if any).
The amount of pre-financing(s) and interim payments received must be communicated to the
granting authority by the coordinator via the report on distribution of payments that must be
submitted as part of the termination (see Article 32.2.2). If the coordinator does not submit
the report on the distribution of payments, the terminated beneficiary will NOT have to repay
any amounts to the consortium.
If the amount due is positive (more accepted EU contribution than payments made), the
granting authority will include the difference in the next interim/final payment to the
consortium.
If the amount due is negative (less accepted EU contribution than payments made), the
beneficiary must pay back the difference, i.e. the money it received in excess, to the
consortium.
Example for calculating the amount due at beneficiary termination:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100 %. No contributions.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Accepted EU contribution: Beneficiary A goes bankrupt in the middle of the action and is terminated
at month 18 (of 36), just before the end of RP1.
Costs declared by beneficiary A in the termination report = EUR 62 500.
Costs rejected for beneficiary A following audit = EUR 12 500.
Accepted costs beneficiary A: EUR 62 500 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 50 000.
Application of funding rate: EUR 50 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Beneficiary balance: Payments received by beneficiary A (according to the report on the distribution
of payments): EUR 60 000.
Beneficiary A balance = EUR 50 000 (accepted EU contribution) – EUR 60 000 (payments received)
= EUR -10 000 (excess payments of EUR 10 000).
Recovery: Amount to be recovered from beneficiary A: EUR 10 000 (negative balance of EUR 10 000
must be returned to the consortium).
3. Procedure
I granting authority will inform the beneficiary concerned about the termination calculations
and give them the opportunity to provide observations (beneficiary termination calculation
letter and final letter).
If the balance is negative, a mechanism is needed to recover this amount and ensure that it
is paid back to the consortium (who will need the missing float to successfully complete the
project). The procedure depends on the type of programme (with or without MIM):
For programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE), the granting authority will
inform the beneficiary concerned about the amount that needs to be returned to the
consortium (and the obligation to do so). For the rest, this will however be treated as a
229EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
matter for the consortium to deal with, and the granting authority will therefore not intervene
any further.
For programmes with MIM (HE only), the granting authority will make sure that the
amount in question is recovered from the beneficiary concerned and injected back into the
consortium (debit note issued by the EU). If the beneficiary doesn’t honour the debit note,
the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and then recover the amount for the
MIM (if needed by enforcing the recovery, using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4).

General > Article 22.3.3 Interim payments
22.3.3 Interim payments
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible costs and contributions claimed for the implementation of the action
during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out the Data Sheet
(see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the reporting period, by
first calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the accepted costs of
each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold cappings
(if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and
financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary termination (if any).
The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
[OPTION for programmes with early pre-financing clearing (before reaching the interim payment ceiling):
If pre-financing clearing before reaching the interim payment ceiling is provided for in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2), the total accepted EU contribution will be lowered to clear the amount of pre-financing payments
previously made.]
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of pre-financing and interim payments (if
any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts owed
by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
1. Interim payments
During the project, the granting authority will make interim payments, if this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement.
The amount of the interim payments will be calculated on the basis of the costs and
contributions reported in the financial statements and the (previous pre-financing and/or
interim) payments already made.
Cost and contributions accepted in a periodic report may still be rejected later if a check,
review, audit or investigation finds out that they were not eligible.
231EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Calculation of interim payments:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution for the action for the
reporting period concerned, the granting authority will add the two following:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted costs reported in the financial statements (see Articles 6 and 27) by
the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount for the
consortium.
The following amounts will flow into the calculation of the maximum EU
contribution to costs for the interim payment to the consortium:
− If a beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, its accepted EU
contribution will be this lower requested amount.
− If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS, see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the
periodic report but fails to do so, its maximum EU contribution will be
capped at the CFS threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU
funding for costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the
requested EU contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not
submit the CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be capped at EUR
429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If during the reporting period the participation of a beneficiary was terminated and if a
grant reduction was applied to the terminated beneficiary, the amount of that grant
reduction will reduce the accepted EU contribution.
Step 2 — Capping the amount at the interim payments ceiling
If the total accepted EU contribution is more than the ceiling set out in the Data Sheet
(Point 4.2) minus the pre-financing(s) and previous interim payments, the payment
will be capped at that limit. The pre-financing clearing is automatically recorded with
costs above the interim payment threshold (normally 90%).
Examples for calculating interim payments:
Case 1:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 1 000 000 and 100% funding rate. No contributions.
Pre-financing of EUR 333 334.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 1 000 000 = EUR 900 000
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by the consortium for RP1: EUR 625 000.
After checking the reports EUR 25 000 claimed by beneficiary A and EUR 15 000 claimed by
beneficiary B are considered not eligible. The granting authority therefore rejects EUR 40 000.
Total accepted costs RP1: EUR 585 000.
Application of funding rate: 100% = EUR 585 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing = EUR 900 000 – EUR 333 334
[pre-financing payment] = EUR 566 666.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 566 666 [EUR 585 000
accepted contribution capped by the interim payment ceiling of EUR 900 000 minus pre-financing of
EUR 333 334].
232EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The difference between 566 666 and 585 000 will be cleared from the pre-financing.
Interim payment RP 2:
Total accepted costs RP2: EUR 162 500.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0 (the 90% ceiling of EUR
900 000 has already been reached after RP1: EUR 333 334 [pre-financing payment]+ EUR 566 666
[RP1 interim payment]).
The accepted cost will be used to further clear the pre-financing.
Case 2 (grant with terminated beneficiary):
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100%. No contributions.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 500 000 = EUR 450 000.
Beneficiary A was terminated before the end of RP1 and the amount due was its accepted costs :EUR 62
500 EUR (no grant reductions applied).
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by beneficiary A: EUR 62 500.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1: EUR 143 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1: EUR 112 500.
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 62 500 + EUR 143 750 + EUR 112 500 = EUR 318 750.
Some costs declared by beneficiary B are rejected for an amount of EUR 12 500. Total accepted costs
RP 1: EUR 318 750 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 306 250.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 306 250 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing = EUR 450 000 [ceiling] – EUR
200 000 [pre-financing payment] = EUR 250 000.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250 000 [EUR 306 250
accepted contribution capped by the interim payment ceiling of EUR 450 000 minus pre-financing of
EUR 333 334].
Case 3:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100%.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 500 000 = EUR 450 000.
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP1: EUR 118 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1: EUR 143 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1: EUR 112 500.
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 118 750 + EUR 143 750 + EUR 112 500 = EUR 375 000.
Some direct costs declared by beneficiary A are rejected for an amount of EUR 12 500.
Total accepted costs RP 1: EUR 375 000 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 362 500.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 362 500 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing: EUR 450 000 – EUR 200 000 = EUR
250 000.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250 000.
Interim payment RP2:
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP2: EUR 25 000.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP2: EUR 37 500.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP2: EUR 37 500.
Total costs declared RP2: EUR 25 000 + EUR 37 500 + EUR 37 500 = EUR 100 000.
Costs rejected for beneficiary B at RP2: EUR 12 500.
Costs rejected for beneficiary C at RP2: EUR 6 250.
233EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Total accepted costs RP2 = EUR 81 250.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 81 250 (total accepted EU contribution).
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0 (the 90% limit has already
been reached in RP1: EUR 200 000 + EUR 250 000 = EUR 450 000).
2. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the coordinator about the interim payment calculations and
give them the possibility to submit observations (payment letter and final letter).

General > Article 22.3.4 Final payment
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the remaining part of the eligible costs and
contributions claimed for the implementation of the action(if any).
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all reporting
periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the total
accepted costs of each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs, CFS
threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump
sum contributions and financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting amount is the
‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
If the resulting amount is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.2, it will be limited to
the latter.
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
If the no-profit rule is provided for in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2), the grant must not produce a profit (i.e.
surplus of the amount obtained following Step 2 plus the action’s revenues, over the eligible costs and
contributions approved by the granting authority).
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4), for beneficiaries that are
profit legal entities [OPTION for programmes with exception for revenues: [OPTION if selected for the call:
(— with the exception of [insert exceptions], which are not considered as revenues)]].
If there is a profit, it will be deducted in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of the eligible costs
approved by the granting authority (as compared to the amount calculated following Steps 1 and 2 minus the
contributions).
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of pre-financing and interim
payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{final grant amount
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments made (if any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The amount retained for the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism (see above) will be released and paid to the coordinator (in accordance with the rules
governing the Mechanism).]
235EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts owed by
a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
If [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): — despite the release of the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism contribution —] the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be recovered and
the reasons why
- [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): requesting a report on the
distribution of payments to the beneficiaries within 30 days of receiving notification and]
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
[OPTION 1 for programmes without Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations are submitted
(or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has received), it will confirm
the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with a debit note with the terms and date for
payment.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations are submitted (or
the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has received) and the coordinator
has submitted the report on the distribution of payments, it will calculate the share of the debt per
beneficiary, by:
(a) identifying the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:
{{{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action},
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments received by the beneficiary (if any)}}
and
(b) dividing the debt:
{{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned
divided by
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to point (a)}
multiplied by
the amount to be recovered}.
and confirm the amount to be recovered from each beneficiary concerned (confirmation letter), together
with debit notes with the terms and date for payment.
The debit notes for beneficiaries will include the amounts calculated for their affiliated entities (if any).
If the coordinator has not submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the granting authority will
recover the full amount from the coordinator (confirmation letter and debit note with the terms and date
for payment).]
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.
236EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Final payment — Recoveries?
At the final payment (payment of the balance), the granting authority must close the
accounts for the action.
The final payment amount (to be paid or recovered) will be calculated on the basis of the
costs and contributions reported in the financial statements and the payments already made.
Cost and contributions accepted in a periodic report may still be rejected later if a
check, review, audit or investigation finds out that they were not eligible.
2. Final grant amount
The final grant amount is the total EU contribution to which the consortium as a whole is
entitled to at the end of the action. It can never be higher than the maximum grant amount
in Annex 2, but it can be lower if there are insufficient total accepted eligible costs and
contributions or if the granting authority applies a grant reduction (see Article 28).
The final grant amount will depend on two types of criteria:
− implementation criteria, i.e. was the action implemented as described in Annex 1
and in accordance with the obligations set out in the Grant Agreement.
This is mostly a technical analysis by the granting authority of the work performed
during the action, as compared with the activities set out in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. If the action was not properly implemented, the granting authority may
decide to reduce the grant (see Article 28).
− financial criteria, including:
− the amount of (accepted) eligible costs and contributions
− the funding rate(s)
− the maximum grant amount (Annex 2)
− the profit.
Calculation of the final grant amount:
Step 1 — Total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the total accepted EU contribution for the action, the granting
authority will determine the following elements:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted eligible costs reported in the financial statements (see Articles 6
and 27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount
for the consortium.
− If a beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, its accepted EU
contribution will be this lower requested amount.
− If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS, see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the
periodic report but fails to do so, its maximum EU contribution will be
capped at the CFS threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
237EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: The beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for
costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU
contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the
CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be capped at EUR 429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article
28), for example due to improper implementation of the action, the EU contribution
will be reduced (decreased) accordingly. The final result will be the total accepted
EU contribution.
Step 2 — Limit to maximum grant amount
If the total accepted EU contribution is higher than the maximum grant amount for the
action in Annex 2, it will be capped at the maximum grant amount.
Step 3 — No-profit rule (if applicable; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2)
For entities that work for profit (in their usual activities), EU grants must not have the
purpose or effect of producing a profit during the action. Beneficiaries that are profit
legal entities (and that do not fall under any of the other exceptions, see below) must
therefore declare their revenues at the end of the action.
For the calculation of the profit, only the EU grant (and other EU grants, if any; see
Article 6.3) and the revenues from the action (e.g. from the sale of results, such as
products, services and publications, conference fees) are taken into account. Grants from
other donors for the action or for the activities of the beneficiaries (‘financial
contributions’) are NOT considered as revenue.
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4),
for beneficiaries that are profit legal entities. The revenue must be:
− established (i.e. revenue that has been collected AND entered in the accounts)
− generated (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but which has been
generated)
or
− confirmed (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but for which the
beneficiary has a commitment or written confirmation).
Exceptions: Only for-profit entities must declare revenues. In addition, certain types
of grants are exempted:
− actions with the objective to reinforce the financial capacity of the beneficiaries
(— this should be clear from the call)
− actions where the continuity after their end is to be ensured by the income
generated by the action (— this should be clear from the call)
− grants in the form of study, research or training scholarships paid to natural
persons or as other forms of direct support paid to natural persons who are
most in need (e.g. refugees, the unemployed)
− grants with a maximum amount of not more than EUR 60 000 (low value
grants)
Profit calculation and deduction: The declared revenues will be taken into account
by the system and the profit (if any) will be deducted from the amount resulting from
238EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of eligible costs (i.e. not the
entire profit is deducted, only an amount proportionate to the EU share of funding the
action):
{profit}
multiplied by
{final rate of reimbursement of the eligible costs}
The profit is calculated as follows:
{((amount after step 2 [the lower of total accepted EU contribution or maximum grant
amount]) plus action revenue) minus accepted eligible costs}
The final rate of reimbursement is distinct from the funding rate. It is the
proportion of EU funding, i.e. the eligible cost of the action compared to the final
grant amount. It is calculated as follows:
{(Amount after step 2 [the lower of total accepted EU contribution or maximum grant
amount]) divided by accepted eligible cost}
Balance — Payment or recovery:
The balance (amount to be paid or recovered) will be equal to the final grant amount minus
the payments already made to the consortium (pre-financing(s) and interim payments).
If the resulting amount is positive (final grant amount higher than payments made), the
granting authority will pay the difference as final payment.
If the resulting amount is negative (final grant amount lower than payments made), the
final payment will take the form of a recovery (the consortium will have to pay back the EU
contribution received in excess).
Example for calculating the final grant amount:
At the end of an action with a maximum grant amount of EUR 1 million and a funding rate of 70% the
beneficiary, a private IT-startup, submits the last periodic report for the final payment. The beneficiary
has declared eligible cost of EUR 1,7 million during all reporting periods. The financial statements of the
beneficiary show that profit was generated due to a ministry of a Member State procuring for EUR 800
000 a licence for the use of an IT tool developed under one of the work packages during the last
reporting period of the action. The grant does not provide for a specific exemption from the no-profit
rule.
Relevant data (see Data Sheet):
Exempted: No (no specific exemption under the grant, and no general exemption as the IT-startup is
a for-profit entity)
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 1 000 000
Funding rate: 70%
Accepted eligible cost: EUR 1 700 000
Revenue: EUR 800 000
Step 1 – Total accepted EU contribution: With a funding rate of 70% applied to the accepted
eligible cost of EUR 1 700 000, the maximum EU contribution to costs would be
EUR 1 700 000 x 0.7 = EUR 1 190 000.
Step 2 – Limit to maximum grant amount: However, the accepted EU contribution of EUR 1 190
000 amount is capped by the maximum grant amount to EUR 1 000 000.
Step 3 – No–Profit: The profit would be EUR 1 000 000 [EU grant from step 2 amount] + EUR 800
000 [revenue] – EUR 1 700 000 [accepted eligible cost] = EUR 100 000
The amount to be deducted would be the profit multiplied by the final rate of reimbursement:
EUR 100 000 [profit] x (EUR 1 000 000 [step 2 amount] / EUR 1 700 000 [accepted eligible cost]).
That is EUR 100 000 [profit] x 58,82% [final rate of reimbursement] = EUR 58 820
Final grant amount = EUR 1 000 000 [step 2 amount] – EUR 58 820 [profit deduction] = EUR 941

Specific cases (final payment):
Combining EU Synergy actions — If the same action received more than one source of EU
funding (only allowed for actions flagged as ‘Synergy action’, see Data Sheet, Point 1), at
final payment it needs to be ensured that the combined actual funding rates do not go
beyond 100% of the accepted eligible cost of the action and the total EU funding (of all EU
grants combined) will accordingly be taken into account for the calculation of revenue.
Income from exploitation of results (HE only) — For actions under Horizon Europe,
income generated by the exploitation of results are NOT considered as revenues. Exploitation
is defined in Annex 5 (e.g. commercialising a product or service).
Income from building up of reserves (operating grants in all programmes) — For
operating grants, amounts which are dedicated to the building up of reserves are NOT
considered as revenues.
Release of the contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM) (HE only) —
For programmes with MIM, the contribution to the MIM that was kept from the pre-financing
(see the specific cases on pre-financing in Article 22.3.1) must be released back to the
consortium.
If the balance is positive, the contribution will be released in a separate payment.
If the balance is negative, the amount to be recovered (debt) will be first compensated
against the MIM contribution released. If this amount is enough to cover the debt, the
recovery process ends here (the consortium will be paid out the remainder of the MIM
contribution, if any is left after the compensation). If the released contribution is not
sufficient to cover the debt, the rest will be recovered (see procedure below).
3. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the consortium about the final payment calculations and
give them the opportunity to provide observations (payment letter and final letter).
If the balance is negative, the amount needs to be recovered. The procedure depends on the
type of programme (with or without MIM).
For programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): At the payment of the
balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole amount that needs to be recovered (i.e.
paid back to the granting authority) — even if it has not been the final recipient of the
concerned amount.
Therefore, the coordinator will receive the final letter with a debit note for the full amount of
the debt of the consortium, with the instructions for payment. If the coordinator does not pay
the debt, the granting authority will enforce the recovery using the mechanisms set out in
Article 22.4.
For programmes with MIM (HE only):
The coordinator is not fully liable for the whole amount that needs to be recovered; each
beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid
for costs declared by their affiliated entities.
Therefore, the coordinator will receive a request to submit the report on the distribution of
payments (in the payment letter) and the negative balance (debt) will be split among the
beneficiaries that received more money than their share in the final grant amount (payments
in excess; based on their eligible costs and contributions). Each beneficiary’s share in the
debt is calculated using the formula:
{((total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary)
divided by
240EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
total accepted EU contribution for the action)
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action}
The negative balance will be then divided among those beneficiaries who received payments
in excess, in proportion to their relative share of the total payments in excess. Each of those
beneficiaries will receive a separate debit note for their share of the debt, with the
instructions for payment (beneficiary recovery letter).
For each beneficiary that does not pay their debt, the granting authority will enforce the
recovery using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4.
Beneficiaries who did not receive more money than their share of the final grant amount will
thus not have to contribute to the repayment of the negative balance. Similarly, the
coordinator is only liable for the full amount of the debt, if they did not submit the report on
the distribution of payments (only in this case will they receive a debit note for the full
amount).
Example (negative balance with MIM):
Grant with four beneficiaries: A, B, C, D.
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 3 000 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts: A= EUR
800 000; B= EUR 1 200 000; C= EUR 600 000; D= EUR 400 000).
Funding rate: 100 %.
MIM contribution: 5% of 3 000 000 = EUR 150 000.
Payments received: EUR 2 700 000 (EUR 150 000 retained for the MIM).
Final grant amount:
Total accepted costs: EUR 3 080 000.
Application of the funding rate: 100% = EUR 3 430 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Grant reduction of EUR 400 000
Accepted EU contribution: 3 080 0–0 - 400 000 = EUR 2 680 000.
Limit to maximum grant amount: not applicable (because maximum grant amount > accepted EU
contribution)
No receipts/profit.
Final grant amount: EUR 2 680 000
Balance & MIM release:
Payments made: EUR 2 700 000.
Balance: EUR 2 680 000 (final grant amoun–) - EUR 2 700 000 (payments made) = EUR -20 000 (excess
payments of EUR 20 000).
Compensating against MIM and release: EUR 150 000 – 20 000 = EUR 130 000.

General > Article 22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount — Recovery
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount — Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see Article 25) —
the granting authority rejects costs or contributions (see Article 27) or reduces the grant (see Article 28), it
will calculate the revised final grant amount for the beneficiary concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary, by
calculating the ‘revised accepted costs’ and ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total accepted EU
contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its share in the final
grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is calculated as
follows:
{{{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action}.
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the
observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with
a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.
1. Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery?
If there is an audit (or similar, such as for instance an OLAF investigation) after the end of
the action which finds ineligible costs or contributions (or breaches that require a grant
reduction), the granting authority will have to recalculate the grant for the beneficiary
concerned.
The amount to be recovered after the final payment will be calculated by comparing the
beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount (i.e. at the final payment of the grant) and the
beneficiary’s revised final grant amount (i.e. amount entitled to after the audit).
242EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Calculation of the revised final grant amount:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of revised accepted EU contribution for the
beneficiary concerned, the granting authority will consider the:
− maximum revised EU contribution to costs, which is the result of
multiplying the accepted costs for the beneficiary, after implementation of the
adjustments (see Articles 6, 25 and 27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and
sum them up to a total amount for the beneficiary.
− revised accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-
rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs after the
adjustments.
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article 28),
for example if the audit finds irregularities in the action implementation by the
beneficiary, the revised accepted EU contribution will be reduced (decreased)
accordingly. The final result will be the revised total accepted EU contribution for
the beneficiary.
Amount to be recovered:
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e.
its share in the final grant amount for the action), there will need to be a recovery of the
difference.
The beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount (what the beneficiary was entitled to, based
on its eligible costs and contributions, when the final payment was done) is:
{((total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary) divided by (total accepted EU contribution for
the action)) multiplied by final grant amount for the action}
The beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount is not necessarily equal to the money it
received from the coordinator. The consortium may have decided on a different distribution of
the EU funding. However, the amount to be recovered will be calculated using the
beneficiary’s notional share irrespectively of the amount it actually received from the
coordinator.
The amount to be recovered from the beneficiary will be:
{the beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount}
minus
{the beneficiary’s revised final grant amount}
2. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the beneficiary concerned about the audit implementation
calculations and give them the opportunity to provide observations (audit implementation
pre-information letter and final letter).
For the recovery process, see Article 22.2. If the beneficiary does not pay the debt, the
granting authority will enforce the recovery using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4.

General > Article 22.4 Enforced recoveries
22.4 Enforced recoveries
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts
owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may be offset
before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency,
debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) [OPTION 1 for programmes with pre-financing guarantees: by drawing on the financial
guarantee(s) (if any)][OPTION 2 for programmes without pre-financing guarantees: financial
guarantee(s): not applicable]
(c) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: by holding other
beneficiaries jointly and severally liable (if any; see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)] [OPTION 2 for
programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: joint and several liability of
beneficiaries: not applicable]
(d) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of affiliated entities: by holding
affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)][OPTION 2 for
programmes without joint and several liability of affiliated entities: joint and several liability of
affiliated entities: not applicable] or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that the granting authority is the European
Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable decision under Article 299 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation
2024/2509.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If the Mutual Insurance Mechanism
was called on by the granting authority to intervene, recovery will be continued in the name of the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism. If two debit notes were sent, the second one (in the name of the Mutual Insurance
Mechanism) will be considered to replace the first one (in the name of the granting authority). Where the
MIM intervened, offsetting, enforceable decisions or any other of the above-mentioned forms of enforced
recovery may be used mutatis mutandis.]
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 22.5,
from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the full payment is
received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against
the principal.
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless Directive 2015/236642
applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by offsetting or
enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission (see also Article 43).

1. Enforced recoveries
If the coordinator/beneficiary concerned does not pay a debit note by the specified deadline,
the granting authority will recover the amount (with interest at the rate set out in Article
22.5), in one of the following ways:
− by offsetting it
− for programmes with pre-financing guarantees (most programmes, except HE): by
drawing on the financial guarantee(s) (if any)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): by drawing on the Mutual Insurance
Mechanism (MIM), and then follow up with a debit note on behalf of the MIM against
the debtor (and continue the recovery procedure applying any of the other measures
to enforce the recovery)
− if the granting authority has requested joint and several liability: by calling upon
the beneficiary(ies) or affiliated entities concerned (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
or
− by either:
− taking legal action in a national court or the European Court of Justice (see
Article 43) or
− adopting a decision that is enforceable within the meaning of Article 299
TFEU38.39
‘Offsetting’ allows to directly deduct the amount owed by the coordinator/beneficiary from
any other amount that the granting authority owes to the coordinator/beneficiary. With the
offsetting, both amounts are considered paid.
Offsetting is normally implemented as a public law measure (i.e. directly on the
basis of Article 102 of the Financial Regulation 2024/2509). Therefore, the dispute
settlement normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU action; see Article
43.2).
For the cases not covered by the Financial Regulation, offsetting will however —
exceptionally — be implemented as a purely contractual measure (e.g. offsetting against
international organisations). In this case, the normal contractual means for dispute
settlement apply (i.e. Article 272 TFEU action, arbitration, etc; see Article 43.2).
Normally, offsetting is carried out after the deadline specified in the debit note has expired.
However, in exceptional circumstances, the granting authority may offset before this date in
38 See Article 299 TFEU: “Acts of the Council, the Commission or the European Central Bank which impose a
pecuniary obligation on persons other than States, shall be enforceable. Enforcement shall be governed by the
rules of civil procedure in force in the State in the territory of which it is carried out. The order for its
enforcement shall be appended to the decision, without other formality than verification of the authenticity of
the decision, by the national authority which the government of each Member State shall designate for this
purpose and shall make known to the Commission and to the Court of Justice of the European Union. When
these formalities have been completed on application by the party concerned, the latter may proceed to
enforcement in accordance with the national law, by bringing the matter directly before the competent authority.
Enforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court. However, the courts of the country concerned
shall have jurisdiction over complaints that enforcement is being carried out in an irregular manner.”
39 See Article 100(2) Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 100(2) Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
245EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
order to safeguard the EU financial interests (see Article 102(1) Financial Regulation
2024/250940).
If the offsetting takes place after the deadline for payment has expired, the interest must
also be offset. The interest is normally offset first, before the principal amount.
‘Drawing on the MIM’ is available only for programmes with MIM (HE only). For 2021-2027,
MIM interventions are limited to defaults in the context of beneficiary terminations and
negative payment of the balance (see Articles 22.3.2 and 22.3.4); the MIM can no longer be
called on to intervene after the payment of the balance (see Article 22.3.5).
‘Joint and several liability’ means to hold another participant liable for paying the debit note.
There are two types of joint and several liability:
− joint and several liabilities of beneficiaries (only for programmes without MIM; all
programmes except HE) — ONLY if selected by the granting authority during grant
preparation; check the Data Sheet
− joint and several liability of affiliated entities (all programmes) — ONLY if selected by
the granting authority during grant preparation; check the Data Sheet
These joint and several liability regimes are subject to ceilings. Affiliated entities are
generally only liable up to their maximum grant amount in Annex 2. This is also the default
option for beneficiaries (‘limited liability’), but for them the granting authority may also select
another option (either up to the maximum grant amount for the action (‘unconditional
liability’) or no joint and several liability (‘individual liability’)).
‘Enforceable decisions’ are public law decisions, taken directly on the basis of Article 100(2)
of the Financial Regulation 2024/250941. The decision will contain a summary of the claim,
state that the debtor has not paid its debt (despite having been sent a debit note and several
reminders) and indicate the amount of the debt. The decision — duly endorsed with the order
for enforcement issued by the competent authority in the Member State concerned — allows
to have the debtor’s assets seized. Since they are public law decisions, the dispute
settlement normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU action; see Article
43.2).
Specific case (recoveries):
International organisations (IOs) — Enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU (and
other public law decisions) will NOT be taken against international organisations where this
would be contrary to the privileges and immunities accorded by their constituent documents
or international law (see Article 10.2).
Offsetting (see Article 102 of the Financial Regulation 2024/250942) is — by contrast — a
measure that may be taken in relation to international organisations, however NOT as public
law measure as such but as a purely contractual measure (on the basis of Article 22.4 of the
Grant Agreement). Offsetting for international organisations will therefore be subject to the
contractual means for dispute settlement (i.e. arbitration; see Article 43.2).

22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the beneficiaries are
entitled to late-payment interest at the rate applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) for its main
refinancing operations in euros (‘reference rate’), plus the rate specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The
reference rate is the rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the coordinator only on
request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional and local
government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State for the purpose of this
Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not be considered
as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for payment (see
above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.
22.5.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see
Article 29) and the grant or the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Late-payment interest (to be paid by the EU)
If the granting authority pays late, i.e. beyond the payment deadlines, it will automatically
pay the consortium late payment interest for the overdue period unless:
− all beneficiaries in the Grant Agreement are Member States or entities acting on behalf
of Member States or
− the deadline for payment is actually not overdue because the payment deadline is
formally suspended (see Article 29) or payments are formally suspended (see Article
30) or
− the amount of the late-payment interest is not higher than EUR 200, in which case it
will only be paid upon request from the coordinator.
Late-payment interest is paid separately and on top of the grant amounts.
Late-payment interest may also be due from the beneficiaries, if they must pay back
undue amounts in the context of a recovery and are late with this payment (see Article 22.2).

If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2), the beneficiaries must provide (one or more)
pre-financing guarantee(s) in accordance with the timing and the amounts set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them to the granting authority in due time before the pre-financing they are
linked to.
The guarantees must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the following
conditions:
(a) be provided by a bank or approved financial institution established in the EU or — if requested by
the coordinator and accepted by the granting authority — by a third party or a bank or financial
institution established outside the EU offering equivalent security
(b) the guarantor stands as first-call guarantor and does not require the granting authority to first have
recourse against the principal debtor (i.e. the beneficiary concerned) and
(c) remain explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the form of a
recovery, until five months after the debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
They will be released within the following month.
23.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If the beneficiaries breach their obligation to provide the pre-financing guarantee, the pre-financing will not
be paid.
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.]
1. Pre-financing guarantees (most programmes, except HE)
What? For programmes that allow for pre-financing guarantees (most programmes except
HE), a guarantee may be required in particular where the financial capacity checks of one (or
more) of the beneficiaries in the consortium reveal weaknesses. The guarantee will be asked
from the coordinator, for the entire consortium. It allows the granting authority to protect
itself against the risk of losing pre-financing (i.e. the consortium not being able to honour a
recovery debt at the end of the action).
When? Where required by the granting authority, guarantees are a prerequisite for paying
out the pre-financing. They are therefore usually requested during grant preparation and
have to be provided by the coordinator before grant signature.
However, the obligation to provide a valid guarantee continues to apply during the entire
project. If for any reason the guarantee becomes invalid (e.g. because the issuing bank
ceases its operations), it needs to be replaced by a new guarantee. If the coordinator
refuses to provide a new guarantee, the grant can be terminated.
248EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
How? Pre-financing guarantees usually take the form of a guarantee by a bank or other
approved financial institution established in the EU. The costs for obtaining such a guarantee
can be declared as eligible cost under the Grant Agreement. If accepted by the granting
authority, guarantees can also be obtained from other providers (e.g. subsidiaries may obtain
a guarantee from their parent company).
The pre-financing guarantee must be sent by the coordinator as original (by registered post
with proof of delivery OR courier service) to the postal address of the granting authority.

preclude the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) or the
European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) from using their prerogatives for audits and investigations under the
Agreement (see Article 25).
If the costs (or a part of them) were already audited by the granting authority, these costs do not need to be
covered by the certificate and will not be counted for calculating the threshold (if any). ]
43 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and
consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. Certificate on the financial statements
What? If a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) is required for an interim or final
payment, the beneficiaries (and affiliated entities) concerned must provide it as part of the
periodic reporting (see Article 21.2).
The CFS is a certificate covering the actual costs and costs (or contributions) according to
usual accounting practices contained in a financial statement.
It is based on agreed-upon procedures within the meaning of International Standard on
Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (revised) for Agreed-upon Procedures Engagements issued by
the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
Provided that the provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC (or similar standards) are complied
with, the participant is free to choose a qualified external auditor, including its usual
external auditor:
251EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘qualified’ means qualified in accordance with national legislation implementing
Directive 2006/4343 (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive)
− ‘external’ means the auditor is independent from the participant.
In accordance with the agreed-upon procedures set out in the CFS, the CFS auditor must
report on the correct declaration of cost in the financial statement, i.e. that they are
accurately recorded in the beneficiary’s accounting system and eligible.
The CFS auditor has to explain findings of deviation from the rules (for any reason) in detail
in the certificate. The granting authority will consider the explanation in light of the facts
reported by the auditor, and decide on steps to take.
If the auditor finds discrepancies/exceptions, the cost item should normally not be
included in the financial statement submitted to the granting authority (and does not need to
be mentioned in the CFS). However, if the issue cannot be rectified by excluding the costs
from the financial statement or is of more serious systemic nature, it should be reported to
the EU project officer in charge of your grant.
When & How? The CFS must be provided by the beneficiary concerned, as part of their
financial report, directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool. The template is available there
for download.
The CFS threshold and schedule are set out in the Data Sheet, Point 4.3. It depends on the
amount of EU contribution requested (new for 2021-2027: not only the amount of actual
costs and unit costs according to usual cost accounting practices declared) and is calculated
automatically by the system for each entity separately; i.e. each beneficiary/affiliated entity
must submit a CFS if they reach the threshold (without taking into account the EU
contribution requested by the others).
If the participation of the beneficiary in the grant has been audited by they granting
authority, costs and contributions covered by the audit are NOT counted for the
threshold. If nevertheless the beneficiary reaches the threshold (after deducting the costs
and contributions audited) those do not need to be covered (again) by the CFS.
If a certificate is required, it must cover all applicable cost categories set out in the template.
The costs of a required CFS are eligible under the applicable cost category (usually category
C.3 as a cost for services). The costs for CFS that are not mandatory (e.g. because the
threshold was not reached or because it was not required in that reporting period) are NOT
eligible (because not necessary for the action).
Examples (errors):
Grant Agreement with 2 reporting periods (an interim reporting period and a final)
Point 4.3 of the Data Sheet: CFS mandatory only at final payment and only if requested EU
contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000
Beneficiary A submits a CFS with the reports of the interim reporting period: the costs of the CFS
are not eligible (wrong timing)
Beneficiary B requests EUR 380 000 of EU contribution and submits a CFS at the final payment: the
costs of the CFS are not eligible (wrong threshold)

annual accounts and consolidated accounts, amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and
repealing Council Directive 84/253/EEC (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
252EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The CFS does not affect the granting authority’s right to carry out its own assessment or
audits. Neither does the reimbursement of costs covered by a certificate preclude the
granting authority, the European Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), the
European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) or the European Court of Auditors from carrying
out checks, reviews, audits and investigations in accordance with the Grant Agreement.
Specific case (CFS):
Public bodies — Public bodies can choose an external auditor or an independent public
officer. In this case, independence is usually defined as independence ‘in fact and in
appearance’ (e.g. that the officer is not involved in drawing up the financial statements). It is
for each public body to appoint the public officer and ensure their independence. The
certificate should refer to this appointment.
Pillar-assessed entities — Pillar-assessed participants can choose their regular internal or
external auditors in accordance with their internal financial regulations and procedures as
assessed by the European Commission in accordance with Article 157(3) of the Financial
Regulation 2024/250944 (see Article 10.3).

unit, flat rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to usual costs accounting practices (if any) may
submit to the granting authority, for approval, a certificate on the methodology stating that their usual cost

(a) be provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent and complies with
Directive 2006/43/EC43 (or for public bodies: by a competent independent public officer)
(b) the verification must be carried out according to the highest professional standards to ensure that the
methodology for declaring costs according to usual accounting practices complies with the
provisions under the Agreement.
If the certificate is approved, amounts declared in line with this methodology will not be challenged
subsequently, unless the beneficiary concealed information for the purpose of the approval.]

1. Certificate on the compliance of the methodology for usual cost accounting
practices (CoMUC) (DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM)
What? For programmes where costs (or contributions) according to usual accounting
practices are eligible (DEP, EDF, CEF? UCPM) beneficiaries (and affiliated entities) that use
these accounting practices to charge costs under their grants may submit a certificate on the
compliance of usual cost accounting practices (CoMUC) to the granting authority for approval.
The CoMUC is a certificate covering the methodology that is used to charge costs (or
contributions) according to usual cost accounting practices.
It is a certificate based on agreed-upon procedures within the meaning of International
Standard on Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (revised) for Agreed-upon Procedures
Engagements issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
Provided that the provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC (or similar standards) are complied
with, the participant is free to choose a qualified external auditor, including its usual
external auditor:
254EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘qualified’ means qualified in accordance with national legislation implementing
Directive 2006/4345 (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive)
− ‘external’ means the auditor is independent from the participant.
When & How? Requests for approval can be submitted at any time to the granting authority
of an ongoing grant.
Best practice: In order to ensure that the auditor has enough information to get assurance on
the methodology, it is recommended to request it only after the first reporting period has
passed.
Approval is limited to the (cost) accounting practices described and certified in the certificate.
Approval is valid for:
− all grants of the beneficiary under the EU programme for which it was submitted (it is
not limited to a single grant)
− all costs and contributions declared according to the certified accounting practices,
including costs and contributions declared before the granting authority approval (if
the beneficiary can show that they were declared according to the approved
practices).
If the granting authority approves the CoMUC, it will afterwards not challenge any amounts
that the beneficiary declares using the certified methodology — unless information was
concealed or fraud or corruption was used to obtain the approval.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should nevertheless keep detailed records and other supporting
documents (to prove that their methodology complied with the rules, if necessary).
If the beneficiary changes its accounting practices, the certificate does not apply to any
cost incurred under the changed accounting practices. The beneficiary may submit another
request for approval to the granting authority for the new practices.
If the beneficiary declares personnel costs according to the changed cost accounting
practices before the new certificate is approved, it bears the full risk of non-approval and
cost rejection by the granting authority.
If the beneficiary also has grants in other EU programmes with similar cost eligibility rules,
the CoMUC can in principle also be relied on for these other programmes. However, it is at
the discretion of the granting authorities of those other programmes, whether they consider
their rules as equivalent and accept the CoMUC also for their programme.
The costs of the CoMUC are NOT eligible and cannot be charged to the EU action (because
not necessary for the action — the CoMUC is not mandatory and not linked to a specific
action).
Specific case (CoMUC):
Public bodies — Public bodies can choose an external auditor or an independent public
officer. In this case, independence is usually defined as independence ‘in fact and in

for each public body to appoint the public officer and ensure their independence. The
certificate should refer to this appointment.

24.4 Systems and process audit (SPA)
[OPTION 1 by default: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with SPA: Beneficiaries which:
- use unit, flat rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to documented (i.e. formally
approved and in writing) usual costs accounting practices (if any) or
- have formalised documentation on the systems and processes for calculating their costs and
contributions (i.e. formally approved and in writing), have participated in at least […] actions under
[insert name of previous programme, e.g. Horizon 2020] and participate in at least […] ongoing
actions under [insert name of current programme, e.g. Horizon Europe]
may apply to the granting authority for a systems and process audit (SPA).
This audit will be carried out as follows:
Step 1 — Application by the beneficiary.
Step 2 — If the application is accepted, the granting authority will carry out the systems and process
audit, complemented by an audit of transactions (on a sample of the beneficiary’s [insert name
of current programme, e.g. Horizon Europe] financial statements).
Step 3 — The audit result will take the form of a risk assessment classification for the beneficiary: low,
medium or high.
Low-risk beneficiaries will benefit from less (or less in-depth) ex-post audits (see Article 25) and a higher
threshold for submitting certificates on the financial statements (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data
Sheet, Point 4.3). ]
1. Combined review (SPA)
The provision is only used by Horizon Europe and open only to a relatively small group of
beneficiaries that fulfil the criteria (repetitive and frequent participation in several consecutive
programmes required). If needed, the granting authority will provide guidance directly to the
beneficiaries concerned.

If a beneficiary does not submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) or the certificate is rejected,

If a beneficiary breaches any of its other obligations under this Article, the granting authority may apply the
measures described in Chapter 5. ]
1. Missing CFS
If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS, see Articles 21
and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) but fails to do so, their maximum EU contribution to
costs will be capped at the CFS threshold in the Data Sheet minus one Euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for costs.
According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU contribution to costs ≥ EUR
430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be
capped at EUR 429 999.

25.1.1 Internal checks
The granting authority may — during the action or afterwards — check the proper implementation of the
action and compliance with the obligations under the Agreement, including assessing costs and contributions,
deliverables and reports.
1. Checks (by the granting authority)
What & When? The granting authority may — at any moment including after the end —
check aspects relating to the grant relating to the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples:
1. After receiving the reports (see Article 21), the granting authority checks the different
documents (explanation of the work carried out, overview of the progress, explanation of the
use of resources, etc.), for consistency with the description and work plan of the action.
2. The granting authority performs a plagiarism check on documents submitted by the
consortium.
3. After receiving information about misconducts concerning an entity that participates in EU
actions, the granting authority checks all the grant in order to see if it needs to take action.
4. After the end of the action, the granting authority receives a complaint by one of the
beneficiaries that another beneficiary does not respect its intellectual property obligations and
decides to look into this allegation.
These checks may concern beneficiaries or other partners involved in the action — which is
why beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights towards
other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties providing in-kind
contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)) by
including appropriate clauses in their contracts with them, see Articles 8 and 9.
Checks themselves are internal, i.e. usually carried out directly by staff of the granting
authority based on available documents. If needed, the granting authority may, however,
request information from the beneficiaries (see Article 19.1).
Example: An internal check shows that the beneficiaries did not clearly explain the allocation
and use of resources in their periodic report. The granting authority asks for more information
by a given date.
The granting authority may carry out these checks on its own or with the assistance of
external expert(s) — without asking the beneficiaries for approval before appointing them.
In this case, the granting authority will ensure that there is no conflict of interest by asking
the expert(s) to sign a declaration.
259EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the check shows ineligible costs or contributions or serious breach of obligations, this may
lead to rejection or grant reduction and, if necessary, recovery (see Articles 27, 28 and 22.2)
or any other measure mentioned in Chapter 5.
If a more in-depth examination is required, the granting authority may start a review or an
audit.

General > Article 25.1.2 Granting authority project reviews
25.1.2 Project reviews
25.1.2 Project reviews
The granting authority may carry out reviews on the proper implementation of the action and compliance
with the obligations under the Agreement (general project reviews or specific issues reviews).
Such project reviews may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out
in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned
and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent, outside experts. If it uses outside experts,
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right to object on grounds of
commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline
requested — any information and data in addition to deliverables and reports already submitted (including
information on the use of resources). The granting authority may request beneficiaries to provide such
information to it directly. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings, including with the
outside experts.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises (including to the
outside experts) and must ensure that information requested is readily available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
On the basis of the review findings, a project review report will be drawn up.
The granting authority will formally notify the project review report to the coordinator or beneficiary
concerned, which has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations.
Project reviews (including project review reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed with the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
1. Project reviews (by the granting authority)
What? The granting authority may — at any moment and until the time-limit set out in the
Data Sheet (Point 6) — carry out a project review.
Reviews normally concern mainly the technical implementation of the action, but they may
also cover financial and budgetary aspects or compliance with other obligations under the
Grant Agreement. They usually concern the entire project, but may exceptionally also focus
on issues related to only one specific beneficiary.
They may also extend to other participants involved in the action — which is why
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights also towards
those other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients
of financial support to third parties (FSTP)) by including appropriate clauses in their contracts
with them, see Articles 8 and 9.
Project reviews consist in an in-depth examination (often done with the help of independent
experts) of the progress of the action, and in particular:
− the degree to which the work plan has been carried out and whether all expected
deliverables were completed
− whether the objectives of the action are still relevant
261EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− how resources were planned and used in relation to the achieved progress, and if their
use respected the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness
− the management procedures and methods of the action
− the beneficiaries’ contributions and integration within the action
− for Horizon Europe: the expected potential scientific, technological, economic,
competitive and social impact, and plans for using and disseminating results.
For some types of action, they are done regularly (e.g. for the periodic reports related to a
payment, to help the granting authority to properly assess the action implementation and the
work carried out by the beneficiaries), for others they are done ad hoc.
If the review shows ineligible costs or contributions, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud
or serious breach of obligations (including non- or improper implementation of the action as
described in Annex 1), this may lead to suspension, termination, rejection, grant reduction
and recovery (see Articles 30, 31, 32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and to exclusion and/or financial
penalties (see Article 34).
If carried out during the implementation of the action, a review may also recommend
reorientations to the action.
2. Procedure
How? The review will be initiated by a project review invitation letter sent to the
coordinator (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary concerned) through the Portal.
The letter will also mention the names of the independent experts that have been appointed
(if any). The consortium may object to an expert, but only on the grounds of commercial
confidentiality or conflict of interests.
The review may include on-the-spot visits or a review meeting (on the granting authority
premises or anywhere relevant for the action). If there is a meeting, the invitation will
indicate the documents that will be discussed, normally:
− Annex 1 (the contractual description of the action against which the assessment will
be made)
− for periodic reviews: the periodic report(s) (technical and financial) for the period(s)
under review (including documents related to financial/budgetary issues)
− deliverables that were due
− for final reviews: the periodic reports (technical and financial) for all periods (including
documents related to financial/budgetary issues).
The results of the review will be recorded in a project review report.
The project review report together with the granting authority comments will be notified to
the coordinator (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary concerned), who will have 30 days to
submit observations (contradictory project review procedure; not to be confused with
the separate contradictory procedure for any subsequent rejection, grant reduction or
suspension/termination procedure under Articles 27, 28, 31 and 32).
The granting authority operational services (authorising officers) will analyse the comments
received and decide on the follow-up, if any.

General > Article 25.1.3 Granting authority audits
25.1.3 Audits
25.1.3 Audits
The granting authority may carry out audits on the proper implementation of the action and compliance with
the obligations under the Agreement.
Such audits may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the beneficiary concerned and will be considered to
start on the date of the notification.
The granting authority may use its own audit service, delegate audits to a centralised service or use external
audit firms. If it uses an external firm, the beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right to object
on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline requested — any
information (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data) to verify
compliance with the Agreement. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with
Article 13.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises (including for the
external audit firm) and must ensure that information requested is readily available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which has 30 days from
receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and will be formally
notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
1. Audits (by the granting authority)
What? The granting authority may — at any moment and up until the time-limit set out in
the Data Sheet (Point 6) — carry out an audit.
Record-keeping — Once an audit has started, the beneficiary must keep ALL the
records and supporting documents until the audit procedure AND its follow-up (including
rejection, grant reduction, recovery and litigation) are completed.
Example: If the beneficiary archives the paper copies of the original supporting documentation not on
its premises, the documentation must be retrieved and sent there in time for the audit fieldwork.
Audits normally focus the financial implementation of the action by a beneficiary (i.e. financial
and budgetary implementation), but they may also cover technical aspects or compliance
with other obligations under the Grant Agreement (i.e. an in-depth examination of the
implementation of the action by the beneficiary). This examination is carried out by
professional (external or granting authority in -house) auditors according to generally
accepted audit standards.
They may also extend to other participants involved in the action — which is why
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights also towards
those other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients
263EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
of financial support to third parties (FSTP) and, for HE, also third parties providing in-kind
contributions) by including appropriate clauses in their contracts with them, see Articles 8
and 9.
With the exception of affiliated entities (who are usually audited directly; see specific cases
below), the audit procedure for any third party will formally be with the beneficiary and the
beneficiary will be responsible for ensuring that the auditors have access to all necessary
documents and to carry out checks on the third party’s premises.
If the audit shows, ineligible costs or contributions, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud
or serious breach of obligations, this may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection,
grant reduction and recovery (see Articles 30, 31, 32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and, in very serious
cases, to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see Article 34). In some cases, findings may
result in the acceptance of additional costs (if the beneficiary declared them).
Specific cases (audits):
Affiliated entities — In contrast to other third parties, the granting authority will audit
affiliated entities, as if they are beneficiaries. The audit will be carried out on the premises of
the affiliated entity and all communication concerning the audit will be carried out directly
with it (e.g. audit initiation letter, contradictory audit procedure; audit result
implementation). However, since the financial consequences in case of recovery would
normally have to be borne by the beneficiary to which the entity is affiliated (see Article
22.2), the granting authority will also notify the beneficiary about launching the audit, as well
as about a summary of its conclusions.
Audits for periodical assessment of eligible costs or contributions based on units,
lump sums and flat rates — The European Commission may also audit the accounting
records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost items for which
it has fixed unit costs or contributions, flat-rates or lump-sums (for statistical purposes or to
gather data to assess their adequacy). Such audits will normally have no direct consequences
for the beneficiaries that were audited; even if the actual costs turn out to be lower, this will
not lead to a rejection of costs (— except in exceptional cases e.g. where the audit reveals
non-compliance with other obligations, e.g. under national law or wrongful information in the
proposal, etc).
2. Procedure
How? The audit will be initiated by a letter of announcement (LoA) sent to the beneficiary
(or affiliated entity) concerned through the Portal.
If the granting authority uses an external audit firm, this letter will mention its name. The
beneficiary may object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interests
(together with the reasons why) and — if justified — the granting authority may decide to
appoint another external auditor (or, in exceptional circumstances, to carry out the audit
itself).
The audit usually involves a desk review of the documents requested from the beneficiary
and an on-the-spot visit (i.e. on the beneficiary’s premises or on the site on which the
action is being implemented). There may however also be audits that consist only in a desk
review.
The auditors will request access to a wide range of records and documentation (e.g. payslips,
labour contracts, complete statutory accounts, etc.) and will indicate how and when it must
be provided (and in which format).
The beneficiary must provide the auditors with all requested information, records and
supporting documents (in the format and within the deadline specified).
Example: A hard copy list of records from the general ledger (accounting document) disclosing
hundreds or thousands of transactions is impossible to process manually, therefore the auditors will
normally require an electronic version.
264EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Objections based on data protection or confidentiality will NOT be accepted. Where the
records and documentation contain personal data, the granting authority will process it in
compliance with Regulation 2018/1725 and the beneficiary must inform the persons
concerned about this processing (see Article 15.1).
Confidential data will be processed in accordance with Article 13.
Failure to provide the requested information (in the requested format and within the specified
deadline) will lead to the rejection of costs or contributions (and possibly other measures,
such as recovery, suspension of payments, termination, administrative and financial
penalties, etc.).
For on-the-spot audits, the beneficiary must allow access to its premises and ensure that all
records and supporting documentation are readily available. This includes granting access to
research facilities and interviewing the researchers that worked on the action.
The results of the audit will be recorded in an audit report.
The draft audit report will be sent to the beneficiary concerned, who will have 30 days to
submit observations (contradictory audit procedure; not to be confused with the separate
contradictory procedure for any subsequent rejection or grant reduction under Articles 27 and
28).
The audit procedure will be closed (by the granting authority auditors) with the final audit
report and the audit letter of conclusion (LoC) — and the file will then be passed on to
the granting authority for the follow-up, if any.
Please do NOT take any immediate action at this point — even if the audit found ineligible
costs/breaches. Do NOT deduct them from the next financial statement. The proposed
adjustments must first be analysed and will, if needed, be implemented by the granting authority
at the next payment. You will be informed by payment letter/audit implementation pre-information
letter and have another possibility to submit observations.

General > Article 25.2 Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting authorities
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights of checks,
reviews and audits as the granting authority.
1. Checks, reviews and audits (by the European Commission)
EU grants are often not managed by the European Commission itself, but by legally separate
entities such as EU executive agencies or joint undertakings. The European Commission is in
these cases not the granting authority but does retain equivalent rights for checks, reviews
and audits.
Where the European Commission conducts such a check, review or audit of an action of
another granting authority, the guidance provided above applies mutatis mutandis, see
Articles 25.1.1, 25.1.2, 25.1.3.

25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the periodic
assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.
1. Access to assess simplified forms of funding (by the European Commission)
The European Commission may access the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain
general information about real costs of cost items for which it has fixed unit costs or
contributions, flat-rates or lump-sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data to assess
their adequacy). Such access will normally have no direct consequences for the beneficiaries.
Even if the actual costs turn out to be lower than the simplified form of funding, this will not
lead to a rejection of costs.

25.4 OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
The following bodies may also carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations — during the action or
afterwards:
- the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) under Regulations No 883/201344 and No 2185/9645
- the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) under Regulation 2017/1939
- the European Court of Auditors (ECA) under Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU
(TFEU) and Article 263 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If requested by these bodies, the beneficiary concerned must provide full, accurate and complete information
in the format requested (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data,
including in electronic format) and allow access to sites and premises for on-the-spot visits or inspections —
as provided for under these Regulations.
To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the action, at least until
the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until any ongoing checks, reviews, audits,
investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have been concluded.

15/11/1996, p. 2).
1. OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
In addition to the granting authority and the European Commission, you can also have a
check, review, audit or investigation from any of the following:
− the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF): OLAF is the EU’s anti-fraud office,
responsible for investigating fraud against the EU budget.
If the granting authority suspects that a beneficiary or third party involved in an
action committed fraud or other illegal acts, it will inform OLAF (and/or EPPO), who
may decide to investigate.
OLAF will send the outcome of the investigation to the granting authority, who will
then decide how to proceed.
− the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO): EPPO is an independent and
decentralised prosecution office of the European Union, with the competence to
investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment crimes against the EU budget, such as
fraud, corruption or serious cross-border VAT fraud.
− the European Court of Auditors (ECA): ECA is the independent external auditing
body for all European institutions. As such, it may carry out audits on all recipients of
EU funds (including beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners,
subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) and, for HE,
also third parties providing in-kind contributions).
268EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Depending on the outcome, the results of such an audit may be notified to the
beneficiary.
These bodies are not subject to the time-limits for audits and reviews set out in the Data
Sheet (Point 6) for the granting authority. They may carry out their activities at any point
during or after the action.
If the check, review, audit or investigation shows ineligible costs or contributions,
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations, it may lead
to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant reduction and recovery (see Articles 30, 31,
32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and, in very serious cases, to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see
Article 34).

25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant may lead to
rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount (see Article
22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may lead to a request
for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach
of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal prosecution under
national law.
1. Consequences of findings in this grant and extension to other grants
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to any of the measures described in Chapter 5 (i.e. cost rejections, grant
reductions, suspension, termination, etc).
If they find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations, this
may also lead to consequences in other EU grants awarded under similar conditions
(‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings leading to OLAF or EPPO investigations may also lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.

General > Article 25.5.2 Extension from other grants
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Results of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar conditions, to have
committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations that have a
material impact on this grant and
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the list of grants
affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to extend the findings
and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of costs or contributions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or recurrent errors, to
calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or recurrent errors
and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations, revised financial
statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the implementation (i.e.
start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the revised financial statements or the
announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see Articles 27 and 28).
1. Extension of findings from other grants
Findings from other EU grants may also impact the grant. Article 25.5.2 alloIhe granting
authority to apply measures (e.g. cost rejection or grant reduction) , if there were issues in
other EU grants in which the beneficiary participates or participated (i.e. including past
grants), provided that the extension is notified within the audit time limit (see DataSheet,
Point 6), and the findings have:
− ‘systemic or recurrent’ nature, meaning not just an individual occurrence in one
other grant but something expected to affect all similar activities of the beneficiary
also in other grants
Example (extension): During an audit of another grant, the granting authority detected
systematic irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs (e.g. recurrent errors in the time-
recording systems for personnel). The beneficiary has used the same practice in all EU grants.
271EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘similar conditions’, meaning that the other grant contains obligations that are
similar enough to the obligations of the present grant that errors in the other grant
would also be errors under the rules of the present grant.
Example (no extension): During an audit of the beneficiary’s participation in another grant,
the granting authority detected recurrent errors in the record of actual cost for travel and
subsistence. However, in the present grant the beneficiary uses unit cost for travel and
subsistence. Therefore other rules apply an errors in the actual cost do not affect the unit cost
under the present grant (in this case).
− ‘material impact on this grant’, meaning that findings in other grants must be
relevant in the context of implementation of the present grant, i.e. leading to a
measurable error.
Example (no extension): During an audit of another grant, the granting authority detected
systematic (accidental) errors in the calculation of depreciation of equipment of the beneficiary.
While the present grant follows the same cost eligibility rules on equipment, the beneficiary has
only declared personnel and subcontracting costs for the implementation of the present grant.
Therefore, findings on equipment costs in other grants have no impact on the present grant.
2. Procedure
How? The audit extension procedure will be initiated as part of the letter of audit
conclusions (LoC) and the beneficiary concerned will be asked to provide further
documents and information and observations.
Once the necessary documents and information are received, the audit extension procedure
will be closed (by the granting authority auditors) with the audit extension complete
letter — and the file will then be passed on to the granting authorities of the concerned
projects for the follow-up, if any.
Please do NOT take any immediate action at this point. The proposed extensions must
first be analysed and will, if needed, be implemented by the granting authorities of the
concerned projects. You will be informed by payment letter/audit implementation pre-
information letter and have another possibility to submit observations.

General > Article 25.5.2 Consequences of non-compliance
25.5.2 Consequences of non-compliance
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions insufficiently
substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 27), and the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Refusal to give access for checks, reviews, audits or investigations
The beneficiaries (and through Article 9 also the other partners involved in the action) are
obliged to give access to the granting authority/Commission/OLAF/EPPO/ECA for the checks,
reviews, audits and investigations set out in Article 25 of the Grant Agreement.
If they refuse such access or otherwise intentionally and without proper justification resist a
check, review, audit or investigation, this constitutes a breach of the Grant Agreement.
The consequences depend on the case. If the refusal means that certain costs or
contributions could not be verified (and are thus insufficiently substantiated), they will be
considered ineligible and rejected (see Article 27). In addition (or if there is no impact on
specific costs or contributions), the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).

General > Article 26 — Impact evaluations
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the objectives and
indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or beneficiaries and will be
considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact of the action,
including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may apply the
measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Impact evaluations
In principle, for 2021-2027, all programmes measure the impact of the actions through the
key performance indicators (KPIs) that are collected as part of the continuous reporting.
The formal evaluation procedure set out in this provision is therefore currently not in active
use by any of the programmes using the General Model Grant Agreement. If needed, the
granting authority will provide guidance directly to the beneficiaries.

CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
General > Article 27 — Rejection of costs/contributions
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at beneficiary termination, interim payment, final payment or afterwards —
reject any costs or contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in particular following checks, reviews,
audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant (see Article 25).
Ineligible costs or contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the coordinator or
beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary
concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the
rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory procedure with pre-
information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions, it will deduct them from the costs or contributions
declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
1. Rejection of costs or contributions
What? If the granting authority finds ineligible costs or contributions (in particular,
following a check, audit, extension of audit findings, review or investigation), it will reject
them (— in full, i.e. for the amount that is ineligible).
Grounds for cost or contribution rejection (by the EU):
▪ Costs or contributions do not comply with the Grant Agreement’s general
eligibility rules, see Article 6.1
▪ Costs or contributions do not comply with the Grant Agreement’s specific
eligibility rules, see Article 6.2
▪ Costs or contributions fall under the categories of ineligible costs or
contributions, see Article 6.3.
Whereas rejection will usually be based on findings of the granting authority under the
respective grant, it may also happen that costs or contributions are rejected based on
extension of audit findings (see Article 25.5) from other grants, if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or similar rules
applicable)
275EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the ineligibility is:
− systemic or recurrent, and
− has a material impact across grants.
When? Rejection of costs or contributions can take place at any moment — at the time of
beneficiary termination, interim payment, payment of the balance or afterwards (e.g.
following ex-post audits).
Cost or contributions must comply with general and specific eligibility conditions and not
fall under the categories of ineligible cost. Any cost or contributions that do not comply with
all of these conditions may be rejected (see Article 6).
2. Procedure
How? The beneficiaries will be informed about the cost rejections and given the opportunity
to submit their observations.
Formally speaking, the procedure is slightly different:
− if rejection leads to a recovery: the procedure is a standard contradictory
procedure
− if rejection does NOT lead to a recovery (just a decreased payment): the procedure is
apayment review procedure.
The difference in the two procedures is in the timing. In case of recoveries, there is nothing
to pay out, so the procedure foresees a standard contradictory procedure. In case of positive
amount to pay, the procedure switches to the payment review procedure in order to allow the
granting authority to immediately pay out undisputed amounts and focus the
observations/review on the disputed amounts.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Payment review procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator about the rejection of costs or
contributions and notifies the amounts that will be paid out (notification of
amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Step 2 — If the beneficiaries disagree, the coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days
to inform the granting authority of its objections.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the request for review and informs the
coordinator of its outcome.
Depending on the moment when costs or contributions are rejected, this procedure will be
directed either at the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
276EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for rejections at the time of an interim payment or the final payment: normally the
coordinator
− for rejections after beneficiary termination and after final payment: normally the
beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries
concerned via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of
delivery, etc) and ask for their comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries.
If it is directed at the beneficiary during the action, the granting authority will inform the
coordinator later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality). Beneficiaries should inform
their coordinator if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action (see Article 19.3).
If it is directed at the beneficiary after the action, beneficiaries do not have to inform their
coordinators or ask them to submit comments.
3. Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions at beneficiary termination, it will
deduct the rejected amount from the costs or contributions that the beneficiary declared in
the termination report and calculate the amount due to the beneficiary. If the amount is
lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary, the
granting authority will recover the difference (see Article 22.3.2).
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions at the moment of an interim
payment or the final payment, it will deduct them and calculate the amount to be paid
accordingly (see Articles 22.3.3 and 22.3.4).
If ineligible costs or contributions are found in-between payments, the granting authority
will reject them at the next payment (i.e. deduct the amount rejected from the amounts
declared in the next financial statement and calculate the amount to be paid accordingly; see
Article 22).
If the granting authority rejects costs after the final payment, it will deduct the amount
rejected from the amounts accepted for the beneficiary at the final payment and calculate a
revised final grant amount for the beneficiary. This may be followed by a recovery if
needed (see Article 22.3.5).
277EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 28 — Grant reduction
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — reduce the grant for
a beneficiary, if:
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including improper
implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics or security rules (if
applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant (see Article 25).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and proportionate to the
seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, by applying an
individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the coordinator
or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the reasons why. The coordinator or
beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — submit observations if it disagrees
with the reduction (payment review procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory procedure with
pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the amount due
(and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
1.Grant reduction
What? If the granting authority finds (e.g. following a check, audit, extension of audit
findings, review or investigation) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of
obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-compliance with the call
conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach of
ethics, values or security rules, etc) under the Grant Agreement or during the award
procedure, it may reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the finding.
Grant reductions will be made in proportion to the seriousness of the error, irregularity,
fraud or breach (e.g. in case of fraud the reduction may be up to a 100%).
If the issues are found before the end of the action, the beneficiaries must take all
possible corrective steps to bring the action implementation back into line with the Grant
Agreement.
1. The monthly declaration of days worked in the project correctly signed (see Article
20) OR reliable time records will normally be sufficient proof of the assignment to 278
the action — unless there is other contradicting evidence (e.g. the employment
contract indicates that the person was hired to work on another project).EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Grounds for grant reduction:
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may make a grant reduction if a beneficiary has committed
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations — either
during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement.
Serious breach of obligations may cover all kinds of non-compliance with Grant
Agreement obligations (including obligations during the award procedure).
Example: False declarations in the proposal form in order to obtain EU funding.
In practice, the most frequent breach is improper implementation of the
action/non-compliance with Annex 1 (i.e. if the work performed does not
correspond to the activities described in Annex1). This will normally be examined
on the basis of the periodic and final technical reports and, if needed, a project
review.
Breaches of other obligations, such as the obligation to respect and commit to EU
values (see Article 14), may also lead to grant reductions.
Example: A non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless of religious
or political background released very controversial statements of xenophobic nature, in
particular by calling to destroy country X. One of the activities which was supposed to be
implemented by the entity was cancelled by the subcontractor because of these
statements. In the specific context of the action in question , these statements were
considered a breach of the obligation to respect EU values (non-discrimination). This
conduct led to a reduction of the grant amount (among other measures).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also make a grant reduction, if such substantial errors,
irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants,
if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
When? Grant reductions will be made at beneficiary termination, at the end of the action or
after the payment of the balance.
2. Procedure
How? The beneficiaries will be informed about the grant reductions and given the
opportunity to submit their observations.
Formally speaking, the procedure is slightly different:
− if reduction leads to a recovery: the procedure is a standard contradictory
procedure
− if reduction does NOT lead to a recovery (just a decreased payment): the procedure is
apayment review procedure.
279EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The difference in the two procedures is in the timing. In case of recoveries, there is nothing
to pay out, so the procedure foresees a standard contradictory procedure. In case of positive
amount to pay, the procedure switches to the payment review procedure in order to allow the
granting authority to immediately pay out undisputed amounts and focus the
observations/review on the reduction.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Payment review procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator about the reduction and notifies
the amounts that will be paid out (notification of amounts due; see Article
22.3).
Step 2 — If the beneficiaries disagree, the coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days
to inform the granting authority of its objections.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the request for review and informs the
coordinator of its outcome.
Depending on the moment when reduction takes place, this procedure will be directed either
at the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
− for reductions at the time of the final payment: normally the coordinator
− for reductions after beneficiary termination and after final payment: normally the
beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries
concerned via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of
delivery, etc.) and ask for their comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries.
If it is directed at the beneficiary during the action, the granting authority will inform the
coordinator later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality). Beneficiaries should inform their
coordinator if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action (see Article 19.3).
If it is directed at the beneficiary after the action, beneficiaries do not have to inform their
coordinators or ask them to submit comments.
3. Effects
If the granting authority makes a reduction at beneficiary termination, it will deduct the
reduction from the accepted EU contribution based on the costs or contributions that the
beneficiary declared in the termination report and calculate the amount due to the
beneficiary. If the amount is lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by
the beneficiary, the granting authority will recover the difference (see Article 22.3.2).
If the granting authority makes a reduction at the final payment, it will deduct them and
calculate the amount to be paid accordingly (see Article 22.3.4).
If the granting authority makes a reduction after the final payment, it will deduct the
amount reduced from the accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary at the final payment
280EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
and calculate a revised final grant amount. This may be followed by a recovery if needed
(see Article 22.3.5).

SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
General > Article 29 — Payment deadline suspension
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment cannot be
processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or additional
information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing audit extension procedure, queries about
eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations
are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — and
the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to confirm if the
suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the revised report is
not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority may also terminate the grant or
the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. Suspension of the payment deadline (by the EU)
What? The granting authority must make its payments in accordance with the timeline set
out in the Data Sheet (usually 30 days from grant signature/start of project for initial
prefinancing and 60 or 90 days from reception of the additional pre-financing/periodic report.
If the deadline is missed, late payment interest will be due by the granting authority (see
below and Article 22.5) — unless the payment deadline has been suspended.
Suspension of the payment deadline must be distinguished from suspension of
payments (see Article 30). Suspension of the payment deadline is an ad hoc measure
regarding a pending payment. Suspension of payments is independent of any individual
payment request as a measure to stop making payments to a beneficiary which is, for
example, suspected of serious misconducts.
The payment deadline may be suspended temporarily on the grounds listed in this Article.
Grounds for suspension of the payment deadline (by the EU):
282EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Payment request is incomplete or requires clarification.
The granting authority may suspend the payment deadline, if the reports (or any
of their documents) are incomplete or unclear and the granting authority is
therefore not in a position to determine that the action has been properly
implemented and the payment is due.
Examples: the reports, the certificate on the financial statement or other supporting
documents are missing; the information in the periodic technical report is incomplete;
additional information on the coordinator’s new bank account is needed
▪ Doubts on the amount to be paid in the financial statements that require
additional verifications.
The granting authority may suspend the payment deadline, if it has doubts (e.g.
due to conflicting information between documents, or audit findings in other grants
on the eligibility of the costs in the financial statements) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are needed to establish the amount to be paid.
Example: The costs claimed in the financial statements are not consistent with the action
tasks described in the technical report.
▪ There are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
The granting authority may also suspend the payment deadline, if it has other
doubts on the eligibility of payment claims. It will request the necessary
information or enact other measures including by means of on-the-spot-checks if
necessary.
Example: The granting authority has received information that parts of the activities are
not properly implemented and subject to fraud.
2. Procedure
How? The granting authority will inform the coordinator of the suspension of the payment
deadline and explain the reasons why.
There is NO contradictory procedure for the suspension itself. However, if the suspension
exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the granting authority if the suspension is to
be continued (i.e. ask to confirm it or lift it). In addition, a contradictory procedure/payment
review will be available later on if the granting authority should eventually decide to dispute
amounts and make rejections/grant reductions).
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the day the notification (announcing payment deadline suspension) is
sent to the coordinator (and ends on the day it is lifted).
As soon as the suspension is started, passing days do no longer count towards the 60 or 90
day deadline set out in the DataSheet and accordingly no late-payment interest for the
beneficiaries will accrue. With the lifting of the suspension, the remaining payment period
starts to run again (as from the day-count on which the suspension started).
If the issues have been resolved satisfactorily (e.g. the coordinator sent the requested
information or re-submitted the report) or the granting authority has finished the necessary
verifications (e.g. an audit), it will lift the suspension and inform the coordinator.
If a deadline has been suspended for several reasons, it will be lifted only when the
consortium has satisfactorily addressed ALL the reasons.

General > Article 30 — Payment suspension
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for one or more
beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is suspected of having
committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including improper
implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics or security rules (if
applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant.
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make partial payment(s)
for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the payment (or recovery) of the
remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary
concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally
notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting authority will
formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the suspension end date.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For interim payments,
the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article 21) must not contain any
financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated entities). The coordinator must include
them in the next periodic report after the suspension is lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of
the action — in the last periodic report.
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. Suspension of payments (by the EU)
284EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What? The granting authority may suspend pre-financing, interim and final payments (for
one or more beneficiaries), on the grounds listed in this Article.
Suspension of payments has NO impact on the action implementation. The beneficiary
concerned must continue to work on the action, while addressing the issues that have led to
suspension of the payment; costs incurred during suspension of payments are in principle
eligible, but there will be no payments.
Grounds for suspension of payments (by the EU):
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may suspend payments, if a beneficiary has committed or is
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious
breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-
compliance with the call conditions, submission of false information, failure to
provide required information, breach of ethics, values or security rules, etc) —
either during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement.
Example:
1. False declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding
2. Based on information received from a third party, the granting authority suspects that
the beneficiary and the person who has powers of control towards the beneficiary are in
breach of EU values. The information received indicates that public statements which are
discriminatory and incite hate towards women have been made by the person who controls
the beneficiary. The granting authority suspended payments to the beneficiary until it
confirmed that the allegations were not supported by reliable evidence.
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also suspend payments, if such substantial errors,
irregularities- or, fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants,
if
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of
obligations are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systemic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other Grant
Agreements signed by the audited beneficiary. The grating authority may suspend all
outstanding payments for the audited beneficiary until the issue is resolved.
2. Procedure
How? Before suspending payments, the granting authority will follow a contradictory
procedure to give the beneficiary the possibility to submit observations.Contradictory
procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the beneficiary concerned of its intention (and
the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
285EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 — The beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An extension
may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the day the notification (confirming suspension) is sent to the
beneficiary concerned (and ends on the day it is lifted).
During suspension, NO individual financial statements may be submitted for the beneficiary
(or beneficiaries) concerned with the periodic reports (except with the report for the final
reporting period).
Costs incurred (for continuing to implement the action during suspension) are eligible and
may be included in the next financial report, after suspension has been lifted. At the latest,
they must be included in the periodic report for the final reporting period (— even if
suspension is still ongoing).
Technical reports submitted during suspension must include the work of the beneficiaries
concerned.
If payments for one (or some) of the beneficiaries are still suspended at the end of the
action, the granting authority will make a partial payment of the balance for the amount that
is not suspended (— but ONLY after having received all the necessary information for the
final calculations for ALL consortium members, i.e. including the suspended beneficiaries).
The partial final payment that will be paid out in this case is NOT the payment that
closes the action for the purposes of the deadlines set out in Point 6 of the Data Sheet. That
payment will be made only after the payment suspensions are lifted.

ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances — in
particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
− the reasons why
− the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request and
− the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately request another
amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption date (one day after suspension
end date), extend the duration and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see
Article 39) — unless the grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect
from the suspension end date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of
the amendment request.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for activities
implemented during grant suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. GA suspension (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the ground set out in
this Article.
GA suspension may be used exceptionally if it is necessary to stop the action
implementation, to fix specific problems. It should NOT be used in situations that cannot
be resolved through a temporary interruption of the project activities; in these cases, it may
be better to terminate the Grant Agreement (see Article 32).
Ground for GA suspension (by the Consortium):
▪ Action can no longer be implemented (or becomes excessively difficult)
The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), if implementation
becomes impossible or excessively difficult.
Example: A fire devastates a beneficiary’s premises, with most of the technical equipment
and computers used for the action and containing the action results. The beneficiaries
287EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
therefore request that the part of the action that is affected by this is suspended until the
premises are restored.
Information obligation — Depending on the reasons for suspension, the beneficiaries may
also have to take other measures under the Grant Agreement (e.g. inform the granting authority
under Article 19; notify a situation of force majeure under Article 35).
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the date the suspension takes effect (this date may be before the date of the
submission of the amendment request) and the expected date of resumption.
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the date specified in the amendment request.
The beneficiaries must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit the damage and do
their best to resume (i.e. continue) implementing the action as soon as possible.
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are
NOT eligible (see Article 6.3). Costs may again be incurred for the action, once action
implementation is resumed.
If the action can be continued (resumed), the coordinator must notify it to the granting
authority by requesting an amendment to the Grant Agreement.
The resumption amendment must again be requested in accordance with Article 39 (e.g. it
must be signed by the coordinator’s LSIGN).
It sets the resumption date and adapts the grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the
action duration, modifying Annexes 1 and 2, updating the reporting periods).
If the granting authority approves the resumption amendment, the suspension is lifted and
will be resumed as from the resumption date (i.e. one day after the suspension end date set
in the amendment, which can be retroactive, i.e. back to the date when the problem
stopped/issue was clarified).
Example: The action was suspended on 24.03.2023 due to an extreme weather event affecting the
premises of the coordinator and making continuous implementation of the action temporarily
unfeasible. After two months of clearing efforts, the conditions improve and the coordinator’s
premises are accessible again. The coordinator requests an amendment to set the suspension end
date on 22.05.2023. Therefore, the action will be resumed as from 23.05.2023.
If the suspension is lifted and the action resumes, the action’s remaining budget can be used
for action implementation.
If a part of the action cannot be implemented anymore (e.g. due to impossibility following the
circumstances causing the suspension), the granting authority may agree to amend the Grant
Agreement with changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation, including by
decreasing activities and budget unless changes are so significant that they call into question
the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment (see below and
Article 39).
288EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the action or a significant part of it can NOT be continued (or the granting authority does
not approve the amendment; see Article 39), the Grant Agreement (or the participation of
one or more beneficiaries) may be terminated.
In this case, NO further costs (incurred after the date of suspension) can be declared, except
the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1).
Example: The action starts on 01.01.2022 and is to last 36 months. The action’s implementation is
suspended for four months, from the date specified in the amendment request, e.g. 01.12.2022 to
31.03.2023 and the suspension leads to the Grant Agreement termination. The eligible costs are:
− costs incurred from the action’s start (01.01.2022) until the date specified in the
amendment request (30.11.2022)
− costs incurred for the submission of the first periodic report and the final report.

31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is suspected of having
committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including
improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions,
submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach of
ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits
and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant

2 if selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as specified in
Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute, and this impacts the
implementation of the action under this Agreement]]
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: additional GA suspension grounds: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with additional GA suspension grounds: [additional GA suspension grounds:
insert other grounds]].
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally
notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date specified
in the notification).
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority will formally
notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the suspension end date and invite
the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to set the resumption date (one day after
suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new
situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be
lifted with effect from the suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be
before the date on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for activities
implemented during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a beneficiary (see
Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
290EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. GA suspension (by the EU)
What? The granting authority may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the grounds
listed in this Article.
Grounds for GA suspension (by the EU):
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may suspend the action, if a beneficiary (or one of its
person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or one of its
person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious
breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-
compliance with the call conditions, submission of false information, failure to
provide required information, breach of ethics, values or security rules, etc) —
either during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement
Examples:
1. False declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding
2. Based on information received from a third party, the granting authority suspects that
the beneficiary and the person who has powers of control towards the beneficiary are in
breach of EU values. The information received indicates that public statements which are
discriminatory and incite to hate towards women have been made by the person who
controls the beneficiary. The granting authority suspended the Grant Agreement
implementation until it confirmed that the allegations were not supported by reliable
evidence.
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also suspend the action, if a beneficiary (or one of its
person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or one of its
person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations in other
grants, if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systematic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other Grant Agreements
signed by the audited beneficiary. The granting authority may suspend the audited
beneficiary’s part of the action until the issue is resolved.
291EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ If provided in the Grant Agreement: the linked action (see Article 3) has not
started as specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute
and this impacts the implementation of the action under the Grant Agreement.
▪ Depending on the programme and on the type of action, there may be other
specific grounds for suspension of the Grant Agreement by the granting
authority, for example:
− major delays (CEF, RENEWFM, JTM)
− loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost scientific or technological relevance.
Example: A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered
material is selected. After the action starts, a European scientific publication
demonstrates that this material contains a chemical substance that irremediably
harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot continue and the granting
authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
− loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its economic relevance
− loss of relevance as being part of a given portfolio (HE-challenge-
based EIC Pathfinder actions and Missions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially
selected.
− change of humanitarian context no longer allows the
implementation of the action (HUMA)
− suspension or termination of the cooperation or of the Financing
Agreement with the partner country in which the project takes
place (RELEX)
− change of partner country policy environment (RELEX).
Specific cases (GA suspension by the EU):
Loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE) — The granting authority may suspend
the action, if it needs time to assess whether the action has lost scientific or technological
relevance. This may in particular be the case:
− if a complete revision of Annex 1 is necessary to assess the impact of a request for
amendment
− if work has significantly deviated from the original work plan
− if a key beneficiary leaves the action and the consortium needs time to find a
replacement
− after a check, audit or review of the action.
Example: There are technical problems with implementing the work under an action as
described in Annex 1, so the consortium proposes changes to the work to be carried out. This
may jeopardise its technological relevance and the granting authority decides to suspend its
implementation and to carry out a review.
292EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions) — The granting authority may suspend the
action, if the action has lost its economic relevance.
Loss of relevance as being part of a portfolio (HE-challenge-based EIC Pathfinder actions
and Missions) — The granting authority may suspend the action, if the action has lost its
relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially selected.
2. Procedure
How? Before suspending the Grant Agreement, the granting authority will follow a
contradictory procedure to give the consortium the possibility to submit observations.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator of its intention (and the reasons
why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator has 30 days to submit observations. An extension may be
granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
If possible, the granting authority will give an estimation of how long the suspension will be
needed.
3. Effects
The suspension starts the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date
specified in the confirmation notification).
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are
NOT eligible (see Article 6.3). Eligible costs may again be incurred and declared for the
action, once the suspension is lifted.
If the action can be continued, the granting authority will lift the suspension and inform the
coordinator (together with the suspension end date).
The suspension can be lifted retroactively (i.e. back to the date when the problem
stopped/issue was clarified).
The coordinator must then request an amendment to the Grant Agreement (see Article 39),
to set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date) in the tools and adapt the
grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the action duration modifying Annexes 1 and 2,
updating the reporting periods).
If the action (or part of it) can NOT be continued, the Grant Agreement (or a beneficiary’s
participation) may be terminated.
If the suspension leads to the Grant Agreement termination, NO further costs (incurred after
the date of suspension) can be declared, except the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1).
Ineligible costs will be rejected. The grant may be reduced, if the termination is based on
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations (for instance if the
action has not been implemented properly; see Article 28). In certain cases, the granting
authority may also impose administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion and/or financial penalties;
see Article 34).

32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the date of the
submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify termination, it may
consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a periodic report (for
the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of the report
submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented before the
end of work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after the end of work are
not eligible.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and contributions which
are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no costs/contributions if no periodic
report was ever approved).
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and security), 16
(IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and
investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 41 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
1. GA termination (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries have the right to terminate the Grant Agreement.
GA termination should be a last-resort measure, if all efforts to continue the action fail.
If the action implementation just becomes temporarily impossible or excessively difficult, it
may be better not to terminate the grant, but to suspend it (see Article 31). In this case, the
Grant Agreement would only be terminated if it turns out later that implementation cannot be
resumed anymore.
294EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: A fire devastates premises where most of the technical equipment and computers used in
the action are stored. If the beneficiaries consider that the premises can be replaced and the action
will still be correctly implemented, they may suspend implementation and resume it when the new
laboratory is operational. However, if the action has been suspended and it is not possible to find
new premises and therefore it is impossible to resume the action, the beneficiaries may terminate
the Grant Agreement.
Grounds for GA termination (by the Consortium):
▪ Any ground that justifies early termination of the action
The beneficiaries may terminate the Grant Agreement in principle on any ground
— as long as there is a good reason (e.g. circumstances make its implementation
impossible or excessively difficult; loss of the action’s scientific or technological
relevance; force majeure).
Even if there are no legitimate reasons for discontinuing the action, the granting authority
can NOT oppose, but termination will be considered improper.
Improper termination of the Grant Agreement may lead to a grant reduction (see
Article 28).
This will be the case, for instance, if:
− the implementation of the action has become impossible or excessively difficult due to
the beneficiaries’ wilful misconduct or gross negligence
− the reasons provided are based on changes in the strategic choices of the
beneficiaries, not linked to any specific economic or operational difficulties
− implementation would have been possible if the beneficiaries had made more (but still
reasonable) efforts.
Example: The beneficiaries decide to terminate the Grant Agreement due to internal
communication and decision-making problems within the consortium, and notify the granting
authority via the coordinator. The granting authority considers that these internal problems have
jeopardised the action’s implementation, but do not justify terminating the Grant Agreement
because they could have been solved within the consortium on the basis of the consortium
agreement. This improper termination may lead to a grant reduction.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the granting authority beforehand, to discuss
the termination and possible alternatives.
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
− the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request. Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
3. Effects
295EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit the necessary reports (i.e. a periodic
report for the open reporting period until termination).
If the coordinator fails to submit the reports (within the 60 days of the date on which
termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial report
will NOT be taken into account when the final grant amount is calculated. The granting
authority will NOT send a reminder and will NOT extend the deadline.
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and the payment of the balance
(see Article 22).
If the total amount of earlier payments (pre-financing payment and interim payments, if any)
received before termination:
− is greater than the final grant amount, the balance is negative and will take the form
of a recovery (see Article 22.2)
− is lower than the final grant amount, the granting authority will pay the balance (see
Article 22.3.4).
Only costs incurred before the end of work date (i.e. generating event before the end of work
date; see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:
− costs for the reports (see Article 6.1)
Example: The action’s duration is 36 months. The starting date is 01.01.2022. The notified end
of work date is 01.05.2023. Therefore, only costs incurred in connection with the action from
1.1.2022 to 1.5.2023 (16 months) and the costs related to submission of the periodic report for
the last reporting period are eligible
− costs for (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before the end of work date
(see Article 6.1).
Example: One of the beneficiaries of the Grant Agreement has a contract to carry out 8 tests
during the action’s duration. However, only three tests out of 8 are carried out before the end of
work date. Therefore, only the costs related to these 3 tests carried out before the end of work
date may be eligible for the action.
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
Termination has NO effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action.
Obligations that continue to apply after GA termination:
▪ Keeping records and other supporting documentation (see Article 20)
▪ Submitting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination)
(see Articles 32.1.2 and 21.2)
▪ Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (e.g.
for checks, reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact;
see Articles 25 and 26)
▪ Complying with the rules on management of intellectual property, background and
results (see Article 16 and Annex 5 > IPR)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security)
▪ Complying with the security obligations (if applicable) (see Article 13 and Annex 5
> Confidentiality and security)
296EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Promoting the action and giving visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17 and
Annex 5 > Communication, dissemination and visibility)
▪ No assignment of claims for payment (see Article 42)

General > Article 32.2 — Beneficiary termination by consortium
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, on request of
the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the date of the
submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment request must
be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify termination, it
may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until
termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial statement, the
explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on the financial statement
(CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed (e.g.
reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary; addition of a
new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the report submitted
and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented before the end of
work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after the end of work are not
eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next reporting
period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the deadline, it
will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
298EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is amended to
introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into question the
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the grant may be
terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant termination (see Article
32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews,
audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 41 (assignment of
claims)) continue to apply.
1. Partner termination (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of the partners (or several),
if:
− the partner concerned can no longer participate or
− the consortium has decided to change the partner (in accordance with the internal
decision-making procedures). In this case, the consortium must inform the beneficiary
concerned, request the beneficiary’s opinion in writing and provide it to the granting
authority (or — if the beneficiary didn’t reply — provide proof that the beneficiary’s
opinion has been requested in writing).
Grounds for partner termination (by the Consortium):
▪ Any ground that justifies termination of the participation of the beneficiary
The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of their consortium
members in principle on any ground — as long as there is a good reason (e.g.
withdrawal by a beneficiary because due to a change in ownership; the beneficiary
cannot implement its tasks in the same way; bankruptcy).
If there are no legitimate reasons, the granting authority will NOT oppose beneficiary
termination, but it will be considered improper.
Improper termination of the participation of a beneficiary may lead to grant reduction
(see Article 28) or even grant termination (see Article 32.3).
Termination extends to affiliated entities. Affiliated entities cannot participate in the action
without the beneficiary they are linked to, therefore, terminating a beneficiary’s participation
implies that its affiliated entities may NOT continue participating in the action.
Best practice: Partner terminations should always be first discussed within the consortium, to
make sure that everybody agrees. In case of conflicts, they should be resolved in accordance
with the consortium agreement. The granting authority will not get involved in internal
disputes; it is the coordinator’s responsibility to handle partner terminations correctly.
299EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For beneficiaries that are involved in several EU Grant Agreements, withdrawal from one
Grant Agreement does NOT necessarily imply that it has to also withdraw from the others.
Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or the
coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority. Late information will be considered
as a breach of the information obligation under the Grant Agreement (see Article 19.4).
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
− the date the beneficiary ends working on the action (‘end of work date’)
− the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request. Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
3. Responsibility
NO amendment is needed if the termination takes effect after the end of the action (and
before payment of the balance) — unless it concerns the coordinator (since the coordinator
has many obligations also after the end of the action, e.g. submit the reports, receive the
payment of the balance and distribute the payment among the beneficiaries).
If it is rejected, the beneficiaries will have to make another proposal to the granting
authority. If a satisfactory solution cannot be found (i.e. the request for an amendment calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of the equal treatment
of applicants), the Grant Agreement may be terminated.
Example: A key beneficiary terminates its participation in the Grant Agreement. The consortium
cannot find a proper replacement and the granting authority therefore considers that the action
cannot be continued in the way for which it was originally awarded the grant.
If the amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Grant Agreement must also be
amended to introduce the necessary changes (including, if necessary, the replacement with
new beneficiaries).
4. Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit the following:
− a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
− a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate
on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
− a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with the other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary;
addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of
coordinator, etc.).
300EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best practice: If possible, the two amendments should be combined and done
together.
In case of coordinator termination, the reports must be submitted by the new
coordinator (to avoid problems with the payment). If the nomination of the new coordinator
takes more time, the 60 days deadline may be extended.
The information contained in the beneficiary’s termination report must also be included in the
periodic report for the next reporting period.
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the terminated beneficiary:
− if the granting authority owes amounts to the beneficiary, those amounts will be paid
with the following payment to the consortium (interim or final)
− if the beneficiary owes, those amounts must be paid back to the consortium.
Only costs incurred before the end of work date (i.e. generating event before the end of work
date see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:
− costs for the termination report (see Article 6.1)
− costs for (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before the end of work date
(see Article 6.1).
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 60 days of the date on
which termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial
report will NOT be taken into account when the contribution is calculated. The granting
authority will NOT send a written reminder and will not extend the deadline.
If the coordinator fails to submit the report on the distribution of payments, the beneficiary
whose participation was terminated will NOT have to repay any amounts to the consortium.
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the Grant Agreement may be terminated (see Article 32).
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action (see Article 32.2). If the second request for amendment is accepted by the
granting authority, the Grant Agreement is amended to introduce the necessary changes (see
Article 39).
If the Grant Agreement continues (i.e. it is amended), the remaining members of the
consortium (and any new beneficiaries) have the responsibility for fully implementing the
action as described in Annex 1 (see Article 7). They must carry out the action (including the
part that the defaulting beneficiary was supposed to carry out and without any additional
funding to do so).
Specific cases (partner termination by the Consortium):
Termination of the coordinator without its agreement — The decision to terminate the
coordinator must be made by the rest of the consortium (according to its internal decision-
making procedures). The notification and amendment request must be made by one of the
beneficiaries (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries; see Article 39) and the reports must
be submitted by the new coordinator (to avoid problems with the payment). If needed, the
60 days deadline for submission of the reports can be extended (see above).
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — In principle the
coordinator must be changed. If the coordinator can no longer submit the request, the same
301EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
procedure as for coordinator termination without its agreement should be used (see above
and Article 39).

(a) one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 40)
(b) a change to the action or the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation of a
beneficiary is likely to substantially affect the implementation of the action or calls into question the
decision to award the grant (including changes linked to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the
declaration of honour)
(c) following termination of one or more beneficiaries, the necessary changes to the Agreement (and
their impact on the action) would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the

misconduct
(h) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed fraud, corruption, or is involved
in a criminal organisation, money laundering, terrorism-related crimes (including terrorism
financing), child labour or human trafficking
(i) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person

implementation of the action under this Agreement]]
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: additional GA termination grounds: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with additional GA termination grounds: [additional GA termination
grounds: insert other grounds]].
32.3.2 Procedure
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will send a
pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will take effect (confirmation
letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also inform the
coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date specified
in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a periodic
report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of the
report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities
implemented before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination are not eligible.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator may not
submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and contributions
which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no costs/contributions
if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 28) or to
impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority (see Article
33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks,
reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and
41 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
304EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on
the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed (e.g.
reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary;
addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of
coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the report
submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented
before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only
after termination are not eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next
reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is amended to
introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into question the
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the grant
may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality
and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 41 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
1. GA or beneficiary termination (by the EU)
What? The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement or the participation of one
(or more) of the beneficiaries, on the grounds listed in this Article.
Beneficiary termination may lead to GA termination, if the granting authority considers
that following such beneficiary termination, the necessary changes to the Grant Agreement
(and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision awarding the grant or
breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants (see Article 32.3.1(c)).
Grounds for termination (by the EU):
▪ Non-accession to the Grant Agreement
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if one (or more)
beneficiaries did not accede to the Grant Agreement (i.e. did not sign the
305EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Accession Form within 30 days after the entry into force of the Grant Agreement or
did not provide the requested declaration on joint and several liability).
Non-accession of a beneficiary does NOT automatically lead to the Grant
Agreement termination; the consortium can find an alternative solution that
ensures the proper implementation of the action without the beneficiary (and
request an amendment; see Article 39).
In this case, the granting authority will terminate the Grant Agreement only if it
considers the solution inappropriate or if the consortium no longer complies with
the eligibility conditions set out in the call conditions (e.g. the rules
regarding the minimum number of beneficiaries, their legal situation, or their place
of establishment).
▪ Change in a beneficiary’s situation
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if there
has been a change to its (or one of its affiliated entities) legal, financial, technical,
organisational or ownership situation, that is likely to substantially affect or delay
the action’s implementation or calls into question the decision to award the grant.
Such changes can be of any kind and can be triggered by the beneficiary itself or
outside circumstances.
Examples (termination):
1. Beneficiary R moves from Europe to Australia and becomes no longer eligible for
receiving EU funding under the programme. Since participants must comply with the
eligibility conditions throughout the duration of the action, this would be a change that calls
into question the decision to award the grant and the granting authority may decide to
terminate the beneficiary’s participation in the Grant Agreement (or the entire Grant
Agreement if the other beneficiaries fail to find a solution to replace it).
2. An action’s key beneficiary is taken over by a non-European company (not entitled to
participate due to security reasons). This substantially affects the action implementation
and the ownership, protection, exploitation and dissemination of the results. The granting
authority decides to terminate the beneficiary’s participation (or the Grant Agreement as a
whole if the other partners fail to find a replacement).
3. A beneficiary becomes subject to EU restrictive measures (or other public law measures
that prohibit the granting authority from providing funding). This means that the beneficiary
is no longer eligible for funding and the granting authority may decide to terminate its
participation (or the Grant Agreement if no other solution can be found).
4. An SME participating as a beneficiary in a grant is acquired by another company.
Following the change of ownership, the beneficiary exceeds the ceilings of the SME
definition and loses its SME status. As one of the awarding conditions to participate in that
mono-beneficiary grant is to be a single start-up or an SME, the change of status calls into
question the decision to award the grant and the Granting Authority decides to terminate
the Grant Agreement.
Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of change of situation that
entails loss of eligibility, e.g. change of ownership, relocation date, etc (see Article 6).
Loss of eligibility may lead to termination by the EU. However, in most cases, the
granting authority will simply ask the consortium to replace the partner by amendment or to
change the partner’s role to associated partner, etc.
▪ Grant Agreement cannot be amended after termination of a beneficiary’s
participation
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if it cannot be
amended after termination of a beneficiary’s participation because the necessary
306EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
changes to the Grant Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of the equal treatment of applicants; see Article 39).
The Grant Agreement may be directly terminated if beneficiary termination
would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
▪ Action can no longer be implemented
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if action
implementation is prevented by force majeure or the action implementation is
suspended and resumption is not possible or the necessary amendment is not
acceptable (see Articles 31 and 39).
Example:
1. A fire devastates premises where most of the technical equipment and computers with
the action’s data are stored. The coordinator suspends the action’s implementation to
rebuild the premises. The granting authority carries out a review after the force majeure
takes place and concludes that the consortium can no longer implement the action. It
therefore decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
2. A beneficiary that has the necessary background to work on the action and owns the
installations where most of the work would be implemented decides to terminate its
participation. The granting authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement because the
remaining consortium cannot continue implementing the action in the same way without
this beneficiary. Continuing the action in a different way then originally evaluated and
ranked would call into question the decision awarding the grant.
▪ Bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors,
suspension of business activities or other similar proceedings
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it is
declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts,
has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities,
or is subject to any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law
(since this normally implies that the beneficiary cannot carry out the work
properly).
Example: A coordinator informs the granting authority that a beneficiary participating in a
Grant Agreement is insolvent. It does not notify beneficiary termination because it thinks
that the beneficiary may continue implementing the action. The granting authority considers
that the beneficiary has not sufficient means to pursue implementation and terminates the
beneficiary’s participation.
Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or
the coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority. Late information will be
considered as a breach of the information obligation under the Grant Agreement (see
Article 19.4).
▪ Non-compliance with tax or social security obligations
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it has
not fulfilled its obligations to pay social security contributions or taxes under
applicable national law (i.e. the law of the country in which it is established and
those of the country(ies) where the action is implemented; see Article 11.1).
Example: A national administration notifies to the granting authority that a beneficiary did
not pay social security contribution for its employees. If this beneficiary cannot prove that it
paid these contributions or clarify the situation within a given deadline, the granting
authority may terminate its participation in the Grant Agreement. If the beneficiary declared
personnel costs including amounts for social security contributions not actually incurred, the
granting authority may furthermore recover any undue amounts.
▪ Grave professional misconduct
307EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
one of its persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or
one of its persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been
found guilty of grave professional misconduct (proven by any means).
‘Grave professional misconduct’ is defined as any type of unacceptable or improper
behaviour in exercising one’s profession, especially by employees, including grave
professional misconduct within the meaning of Article 138(1)(c) of the EU Financial
Regulation 2024/250947 (see Article 2).
According to Article 138(1)(c) of the Financial Regulation, a person or entity is
guilty of grave professional misconduct when it has violated applicable laws or
regulations or ethical standards of the profession to which the person or entity
belongs, or by having engaged in any wrongful conduct which has an impact on its
professional credibility where such conduct denotes wrongful intent or gross
negligence. Therefore, one of the following conditions needs to exist in order for a
conduct to be qualified as grave professional misconduct:
− the entity has violated applicable laws or regulations or ethical standards of
the profession to which it belongs or
− the entity had a wrongful conduct which has an impact on its professional
credibility and the conduct denotes wrongful intent or gross negligence.
The examples given in Article 138(1)(c) FR cover, in particular, violation of ethical
standards of the profession, wrongful conduct with impact on professional
credibility, breach of generally accepted professional ethical standards, false
declarations/misrepresentation of information, participation in a cartel or other
agreement distorting competition, violation of IPR, attempting to influence
decision-making processes by taking advantage, through misrepresentation, of a
conflict of interests, or to obtain confidential information from public authorities to
gain an advantage and incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence or similar
activities contrary to the EU values where negatively affecting or risking to affect
the performance of a legal commitment.
The concept of 'professional misconduct' covers “all wrongful conduct which has an
impact on the professional credibility of the operator at issue and not only the
violations of professional ethical standards in the strict sense of the profession to
which that operator belongs, which are established by the disciplinary body of that
profession or by a judgment which has the force of res judicata"48.
Examples:
1. A legal entity’s participation in a Grant Agreement is terminated when a national
investigation uncovers that it falsified the results of its clinical studies.
2. A non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless of religious or
political background released controversial statements of anti-Semitic nature, in particular
by calling to destroy country X. Expressing the wish to destroy country X was considered a
conduct which has an impact on the integrity and professional credibility of the organisation
and represents a breach of the generally accepted professional ethical standards and of EU
values. The organisation participation in the Grant Agreement was terminated on the
ground of grave professional misconduct.

308EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
one of its persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or
one of its persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has
committed fraud, corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money
laundering or any other illegal activity.
Example: A legal entity’s participation in several EU projects is terminated when its owner
is convicted by national courts to have participated in large-scale drug trafficking.
▪ Circumvention of fiscal, social or other legal obligations in the country of
origin
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
entities having powers of representation, decision-making or control) was created
under a different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social or other
legal obligations in the country of origin (or one of its persons having powers of
representation, decision-making or control, or one of its persons essential for the
award/implementation of the grant created an entity with this purpose).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement or the participation of
a beneficiary, if a beneficiary (or one of its persons having powers of
representation, decision-making or control, or one of its persons essential for the
award/implementation of the grant) has committed substantial errors,
irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been
properly implemented, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics, values or
security rules, etc) — either during the award procedure or during the action.
Examples:
1. False declarations in the proposal form; coordinator does not transfer payments to the
other beneficiaries, or beneficiaries do not pay their subcontractors; coordinator does not
submit the reports or information (despite a reminder); consortium does not inform the
granting authority about the receipt of a second grant for the same/similar proposal; review
shows that action does not achieve its critical objectives and is way behind schedule and
consortium submits a short-term implementation plan that is not acceptable; audit shows
that beneficiary declared costs based on fake invoices; a check shows that reports
submitted by the consortium were almost entirely copied from the web (plagiarism);
consortium does not submit an amendment request after beneficiary termination
2. A legal entity’s participation in a Grant Agreement is terminated when the granting
authority checks uncovers that the entity made a public speech inciting to hate and
discrimination (breach of obligation to respect EU values in Article 14).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also terminate the Grant Agreement, if a beneficiary
(or one of its person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or one of its person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has
committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of
obligations in other grants, if
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
309EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systematic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that appear intentional and also affect all
other Grant Agreements signed by the audited beneficiary. The granting authority may
terminate the participation of the audited beneficiary in the Grant Agreement.
▪ Non-removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary if it refuses
to remove one of its affiliated entities or an associated partner which is in one of
the following situations:
− bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors,
suspension of business activities or other similar proceedings;
− grave professional misconduct
− non-compliance with tax or social security obligations
− fraud, corruption or other criminal activities
− substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations (in
this grant or other grants).
▪ If provided in the Grant Agreement: the linked action (see Article 3) has not
started as specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can no longer contribute,
and this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement
▪ Depending on the programme and on the type of action, there may be other
specific grounds for termination of the Grant Agreement by the granting
authority, for example:
− major delays (CEF, RENEWFM, JTM)
− loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost scientific or technological relevance.
Example: A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered
material is selected. After the action starts, a European scientific publication
demonstrates that this material contains a chemical substance that irremediably
harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot continue and the granting
authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
− loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its economic relevance
− loss of relevance as being part of a given portfolio (HE-challenge-
based EIC Pathfinder actions and Missions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially
selected.
− change of humanitarian context no longer allows the
implementation of the action (HUMA)
− suspension or termination of the cooperation or of the Financing
Agreement with the partner country in which the project takes
place (RELEX)
− change of partner country policy environment (RELEX).
310EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Before terminating (the Grant Agreement or a beneficiary’s participation), the granting
authority may first suspend the Grant Agreement (see Article 31.2), to try to fix the problems
and re-establish compliance with the Grant Agreement. In this case, it will only terminate
(the Grant Agreement or a beneficiary’s participation) if the action cannot be resumed.
2. Procedure
How? Before GA or beneficiary termination, the granting authority will follow a contradictory
procedure to give the consortium/beneficiary the possibility to submit
observations.Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
Depending on the situation and type of termination, this procedure will be directed either at
the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
− terminations linked to the consortium (e.g. grant termination after a negative project
review): normally the coordinator
− terminations linked to a beneficiary (e.g. beneficiary termination or simultaneous
termination of grants after a beneficiary audit): normally the beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must inform the other beneficiaries, via its
usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc.) and
ask for their comments.
If it is directed at the beneficiary concerned, the granting authority will inform coordinator
later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality).
If a beneficiary is terminated on the basis of Article 32.3.1(e) (i.e. bankruptcy or similar), the
granting authority will also contact the liquidator/administrator (— as soon as possible after
the termination is confirmed).
Information obligation — Beneficiaries should inform their coordinator since beneficiary
termination always has a significant impact on the action (see Article 19), likely requiring a
redistribution of tasks and budget.
3. Effects
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’): Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
The effects of Grant Agreement termination are the same as when the beneficiaries terminate
the Grant Agreement (see Article 32.1.2).
Only costs incurred before termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date;
see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible. Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after
termination are NOT eligible.
Ineligible costs will be rejected. The grant may be reduced, if the termination is based on
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations (for instance if the
action has not been implemented properly; see Article 28). In certain cases, the granting
311EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
authority may also impose administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion and/or financial
penalties; see Article 34).
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action (see Article 32.3.3).
Obligations that continue to apply after GA termination:
▪ Keeping records and other supporting documentation (see Article 20)
▪ Submitting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination)
(see Articles 32.3.3 and 21.2)
▪ Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (e.g.
for checks, reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact;
see Articles 25 and 26)
▪ Complying with the rules on management of intellectual property, background and
results (see Article 16 and Annex 5 > IPR)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security)
▪ Complying with the security obligations (if applicable) (see Article 13 and Annex 5
> Confidentiality and security)
▪ Promoting the action and giving visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17 and
Annex 5 > Communication, dissemination and visibility)
▪ No assignment of claims for payment (see Article 42)

SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND
ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS
General > Article 33 — Liability for damages
ARTICLE 33 — LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to third parties as a
consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross negligence.
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the beneficiaries or other
participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement.
1. Liability for damages (of the EU)
When signing the grant, the beneficiaries agree that the granting authority can NOT be held
liable if — in implementing the Grant Agreement — the granting authority (or its
staff/representatives) cause damage to a beneficiary or third party.
Moreover, the granting authority can NOT be held liable if — in implementing the Grant
Agreement — a beneficiary or third party involved in the action causes damage to another
beneficiary or third party.
Examples:
1. An experiment carried out by a beneficiary leads to an accidental escape of pollutants into the
local river.
2. A fire breaks out in a beneficiary’s laboratory in the course of an experiment for the action
conducted during an audit by the granting authority.
Subsidiary (secondary) liability is also excluded.
The granting authority is also not liable for damages caused by other participants involved in
the action (i.e. affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients of
financial support to third parties (FSTP)).
313EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a result of the
implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full compliance with the
Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.
The liability does not extend to indirect or consequential losses or similar damage (such as loss of profit, loss
of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by wilful act or by a breach of
confidentiality.
1. Liability for damages (of the Consortium)
What? If by implementing the action (or by not implementing the action as agreed) a
beneficiary causes damage to the granting authority, intentionally or as a result of gross
negligence, the granting authority may claim compensation.
Examples:
1. Costs of legal proceedings borne by the granting authority.
2. At a meeting on the granting authority’s premises, a beneficiary smokes and causes a fire.
2. Procedure
How? For liability cases, the granting authority will follow the normal procedure for damages
claims (i.e. bringing an action for contractual damages before the EU courts (General Court)).

General > Article 34 — Administrative sanctions and other measures
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as preventing the adoption of administrative sanctions (i.e.
exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public law measures, in addition or
as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to
148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 2988/9546).
46 Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests
(OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1).
1. Administrative sanctions
What? In the framework of the EU Early Detection and Exclusion System (EDES), the
Financial Regulation 2024/2509provides that the competent EU services can take the
following measures:
− exclusion from participation in award procedures and from being selected for
implementing Union funds, when the beneficiary (or a natural or legal person who is a
member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the beneficiary, a
natural person who is essential for the award or for the implementation of the Grant
Agreement, a natural or legal person that assumes unlimited liability for the debts of
the beneficiary) is in one or more of the exclusion situations mentioned in Article 138
of the Financial Regulation49 (e.g. grave professional misconduct, breach of
obligations, fraud, corruption, irregularity, bankruptcy, etc)
− financial penalties, in the cases described in Article 142 of the Financial Regulation50
(e.g. grave professional misconduct, breach of obligations, fraud, irregularity)
− in order to reinforce the deterrent effect of the above measures, publication of the
information related to the case on the Europa website.
These measures are public law measures (not based on the Grant Agreement) and are
conditional on established facts and findings that are substantiated by reliable evidence (e.g.
OLAF reports; EPPO’s investigations; checks, audit or controls of EU services etc).
When there is only a suspicion of risk threatening the EU financial interests and the relevant
facts are not yet established, the case may be registered in the database for information, to
enable further verifications and reinforced monitoring.
Example: The representative of a non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless
of religious or political background released controversial statements of anti-Semitic nature, in
particular by calling to destroy country X. Expressing the wish to destroy country X is considered a
breach of EU values (non-discrimination) and a grave professional misconduct (a conduct which has
an impact on the integrity and professional credibility of the organisation and represents a breach of
the generally accepted professional ethical standards). The organisation was excluded for a specific
duration from participation in award procedures covered by the general budget of the Union.

315EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Procedure
How? Before taking any of the administrative measures above, the competent EU service will
normally follow a contradictory procedure with the person or entity concerned to give them
the possibility to submit observations (— except if it is necessary to preserve the
confidentiality of an investigation or of national judicial proceedings).
316EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
General > Article 35 — Force majeure
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot be considered
in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement,
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control,
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants involved in the
action), and
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without delay, stating
the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force majeure and do
their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.
1. Force majeure
What? In case of force majeure, the parties will be excused from not fulfilling their
obligations (i.e. there will be no breach of obligations under the Grant Agreement and none of
the adverse measures for breach of contract will be applied).
‘Force majeure’ relates to an extraordinary event or situation that is beyond the party’s
control and that prevents it from fulfilling its obligations under the Grant Agreement.
The event or situation must be inevitable (despite the beneficiary’s due diligence, i.e. level of
care that can reasonably be expected from a beneficiary, in order to ensure the fulfilment of
its obligations under the Grant Agreement) and unforeseeable. Force majeure can NOT be
used to justify situations caused by a beneficiary’s negligence, events that could reasonably
have been anticipated or events that are inherent to the normal activity of the beneficiary
(e.g. sick leaves, strikes, technical failure, human errors, etc.).
Examples (force majeure): An earthquake, terrorist attack or volcanic eruption; delay in using
equipment due to floods in the region/country.
Examples (not force majeure): machine malfunctions, robberies; a subcontractor building a test
site goes bankrupt, labour disputes or strikes, financial difficulties, personnel issues, for example
sickness
Usually, force majeure can be evoked ONLY for the immediate impact of the situation. Once
earthquakes, extreme weather events, etc. have taken place and impact on the further
implementation of the action becomes foreseeable, the beneficiaries must adapt their planning,
take mitigation measures and take all other necessary steps to fulfil their obligations under the
Grant Agreement under the new circumstances.
317EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If force majeure entails extra costs for the implementation of the action they may be eligible
but it will normally be the beneficiaries that will have to bear them (since they were not
budgeted in the proposal and the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 cannot be increased).
If a task for the action could not be executed due to a situation of force majeure but certain
costs were incurred for that task and could not have been avoided, those costs may still be
eligible and can be charged to the action.
Example: Airline tickets bought by a beneficiary to attend a meeting related to the action. The
flight is cancelled because the air traffic is suspended due a terrorist threat, and so the beneficiary
cannot travel to the meeting. If the ticket costs fulfil the eligibility conditions set out under Article 6
of the Grant Agreement and it is impossible for the beneficiary to get those costs reimbursed (e.g
by the airline or a travel insurance) then they may be eligible, even if the beneficiary did not travel.
Force majeure may lead to Grant Agreement suspension (see Article 31) or Grant Agreement
termination (see Article 32).
How? The coordinator must immediately formally notify the granting authority (through
Portal Formal Notifications: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification).
The beneficiary concerned must quickly put in place all possible measures to limit the
damage caused by the force majeure, including measures to limit related costs.

CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
General > Article 36 — Communication between the parties
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
[OPTION 1 for eGrants:
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal in accordance with the Portal Terms and
Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if explicitly instructed otherwise by the
granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the Grant Agreement (project number and
acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and Conditions. For
naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated — before the signature of this
Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’. The role and tasks of the LEAR are
stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of sending, as
indicated by the time logs.
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the communication
is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not been accessed within 10 days
after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general principles apply
(i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with proof of delivery will be considered
to have been received either on the delivery date registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection
at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be considered in
breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Adresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is the official
mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.]
[OPTION 2 for paper grants: For grants which are not managed through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(see Data Sheet, Point 1), the specific rules set out in Annex 5 apply.]
1. Communication between the parties — Funding & Tenders Portal electronic
exchange system
319EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
All communications (information, requests, submissions, ‘formal notifications’, etc) between
the consortium and the granting authority — before and after the payment of the balance —
must be in electronic form and done directly inside the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The Funding & Tenders Portal is the European Commission platform for the single electronic
data exchange area for participants (SEDIA) under Article 150(1) of the EU Financial
Regulation 2024/250951.
The Portal offers different functions:
− viewing and changing the legal entity data in the Participant Register
− formal notifications and other actions inside the different grant management
workflows (amendments, reporting, deliverables, etc)
− contacting granting authority outside a workflow (either through the Portal Formal
Notifications Service or Messaging Service)
− where necessary, secured electronic signatures (for instance, for signing the Grant
Agreement, accession to the Grant Agreement, amendments and financial
statements).
It keeps logs of all communication and allows for delivery with proof of receipt.
All communications are recorded in the project file (with date and time). For communications
that trigger deadlines, also the date and time of access are recorded.
The use of Portal secured personalised area (‘My Area’, also called ‘electronic exchange
system’ or ‘Portal Grant Management System’) is subject to the Funding & Tenders Portal
Terms & Conditions.
Access is limited to persons with a user account and authorisation to act for the beneficiary.
For that purpose, all beneficiaries must have appointed a legal entity appointed
representative (LEAR) before signature of the Grant Agreement. Authorisation and access are
linked to user roles (e.g. LEAR, PLSIGN or PFSIGN).
Examples:
1. Only Legal Signatories (PLSIGNs) may sign the Grant Agreement and amendments.
2. Only Financial Statement Signatories (PFSIGNs) may sign the financial statements.
3. Only Primary Coordinator Contacts (PCoCos) and Coordinator Contacts (CoCo) may submit
information to the granting authority. The Primary Coordinator Contact can be changed only by the
responsible (project) officer in the back-office, while the other roles can be managed by the
participants themselves via the Portal. (In case of MSCA-IF the Supervisor identified in the proposal
becomes the PCoCo, in ERC grants the PI identified in the proposal becomes the PCoCo.)
4. Only Participant Contacts (PaCos) may submit information to the coordinator. They cannot
submit information directly to the granting authority.
5. Only the Participant Contact(s) (PaCo, or PCoCo and CoCo(s) in case of the coordinator), Legal
Signatory (PLSIGN) or Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) of the recipient beneficiary may access a
formal notification for the first time (i.e. may formally receive it).
6. Task Managers (TaMa) may only complete and save web forms and upload documents related to
their organisation’s participation in the grant. They cannot submit information to the coordinator or
the granting authority.
7. Team Members (TeMe) have read-only access to project information. They cannot complete or
save forms, nor submit information to the coordinator or the granting authority.
51 [old Financial Regulation: Article 147(1) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
320EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
More details on My Area and access and roles in the Portal are explained in the Online
Manual > My Area.
In principle, all communications from/to the granting authority must normally go via the
coordinator — unless the Grant Agreement or other rules provide for direct communication
with the other beneficiaries (e.g. Articles 21, 25, 26, 39; OLAF Regulations No 883/2013 and
No 2185/2996).
By using the Portal, the communications will automatically fulfil the minimum conditions
set out in the Grant Agreement (i.e. that they must be made in writing and bear the number
of the Grant Agreement (project number and acronym), in order to be on record and
identifiable).
For actions that require a document upload, you should always use the forms and
templates provided on the Portal Reference Documents — unless explicitly instructed
otherwise by the granting authority.
Beneficiaries may receive notifications even after the end of the project (e.g. for audits,
impact evaluations, etc). Therefore they (and in particular their LEARs) are obliged to keep
the contact data up to date, in order to ensure that the communication channels remain
active.
The responsibility for opening notifications in time is with the beneficiaries.
Formal notifications are considered to have been accessed 10 days after they have
been sent (— even if not actually opened by the recipient, e.g. refusal of reception or
omission). Deadlines that are counted from the date of receipt are counted as of day eleven
(see Article 3.3.3 Funding & Tenders Portal Terms & Conditions).
The same is in principle valid for formal notifications after the payment of the balance —
except that the granting authority will check that the notification has actually been
accessed by the beneficiary (at any time, before or after the 10 days deadline). If it was
not accessed, the granting authority will send a second notification, this time on paper by
registered post with proof of delivery. In that case, the deadlines will start to run from the
date of receipt of the second notification.
Specific cases (Portal access rights):
Beneficiaries in bankruptcy — If a beneficiary goes bankrupt during the action, the
liquidator may be granted the necessary access rights in the Portal, in order to complete the
beneficiary’s obligations. If exceptionally necessary, the granting authority can also agree to
communication outside the Portal electronic exchange system (i.e. via registered post or e-
mails).
2. Date of communication
Communications are considered to have been sent on the date and time they are sent
through the electronic exchange system.
Communications are considered to have been received on the date and time they were
accessed. If formal notifications have not been accessed within 10 days after sending, they
will be considered to have been accessed.
Formal communications made on paper, sent by registered post with proof of delivery, are
considered to have been made on either:
− the delivery date registered by the postal service or
− the deadline for collection at the post office.
321EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The sending party cannot be considered in breach of its obligation to comply with a deadline
in case it can demonstrate that the electronic exchange system was unavailable.
3. Addresses
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
If exceptionally, the communication is on paper, the addresses are as follows:
− for communicating to the granting authority: the official mailing address indicated on
its website (or as otherwise indicated in the call)
− for communicating to beneficiaries: the legal address specified in the Portal Participant
Register.

(OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
1. Periods in days
A period expressed in days starts on the day following the triggering event and ends at
midnight of the last day of the period.
Days are calendar days (not working days).
Example:
Under Article 21.2 and in accordance with the schedule set out in Point 4.2 of the Data Sheet, the
coordinator (or beneficiaries in mono-beneficiaries grants) must submit a periodic report within 60
days following the end of each reporting period.
The action is divided into the following reporting periods:
RP1: from 1 March 2022 to 31 August 2023
RP2: from 1 September 2023 to 28 February 2024
Therefore, the deadline of 60 days for the first periodic report starts on 1 September 2023 and ends
on 30 October 2023.
The deadline of 60 days for the second and last periodic report starts on 1 March 2024 and ends on
29 of April 2024.
2. Periods in months or years
Periods expressed in months or years end at midnight on the day with the same date as the
day on which the period started, in the last month or year of the period.
Example: Under Article 29, the granting authority may suspend the payment deadline if a request
for payment cannot be processed. The suspension takes effect on the day the granting authority
sends the notification. When the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the
granting authority to confirm if the suspension will continue. The granting authority sent the
notification for a grant payment deadline on 31 July 2023. Therefore, the suspension will have
exceeded two months on 30 September 2023.
If that day does not exist (e.g. 31 of April), the period ends at midnight of the last day of that
month (e.g. 30 of April).
Example: Under Article 25.1.2 and in accordance with the time-limit set out in Point 6 of the Data
Sheet, reviews may be started up to two years after the final payment is made. A grant’s final
payment takes place on 29 February 2023. Therefore, the two-year review period starts on 1 March
2023 and ends on 1 March 2025.

General > Article 39 — Amendments
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would call
into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in the Portal
Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries (see Annex 3). If
a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission must be done by another
beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or proof that this
opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45 days of receiving
notification (or any additional information the granting authority has requested). If it does not agree, it must
formally notify its disagreement within the same deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for
the assessment of the request. If no notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to
have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the amendment.
1. Amendments
What & When? Amendments serve to change the Grant Agreement by mutual consent of
the parties.
They are normally done at the initiative of the consortium, but they may also be initiated by
the granting authority (e.g. where errors need to be corrected; to change Annex 1 after a
review of the action, etc).
They are mandatory for all substantive or important changes to the Grant Agreement, e.g.
changes impacting the project outcome, changes that affect the description of the action in
Annex 1, etc.
325EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The general terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement that apply to all EU grants
can NOT be changed via an amendment. Only project-specific data (e.g. duration of the
reporting periods, starting date, etc.) and the options in the Grant Agreement are open to
amendments.
Moreover, amendments may NOT result in changes that — if they had been known before
awarding the grant — would have had an impact on the award decision. Those are mostly
changes that:
− involve the consortium composition and have an impact on the eligibility criteria set
out in the call conditions (e.g. minimum number or types of participants in a proposal)
− involve changes to the action and/or its budget and affect the award criteria
announced in the call conditions (e.g. the tasks in Annex 1 are changed so
substantially that the action no longer corresponds to the scope of the call for
proposals)
− breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
− do not comply with the applicable rules (e.g. Financial Regulation 2024/2509) or with
provisions of the Grant Agreement itself (e.g. amendment to subcontract tasks of the
coordinator).
Characteristics of amendments:
▪ Can only be done in writing — a verbal agreement is not binding on the parties
since EU granting authorities are bound to written format52.
▪ Enters into force after the signature by the coordinator and the granting authority
through an exchange of signatures.
▪ Takes effect on the date agreed by the parties (retroactive or in the future); if no
date is specified, on the date when the second party approves it (not retroactive).
▪ Are usually available only during the action (i.e. after the entry into force of the
Grant Agreement and before the final payment).
▪ Must normally be requested before the end of the project; in exceptional cases
amendment clauses are also open after the end of the project (e.g. change of
coordinator or change of coordinator’s bank account, in order to be able to make
the final payment).
▪ Has to be signed by persons having the same capacity to represent the legal entity
as those who signed the initial Grant Agreement.
▪ Leaves all the other provisions of the Grant Agreement which are not affected
unchanged and with continued full effect.
▪ Forms an integral part of the Grant Agreement.
▪ Has to be in line with the rules applicable to the Grant Agreement (including
applicable EU, international and national law, where relevant under the
Agreement).
52 See Article 204(1) Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 201(1) Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
326EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Cannot have the purpose or effect of making changes to the Grant Agreement
which might call into question the decision awarding the grant or result in unequal
treatment of beneficiaries or applicants.
From a strictly legal perspective, amendments are necessary whenever there is a need to
change the Grant Agreement (including changes to its Annexes).
The amendment clauses that are available in the Portal Amendment tool are called ‘AT
clauses’.
Example: If an affiliated entity ends its participation, the option in Article 8 and the Data Sheet
must be updated to set its ‘termination date’. This can be done by using amendment clause AT6.
If such changes affect the implementation of the action and require an amendment, the
granting authority will examine the situation and inform the coordinator.
Examples (change that requires an amendment):
1. Beneficiary A becomes bankrupt. It will be necessary terminate its participation and to amend
the Grant Agreement.
2. Beneficiary B moves from Europe to Australia during the action. The change of address implies
that the beneficiary becomes ineligible for funding, so the Grant Agreement will have to be
amended to terminate participation or change role to associated partner.
Example (change that does NOT require an amendment): Beneficiary D changes its name.
The update in the Portal Participant Register is sufficient; no amendment is needed.
Information obligation — Changes in the name, address, legal form and organisation type
AND changes in the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation may or may
not require an amendment (see below) — but they ALL trigger the information obligation under
Article 19.3.
Changes without any impact on the Grant Agreement normally do NOT necessarily require a
formal amendment. They are therefore sometimes done by information procedure,
sometimes by formal amendment (if simpler because an automated clause is available).
Sample list (non-exhaustive) of cases where an amendment is necessary:
▪ Addition of a new beneficiary (AT1; see Article 40.2)
What? Addition of a new beneficiary during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The new beneficiary must first register (and get validated) in the Portal Participant
Register — unless it already has a validated participant identification code (PIC).
The beneficiary’s name (and their entry date) will be updated in the Preamble and the
list of participants in the Data Sheet and the beneficiary will be entitled to submit costs
as from that date.
For the entry date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the date of signature of the Accession Form OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment.
Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the
entry date (of the new beneficiary) may be set before the termination date (of the
beneficiary that is replaced) — so that both can incur costs for a certain period.
Example: The former beneficiary ends its participation on 01.06.2021, and the new beneficiary
accedes to the Grant Agreement on 01.05.2021.
Combinations
327EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
If the new beneficiary is participating with affiliated entities/associated partners, they
will also have to be added (with effect from the same date) (AT2, AT3).
For international organisations a change of the applicable law/dispute settlement
options may be needed (AT16, AT17).
▪ Addition of an affiliated entity/associated partner (AT2, AT3; see Article 8 and
9.1)
What? Addition of a new affiliated entity/associated partner during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The new affiliated entity/associated partner must first register (and, for affiliated
entities, also get validated) in the Portal Participant Register — unless it already has a
participant identification code (PIC).
The affiliated entity/associated partner name (and their entry date) will be updated in
the list of participants in the Data Sheet and Article 8/9.1.
For the entry date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date OR the accession date
of the beneficiary OR the date of entry into force of the amendment.
If the affiliated entity/associated partner joins the action at the same time as the
beneficiary they are linked to, the starting date of participation must be the same as the
date of the new beneficiary.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
▪ Beneficiary termination (AT4; see Article 32.2)
What? Removal of a beneficiary during the action.
There is NO need to request an amendment if termination takes effect after the end of
the action (see Article 4) — unless the beneficiary concerned is the coordinator AND the
amendment is necessary for submitting the reports and distributing the payments.
There is NO more need for a separate termination notification (simplification; new for
2021-2027).
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The beneficiary’s name (and their exit and termination dates) will be updated in the
Preamble and the list of participants in the Data Sheet. The beneficiary will be entitled
to submit costs until that date.
For the exit date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the day after submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force
of the amendment.
The exit date should be the date the participant stops (or stopped) working on the
action (i.e. end of cost eligibility date).
328EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For the termination date, the choice is between a fixed date (future) after the
submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment, whichever is the latest. It is normally predefined by the exit date and
automatically fixed by the IT system.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
If the beneficiary was participating with affiliated entities/associated partners, they will
also have to be removed (with effect from the same date) (AT6, AT7).
If the coordinator is removed, the amendment will also have to propose a new
coordinator and coordinator bank account (AT11, AT12).
▪ Removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner (AT6, AT7; see Article 8 and
9.1)
What? Removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
If requested by the granting authority (e.g. because of audit results or an OLAF
investigation), the consortium MUST submit an amendment to remove an affiliated
entity/associated partner. If the consortium does not follow-up this request, the
beneficiary can be terminated by the granting authority (which will also remove the
affiliated entity/associated partner).
The name of the affiliated entity/associated partner (and their exit and termination
dates) will be updated in the list of participants in the Data Sheet and Article 8/9.1.
For the exit date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the day after submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force
of the amendment.
For the termination date, the choice is between a fixed date (future) after the
submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment, whichever is the latest. It is normally predefined by the exit date and
automatically fixed by the IT system.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
▪ Change of coordinator (AT11)
What? Replacement of the coordinator during the action (e.g. because of financial
difficulties).
This amendment clause usually remains open even after the end of the action — until
the final payment is paid out.
What not? There is NO need to request an amendment if there is only a change in the
person in charge of the coordination of the project (since the person’s name is not
mentioned in the Grant Agreement).
Information obligation — In this case you should however inform the granting
authority (see Article 19).
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
329EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The new coordinator becomes beneficiary No 1 in the Preamble and list of participants
in the Data Sheet and the handover date is added to the coordinator list in the Data
Sheet.
For the handover date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or
future) OR the date of entry into force of the amendment.
The handover date should be the date when the new coordinator takes over (and the
former coordinator stops acting as coordinator).
If there was a gap (former coordinator leaves before new coordinator starts; e.g.
coordinator is in bankruptcy) this will be visible in the coordinator list, since the handover
date for the former coordinator (when it stopped doing coordinator tasks) must be at the
latest its termination date.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
The coordinator bank account will have to be changed (AT12).
If the new coordinator is not already a beneficiary of the Grant Agreement, it must
first accede to the Grant Agreement as a new beneficiary (AT1).
If the former coordinator would like to leave, its participation will have to be
terminated (AT4).
▪ Change of the coordinator’s bank account for payments (AT12)
What? An amendment is necessary for all events that imply a change of the account
number/IBAN code indicated in the Grant Agreement (see Data Sheet, Point 4).
What not? NO amendment is necessary for a change of the name of the bank or name
of the account holder; a change of the bank account data (and validation) in the Portal
Participant Register is sufficient.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The bank account data must first be updated in the Portal Participant Register (and be
validated).
▪ Changes to Annex 1 (description of the action) (AT21)
What? Changes to the description of the action, in particular:
− significant change of the action tasks (e.g. if tasks are added/removed) or of
their division among the beneficiaries
Significant changes to the action such as removal of action tasks may put into
question the decision to award the grant. The granting authority will assess on a
case-by-case basis whether such changes are permissible.
− changes concerning eligible in-kind contributions provided by third parties free
of charge (HE) or subcontracts
Such changes could in principle also be made via simplified approval procedure
(see Articles 9.2 and 9.3); however, if the beneficiary requests an amendment,
it will immediately know if the granting authority agrees (or not). Without
amendment, this decision is left for later and the granting authority may reject
the costs as ineligible at the moment of the payment.
330EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− changes concerning the tasks to be carried out by affiliated entities and related
costs (including if an affiliated entity is removed)
− changes concerning Grant Agreement options (options are removed or added)
− significant changes concerning deliverables (e.g. adding/removing deliverables;
changes in substance of a project output which is reflected in a deliverable,
etc.).
What not? Changes to the due date of a deliverable normally do not require an
amendment.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Combinations
Annex 2 may have to be changed (AT41).
▪ Change of the starting date, project duration or reporting periods (AT24,
AT25, AT26)
What? Change of the action’s schedule (starting date, action duration or reporting
periods).
Example: The Grant Agreement for the action has a fixed starting date that is before the
date on which the Grant Agreement enters into force. Because of weather conditions, the
consortium cannot start on that date and requests the granting authority to change it.
Even if the action is prolonged, the maximum grant amount will NOT be increased.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Extensions should be requested before the action ends and must be specifically
justified.
Combinations
Annex 1 may have to be changed (AT21).
Depending on the case all three clauses may have to be used (AT24, AT25 and AT26).
▪ Changes to Annex 2 (estimated budget) and Annex 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, if
necessary (AT41, AT51, AT51a, 51b, 51c, 51d)
What? Changes to the estimated budget, in particular:
− a budget transfer between beneficiaries or between budget categories (or both)
which is linked to a significant change in the action’s work (i.e. Annex 1);
including new subcontracts (for HE, also new eligible in-kind contributions)
− a budget transfer to a form of costs that was not used by the beneficiary (i.e.
with 0 EUR costs in Annex 2) — except for transfer of amounts to budget
categories which are based on unit costs or unit contributions calculated using
the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary (e.g. budget category D.2
Internal invoices)
− a budget transfer to or from the budget category for volunteers (for
programmes with eligible costs for volunteers: ERDF-TA, LIFE, ERASMUS,
CREA, CERV, JUST, ESF/SOCPL, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
− a budget transfer to or from to budget categories based on lump sum costs or
lump sum contributions
331EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What not? There is NO need to request an amendment for changes covered by the
budget flexibility rule in Article 5.5.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Best practice: If Annex 2b or other specific cost annexes need to be changed, the
beneficiaries should contact the granting authority.
Combinations
Annex 1 may have to be changed (AT21).
2. Procedure
How? Amendment requests must be prepared by the requesting party (i.e. usually the
coordinator) directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
Best practice: In case of doubt or if none of the available amendment clauses fit,
beneficiaries should contact the granting authority, to discuss the amendment.
For the addition of new partners, the new entities (beneficiaries, affiliated entities or
associated partners) must have been registered (and beneficiaries and affiliated entities also
validated) in the Participant Register.
Examples:
1. A new beneficiary must be validated (legal entity validation). This means that the new beneficiary will have
to register in the Portal Participant Register, be validated and appoint a LEAR.
2. Validation of the new bank account, to change the bank account.
The request must be unambiguous and complete and submitted in time (i.e. sufficiently in
advance to allow proper analysis and preparation before it is due to take effect and —
generally — before the end of the action; see Article 4). Requests introduced AFTER the end
of the action will be accepted only exceptionally, for very specific and duly substantiated
cases (e.g. change of bank account, change of coordinator to make the final payment).
The coordinator must ensure that they have the agreement of the consortium (in accordance
with the internal decision-making processes, e.g. unanimity, simple or qualified majority, etc
set out in the consortium agreement; where applicable).
Once completed, the request (with all its uploaded supporting documents) must be
submitted and signed by the PLSIGN of the coordinator (on behalf of the other
beneficiaries, on the basis of the mandate given in the accession forms).
Pending amendment requests may at any moment be withdrawn (before they have been
accepted or formally rejected).
Example: The coordinator requests an amendment to change its bank account number and the
reallocation of tasks in Annex 1 and of budget in Annex 2. Since the change of bank account is
urgent because the Commission has to make the interim payment and the revision of the Annexes
may require more time, the coordinator withdraws the request and makes a new request to change
only the bank account and a second one to change the Annexes.
A request containing several changes to the Grant Agreement will be considered as one (and
must either be agreed or rejected by the other party as a whole).
If the receiving party requests additional information/documents, a new deadline will apply,
i.e. 45 days from receiving the additional information/documents.
Example: The coordinator submits a request to add a new beneficiary with several affiliated
entities (see Article 8). The granting authority requests a signed declaration for the joint and
several liability of the affiliated entities (Annex 3a). A new 45-day deadline for evaluation and
validation will apply from the moment the granting authority receives the declaration.
The other party must — within 45 days — agree or disagree.
332EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The deadline may exceptionally be extended by the receiving party, for a period to be
determined case-by-case and if necessary for the assessment of the request (e.g. a review is
needed to assess the changes).
If accepted it will be counter-signed by the receiving party directly in the Portal Amendment
tool (for the consortium: by the PLSIGN of the coordinator).
If there is no reaction within the deadline, the request is in principle considered to have been
rejected (there is NO tacit approval of amendments). A new amendment request may
however be submitted — even if it fully or partly repeats the initial request.
3. Effects
The amendment enters into force and is binding from the moment the receiving party has
agreed to it (i.e. signed in the Portal Amendment tool).
The amendment will take effect (i.e. the changes to the Grant Agreement will start to apply)
either:
− on the day of its entry into force (i.e. day of the last signature of the amendment) or
− on the specific date(s) indicated (and agreed) in the amendment.
The date should normally be after the entry into force of the amendment. In justified cases it
may — exceptionally — be before (retroactivity of the amendment). In some cases, the Grant
Agreement itself provides for retroactivity.
Examples (retroactivity allowed/foreseen in the GA):
1. Where a new beneficiary is added to the Grant Agreement (AT3), it must assume the rights and
obligations from the accession date specified in the Accession Form. If this date is before the entry
into force of the amendment, this retroactivity implies that its costs will be considered eligible as
from the accession date (and not as from the entry into force of the amendment).
2. Following a suspension of the implementation of the action by the beneficiary or by the
Commission, the suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the
amendment (AT26). This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force
(see Article 31.2.2).
3. If the amendment intends to correct an error (AT60), the change will be made with effect from
entry into force of the Grant Agreement (i.e. from the beginning).
Depending on the amendment clause, the date of taking effect may have an impact on the
eligibility of costs.
Amendment request involving several changes, may take effect on different dates.
Example: On 1 May 2022, the coordinator requests an amendment to change the bank account
and to add a new beneficiary. The addition of the beneficiary takes effect from the date of its
accession, as specified in the Accession Form (1 April 2022), while the change of bank account
takes effect on a date agreed by the parties or on the date on which the amendment enters into
force (e.g. 10 June 2022, the day it is signed by the receiving party).
Specific cases (amendments):
Budget transfers — Only the budget transfers that imply a change of Annex 2 (or one of its
Annexes 2a-2e) require an amendment. Other transfers are covered by the budget flexibility
principle and normally do NOT need an amendment (see Article 5.5).
Examples (no need for amendment):
1. During the action implementation, a beneficiary that declared its direct personnel costs as actual
costs decides to change this and instead to declare them as unit costs in accordance with its usual
accounting practices (average personnel costs), which is allowed in its Grant Agreement.
2. An SME joins an on-going GA. The SME owner does not have a salary but incorrectly budgets its
costs as actual personnel costs (category A.1). She realises the mistake and then switches to the
unit costs for SME owners (category A.4); which is allowed in her Grant Agreement.
333EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Change of name, address or other legal entity data (of beneficiaries/affiliated
entities) — Changes to participant legal data normally do NOT require an amendment.
Simple changes of name, legal form (e.g. Ltd., S.A.), official registration number, address,
VAT number do NOT require an amendment. An update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR
(and validation) in the Portal Participant Register is normally sufficient.
If (exceptionally) the granting authority considers that the registered change affects the
implementation of the action, it will inform the coordinator (and instruct them to request an
amendment, if needed).
Example: Company R moves from Europe to Australia and this implies that the beneficiary is no
longer eligible for EU funding. In such a case, the coordinator will be asked to make an amendment
to the Grant Agreement to exchange the beneficiary or to change its role into ‘associated partner’.
Short names have no legal value and only serve as easy identifiers in the Grant Agreement.
If needed, they can be changed through an amendment (AT15).
A change of the person that represents the coordinator for the purposes of signing the Grant
Agreement requires NO follow-up at all (not even a change in the Portal Participant Register
— since the contact information there is only relevant at the moment of Grant Agreement
signature (not afterwards).
Beneficiary termination due to non-accession — The amendment will have ex tunc effect
(as from the beginning of the action and Preamble, list of participants in the Data Sheet and
Article 8 and 9.1 will be adapted to reflect that the beneficiary (and its affiliated
entities/associated partners) had never joined.
Change of roles — Participant changes that involve the switching of roles are now all done
through so-called ‘in/out amendments’ (new for 2021-2027). Meaning that the entity ends its
participation with one role and starts a new participation with another role.
Be aware that there may be timing restrictions which you may have to respect in that
case (e.g. exit date in one role must be before starting date in another role).
In case of loss of eligibility (and if participation is still allowed), partners may be forced to
switch roles (e.g. from beneficiary/affiliated entity to associated partner).
Example: Beneficiary R moves from Europe to Australia and becomes no longer eligible for
receiving EU funding under the programme. Since participants must comply with the eligibility
conditions throughout the duration of the action, the Grant Agreement must be amended to change
the beneficiary or change its role to associated partner. If R is participating with an affiliated entity
M established in France, M will continue being eligible for funding, but would have to change role to
participate as beneficiary.
Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility (see Article
6). That date should therefore be used as exit date.
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — After the end of
the action, if the coordinator can continue its participation with the bank account of the
administrator/liquidator (i.e. termination and coordinator change not really needed), it will be
exceptionally sufficient to just change the bank account for payments (AT12) without
changing the coordinator.
If the coordinator ceased business operations and will not be able to continue participating in
the project, a coordinator change amendment will be needed. If the coordinator is no longer
able to submit the request for amendment (e.g. because the LEAR and all personnel with
access rights in the Portal IT tools left), the same procedure as for coordinator change
without its agreement should be used (see below).
Termination of the coordinator without their agreement — If the consortium
terminates the coordinator without its agreement, it must provide proof of its decision to
334EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
change the coordinator and nominate one of the beneficiaries to act on its behalf to request
the amendment (see Article 32 and below). Contact the EU project officer in charge of your
grant.
Partial takeovers (PTROs) — Partial takeovers (like all other transfers) are now also
handled as normal in/out amendments (there are no more special all-in-one amendment
clauses for transfers). The former participants will therefore have to submit a termination
report and their participation will be formally closed.
In view of the special status of partial takeovers, the accession forms for new beneficiaries
include a clause on joint and several liability for undue amounts paid to the beneficiary they
replace (i.e. recoveries).
Partial takeovers are transfers of a business unit as a going concern (i.e. transfers that go
beyond the simple sale of assets where a part of the business of the beneficiary — including
the Grant Agreement — is taken over by (one or more) other entity(ies), e.g. partial
acquisition, distribution of a business unit after dissolution/liquidation, division/demerger,
etc).
Partial transfers are generally very complex and their effects depend on the specific
circumstances of each case and grant contract and often also on national law.
Depending on whether the initial entity disappears or continues, there are different types of
partial takeovers:
− Partial acquisition — the original entity continues to exist, but a new entity purchases
a department, business unit, or similar (and absorbs or takes over part of the rights
and obligations of the original entity).
Thus, some of the rights and obligations (and contracts) of the original entity are
transferred to the new entity. Since the beneficiary continues to exist as a legal entity
and only some of its rights and obligations are affected, a case-by-case analysis is
needed (and an amendment therefore necessary).
Example: Company X sells its mobile phone division to company Z; all grants where the mobile
phone division of X was involved will be affected by the transfer of rights and obligations; other
grants where other divisions of company X work will not be affected.
− Distribution of a business unit on dissolution/liquidation — the original entity
disappears (due to dissolution or liquidation), but (one or more) new entities purchase
a department, business unit or similar (and absorb or take over part of its rights and
obligations).
Since only some of the beneficiary’s rights and obligations are transferred, a case-by-
case analysis is needed (and an amendment therefore necessary).
− Division/demerger — the original entity disappears and several entities replace it;
different parts of the original entity are transferred to the new entities (i.e. several
partial transfers to different entities).
Examples:
1. Company X has several ongoing grants. Company X is bought by two other companies (Y &
Z), one of which will absorb the mobile phone division and the other the remaining divisions.
For some grants there will be a transfer of rights and obligations from X to Y, for other grants it
will be from X to Z.
2. Company Ω has an ongoing grant (covering some action tasks to be implemented by its
engineering division and some action tasks to be implemented by other divisions). Company Ω
is bought by two other companies (E and O), one of which absorbs the engineering division and
the other the remaining divisions. There are two partial takeovers: one to company E and one
to company O.
335EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the in/out amendment is due to a partial transfer, this should be clearly mentioned in the
amendment request (together with a copy of the takeover contract, a short summary of the
facts, timeline and effects of the takeover under the applicable national law and a list of the
relevant provisions with references and hyperlinks to the texts.
Universal takeovers — Transfers of the Grant Agreement linked to a universal takeover
normally do NOT require an amendment; an update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR (and
validation) in the Portal Participant Register is sufficient.
Universal takeovers are transfers where the original entity is replaced by one new entity and
all the rights and obligations — including the Grant Agreement — are transferred to this new
entity (e.g. merger or full acquisition).
Example: Beneficiary X merges with another existing entity Y by:
− becoming part of it (thus X and Y are together known as ‘Y’, and entity X ceases to exist) or
− establishing a new separate legal entity (X and Y are together known as ‘Z’).
If (exceptionally) the granting authority considers that the registered transfer affects the
action implementation, it will inform the coordinator (and instruct it to request an
amendment, if needed).
Example:
1. The legal form or type of organisation of the new entity differs from that of the former
beneficiary or affiliated entity and this has an impact on the implementation of the action.
2. The coordinator transfers all its rights and obligations to another legal entity. If this involves a
change of the bank account number in Data Sheet, each Grant Agreement in which it participates
as coordinator must be amended to update this information (AT12).
Information obligation — In case of a universal takeover, the beneficiary must — in
addition to updating the data in the Portal Participant Register— inform the coordinator via its
usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc) under
Article 19.
If a potential planned universal takeover could significantly affect or delay the implementation
of the action, the EU financial interests, the decision to award the grant or the compliance with
the Grant Agreement, the coordinator should flag this as soon as possible the granting
authority. The same applies if the universal takeover concerns an affiliated entity.

General > Article 40 — Accession and addition of new beneficiaries
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession form (see
Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry into force of the
Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of its entry into
force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must — within 30
days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and make any changes necessary
to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate
the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 39. It must
include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal Amendment
tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
1. Accession of beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
All beneficiaries (except the coordinator) must accede to the Grant Agreement by signing the
accession form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal. They must do this within 30 days after
the Grant Agreement enters into force (see Article 44). With the signature of this form, they
will assume the rights and be bound by the obligations under the Agreement with effect from
the date of its entry into force (retroactive).
Before being able to sign the accession form, each beneficiary will have to have provided
their declaration of honour (DoH) and those for its affiliated entities.
In addition, where required by the granting authority during grant preparation, the
beneficiaries concerned will have to have provided their declarations on joint and several
liability (see Annex 3a).
Affiliated entities or associated partners do not become parties to the Grant Agreement and
therefore do NOT need to sign an accession form.
The coordinator is NOT obliged to distribute hard copies of the Grant Agreement and
Accession Form to the other beneficiaries. All documents are available in the project file on
the Portal.
2. Addition of new beneficiaries (amendment)
What? In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request adding a new beneficiary.
337EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The new beneficiary must comply with the eligibility criteria of the call conditions, have
sufficient operational and financial capacity to perform the proposed tasks, comply with the
non-exclusion criteria and commit to implement the action under the same terms and
conditions as the other beneficiaries.
Mono-beneficiary grants can become multi-beneficiary grants, by addition of a new
beneficiary (new for 2021-2027).
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39).
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary.
Before, the new beneficiary must have taken all necessary steps to be able to participate as
beneficiary, i.e. register in the Participant Register and be validated — unless it already has a
validated participant identification code (PIC), provide his declaration on honour, provide a
declaration on joint and several liability of its affiliated entity (if required by the granting
authority), etc.
Effects:
The accession form must specify the accession date. It must be either:
− the date of signature of the accession form
− the date of entry into force of the amendment
OR
− a fixed date:
− either retroactive (i.e. before signature of the accession form)
OR
− future (i.e. after signature of the accession form — this should be an
exceptional case with a justification).
Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the
accession date may be set before the termination date (of the beneficiary that is replaced) —
so that both can incur costs for a certain period.

General > Article 41 — GA transfer
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the grant to a new
beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal Amendment
tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
1. GA transfers
What? In justified cases, mono-beneficiary grants may be transferred to a new beneficiary,
provided that certain conditions are complied with. Article 41 does not apply to multi-
beneficiary actions.
NO transfer can be conducted before the amendment has been accepted by the granting
authority. Transfers without a formal amendment are void and may result in grant
termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible until the granting authority has
approved the amendment.
‘Transfer’ means that the rights and obligations under the Grant Agreement are transferred
from the current beneficiary to a new beneficiary — without passing via termination (Article
32) or addition of a new beneficiary (Article 40.2).
The transfer may NOT call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants. The new beneficiary must comply with the
eligibility criteria of the call conditions, have sufficient operational and financial capacity to
perform the proposed tasks and commit to implement the action under the same terms and
conditions as the former beneficiary.
Example: The transfer will not be accepted if the new beneficiary does not fulfil the eligibility
conditions or does not have sufficient financial and operational capacity.
How? The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the
granting authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why. If the contracting authority considers that the reasons provided do
not justify the transfer, it may reject the request
339EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the accession form in Annex 3 (i.e. the statement to take over all rights and
obligations under the Grant Agreement) of the new beneficiary (signed directly in the
Portal)
− any other supporting documents required by the granting authority.
Effects:
If the request for the transfer of the Grant Agreement to a new beneficiary is accepted by the
granting authority, the Agreement will be amended to introduce the necessary changes and
the new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations thereof.
The transfer will take effect on the day of accession specified in the accession form (see
Annex 3).

General > Article 42 — Assignments of claims for payment against the granting authority
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE
GRANTING AUTHORITY
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE GRANTING
AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting authority to any third
party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority on the basis of a reasoned, written
request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed, the assignment
will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations towards the granting
authority.
1. Assignment of claims for payment
What? The beneficiaries may assign (i.e. transfer, sell or give) claims for payment (for work
carried out under the action) to a third party, if the granting authority has explicitly approved
it in writing and on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator.
Assignment has NO effect on the beneficiary’s obligations under the Grant Agreement; it
remains fully bound by them.
‘Assignments of rights’ are limited to claims for payment under Article 22.1. Transfers of
other rights or obligations (e.g. replacement of a beneficiary by the entity that bought it) are
governed by other provisions (e.g. amendments; see Article 39).
Only actual (i.e. existing) claims for payment may be assigned (including pre-financing).
Assignment is NOT possible for future claims.
How? Assignment of payment claims must be requested to the granting authority.
The request for approval must come from the coordinator, on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned. It must be in writing and must explain the reasons for the assignment.
The granting authority will assess the reasons given and approve or reject the request in
writing. In case the granting authority does not approve the assignment or if the terms of it
are not observed, the assignment will have no effect.
Examples (reasonable requests for assignment):
1. Assignment of a claim for payment for work carried out by a research laboratory sold after the
end of the action (but before payment of the balance) by a beneficiary to another legal entity.
2. Assignment for the benefit of creditors in a bankruptcy procedure.
If the assignment is linked to bankruptcy, the approval will also be subject to compliance with
national law.

43.2 Dispute settlement
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties must bring action
before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice — under Article 272 of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of Brussels, Belgium —
unless an association agreement to the EU programme provides for the enforceability of EU court
judgements under Article 272 TFEU.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet, Point 5), the
dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in accordance with the Rules for
Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under Article 299 TFEU
(see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the General Court — or, on appeal, the
Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions against offsetting
and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European Commission (not against the granting
authority; see also Article 22).
1. Dispute settlement
As a general rule, the Grant Agreements contain an Article 272 TFEU arbitration clause —
referring contractual disputes (i.e. disputes on the interpretation, application or validity of the
Grant Agreement) to the EU Courts (General Court).
An Article 272 action is ONLY possible once the granting authority position is final (i.e.
against confirmation letters, debit notes, etc.; NOT against audit reports, audit letters, pre-
information letters, etc).
Bringing an action against the granting authority:
− for grants signed by the European Commission: actions must be brought against the
Commission
− for grants signed by an EU executive agency or other EU body: actions must be brought
against the Agency or EU body.
For disputes of public law nature (i.e. which concern administrative sanctions, offsetting or
enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU; see Articles 22 and 34) actions must be
brought before the EU courts (General Court) under Article 263 TFEU (NOT before any other
court and NOT under Article 272).
Public law measures must ALWAYS be brought to the European Court of Justice under Article
263 TFEU (including actions brought by non-EU beneficiaries).
All procedures are organised in a way that the beneficiaries will always be informed about
what they can do if they disagree (means of redress information in the letters).
Specific cases (dispute settlement):
344EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Non-EU beneficiaries — Contractual disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium. The only exception concerns non-EU beneficiaries which are for the
purpose of the action considered to be established in an associated country and where the
corresponding association agreement to the EU programme provides for the enforceability of
EU court judgments under Article 272 TFEU. In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must
bring the contractual dispute before the EU courts (General Court).
International organisations (IOs) — Are the only types of beneficiaries that can make use
of arbitration in EU grants, as a special means of disputes settlement (provided that the
option is activated in the Grant Agreement; see Data sheet).
Thus, for international organisations, contractual disputes are referred to the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (instead of the EU General Court) and EU granting authorities will
normally avoid adopting public law measures, such as enforceable decisions under Article 299
TFEU or decisions on administrative sanctions (see Article 34). Offsetting remains possible
also against international organisations (as contractual measure, see Article 22.4).

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY (— ARTICLE 13)
[OPTION for programmes with security requirements: Sensitive information with security
recommendation
Sensitive information with a security recommendation must comply with the additional requirements
imposed by the granting authority.
Before starting the action tasks concerned, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals or other
mandatory documents needed for implementing the task. The documents must be kept on file and be
submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting authority. If they are not in English, they must be
submitted together with an English summary.
For requirements restricting disclosure or dissemination, the information must be handled in accordance with
the recommendation and may be disclosed or disseminated only after written approval from the granting
authority.]
[OPTION for programmes with EU classified information (standard): EU classified information
If EU classified information is used or generated by the action, it must be treated in accordance with the
security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter (SAL) set out in Annex 1 and Decision
2015/44449 and its implementing rules — until it is declassified.
Deliverables which contain EU classified information must be submitted according to special procedures
agreed with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving EU classified information may be subcontracted only with prior explicit written
approval from the granting authority and only to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU
country with a security of information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission).
EU classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants involved in the
action implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the granting authority.]
49 Commission Decision 2015/444/EC, Euratom of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU classified information (OJ L 72,
17.3.2015, p. 53).
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on confidentiality and security (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, EMFAF,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
Some programmes with calls that may involve sensitive or classified information (HE, DEP,
CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM) also have specific provisions on confidentiality and
security in Annex 5.
They cover sensitive information with security recommendations and EU classified
information.
347EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Sensitive information with a security recommendation (HE)
For these programmes, proposals may have to undergo a security review before selection
and may, if there are security issues, be made subject to specific security recommendations.
Examples (security issues): information on gaps and vulnerabilities in existing systems or
critical infrastructures, design, characteristics and requirements of devices used in detection, law-
enforcement measures to counter terrorism, tools and methodologies for predicting and detecting
organised criminal activities, etc.
Examples (security recommendations): classification, limited dissemination, establishment
of a security advisory board, appointment of a project security officer, limiting the level of detail,
using a fake scenario, etc.
Sensitive information concerning commercial secrets, know-how, etc are NOT sensitive
information within the meaning of Annex 5. Commercially sensitive information is already
protected under Article 13.1.
The most common security recommendations concern restricted disclosure or limited
dissemination. This leads to the creation of deliverables, which are sensitive information with
security recommendation. They are listed in Annex 1 (DoA, security section). If this is the
case, third parties should have no access them. Thus, before disclosure or dissemination to a
third party, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator, who must request written approval
from the granting authority. Other security recommendations concern the appointment of
security staff (security officers, security advisory board), specific measures for access to IT
systems, etc.
Some security requirements must be taken care of before grant signature, but most are for
implementation during the grant.
In addition, beneficiaries must obtain — before the start of the action task for which they are
needed — all the necessary security approvals, opinions, notifications and authorisations
(e.g. to security committees, etc). These documents do not need to be submitted, but must
be kept on file and provided on request (e.g. in case of security checks or audits). They must
be able to show that the opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the tasks to be
undertaken in the context of the action. If the documents are not in English, they may be
asked to provide an English summary.
Best practice: When preparing the applications for approvals/opinions/notifications/
authorisations, you should request the assistance of security experts, security
departments/committees and of your organisation’s data protection officer, if relevant.
In case of changes to the security situation, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator,
which must immediately inform the granting authority and, if necessary, request for Annex 1
to be amended.
The granting authority may carry out security checks or audits, to ensure that the
beneficiaries have properly implemented the security requirements and obtained the
opinions/notifications/authorisations (see Article 25).
3. EU classified information (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
Projects with EU classified information will moreover have to comply with the provisions
linked to EU classified information (see Article 13.2).
The project will have to follow a security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter
(SAL) which set out the classification-level and the measures that need to be taken to protect
the information. Both need to be added to Annex 1.
348EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Only entities listed in the security section of Annex 1 can have access to EU classified
information used or generated by the project. Before disclosure or dissemination to a third
party (including other participants involved in the action), the beneficiaries must inform the
coordinator, which must request written approval from the granting authority.
In case of changes to the security situation, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator,
which must immediately inform the granting authority and, if necessary, request for Annex 1
to be amended.
Deliverables containing EU classified information must be submitted following the special
procedure agreed with the granting authority, as described in the programme security
instruction (PSI) (e.g. HE PSI, DEP PSI, EDF PSI, ASAP PSI).
Action tasks involving EU classified information may ONLY be subcontracted (cumulative
conditions):
− to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission) and
− if the granting authority has explicitly approved such requests in writing.

[OPTION for programmes with specific ethics rules: Ethics
Actions involving activities raising ethics issues must be carried out in compliance with:
- ethical principles [(including the highest standards of research integrity)]
and
- applicable EU, international and national law, including [the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights
and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and
its Supplementary Protocols][[other programme-specific legal acts]].
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to [the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the
right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of persons, the right to
non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the environment and high levels of human health
protection].
Before the beginning of an action task raising an ethical issue, the beneficiaries must have obtained all
approvals or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any (national or
local) ethics committee or other bodies [such as data protection authorities].
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting
authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary, which shows
that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the conclusions of the committee or
authority concerned (if any).]
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14) (HE, RFCS)
[OPTION for programmes with specific ethics and research integrity rules: Ethics and research integrity
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
- ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity) and
- applicable EU, international and nationallaw, including the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its
Supplementary Protocols.
No funding can be granted, within or outside the EU, for activities that are prohibited in all Member States.
No funding can be granted in a Member State for an activity which is forbiddenin that Member State.
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the
right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of persons, the right to
non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the environment and high levels of human health
protection.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action have an exclusive focus on civil
applications.
350EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action do not:
- aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes
- intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such modifications
heritable (with the exception of research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads, which may be
financed)
- intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell
procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or
- lead to the destruction of human embryos (for example, for obtaining stem cells).
[Activities involving research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells may be carried out only
if:
- they are set out in Annex 1 or
- the coordinator has obtained explicit approval (in writing) from the granting authority.]
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the fundamental principle of research integrity —as set out in the
European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity59.
This implies compliance with the following principles:
- reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis
and the use of resources
- honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a
transparent, fair and unbiased way
- respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the
environment
- accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organisation, for
training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts
and means that beneficiaries must ensure that persons carrying out research tasks follow the good research
practices including ensuring, where possible, openness, reproducibility and traceability and refrain from the
research integrity violations described in the Code.
Activities raising ethical issues must comply with the additional requirements formulated by the ethics
panels (including after checks, reviews or audits; see Article 25).
Before starting an action task raising ethical issues, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals or
other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any (national or local) ethics
committee or other bodies such as data protection authorities.
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting
authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary, which shows
that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the conclusions of the committee or
authority concerned (if any).
59 European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity of ALLEA (All European Academies).
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on ethics (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
351EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Some programmes with ethics-sensitive calls (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI) also have specific provisions on ethics in Annex 5.
Depending on the programme, the obligations may vary.
2. Ethical principles and applicable law (HE, RFCS)
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
− ethical principles (including, where applicable the highest standards of research
integrity) and
− applicable international, EU and national law.
The main ethical principles depend on the domain. For research and innovation related
domains, they are:
Main ethical principles:
▪ Respecting human dignity and integrity
▪ Ensuring honesty and transparency towards research subjects and notably
getting free and informed consent (as well as assent whenever relevant)
▪ Protecting vulnerable persons
▪ Ensuring privacy and confidentiality
▪ Promoting justice and inclusiveness
▪ Minimising harm and maximising benefit
▪ Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially if the research
is being carried out in developing countries
▪ Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction
and refinement (‘3Rs’) in animal research
▪ Respecting and protecting the environment and future generations
The key sources of EU and international law are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols (for
other texts). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (UN CRPD). In addition, some programmes mention sector-specific legislation
(such as, for instance, the EU Directives on animal health and organic-labelling for EMFAF).
3. Exclusive focus on civil applications (HE and RFCS)
For programmes with this provision (HE and RFCS), the activities under the action must have
an exclusive focus on civil applications.
This does not mean that the research results cannot peripherally be useful in a military
context. Research related to dual-use products or technologies (usually used for civilian
purposes but with possible military applications) is not prohibited (e.g. development of an
algorithm that might also be used for optimising military logistics). However, activities that
focus on military applications will NOT be funded (e.g. development of a robot designed for
military intervention).
4. Prohibited activities and activities involving research on human embryos or
human embryonic stem cells (HE)
Prohibited activities may not take place under the action.
352EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Activities that involve human embryos (hE) or human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can only
be funded, if:
− they comply with the Statement by the Commission on research activities involving
human embryos or human embryonic stem cells54 (in particular, do NOT result in the
destruction of human embryos)
and
− they are set out in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement or
− the coordinator has obtained explicit approval by the granting authority.
These activities are de facto considered as raising sensitive ethics issues and must always
undergo an ethics assessment (see below) that can lead to ethics requirements that will be
included in Annex 1.
5. Research integrity (HE and RFCS)
In order to meet the highest standards of research integrity, the beneficiaries must follow the
principles listed in this provision and ensure that the persons carrying out research tasks
comply with the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (i.e. follow the good
research practices listed in this Code and refrain from any research integrity violations it
describes).
They also must ensure that appropriate procedures, policies and structures are in place to
foster responsible research practices, to prevent questionable research practices and
research misconduct, and to handle allegations of breaches of the principles and standards in
the Code of Conduct (see Guidelines for Promoting Research Integrity in Research Performing
Organisation).
Fundamental research integrity principles:
▪ reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the
methodology, the analysis and the use of resources
▪ honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating
research in a transparent, fair and unbiased way
▪ respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural
heritage and the environment
▪ accountability for the research from the idea to publication, for its management
and organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider
impacts.
The Code constitutes a general reference framework and takes into account the legitimate
interests of the beneficiaries (i.e. regarding IPRs and data sharing). This does not change the
other obligations under this Agreement or obligations under applicable international, EU or
national law, all of which still apply.
In addition, beneficiaries should rely on local, national or discipline-specific guidelines, if such
documents exist and are not contrary to the Code.

185/01).
353EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
6. Activities raising ethics issues (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
For these programmes, proposals may have to undergo an ethics review before selection and
will, if one or more ethics issues are identified, be made subject to ethics requirements to be
solved immediately or implement during the grant. In the latter case, they will be included
as deliverables in Annex 1.
Examples (ethics issues): involvement of patients, volunteers, children or vulnerable
populations; use of human (embryonic) stem cells; implication of developing countries; collecting
and processing of personal data; use of animals; risk of environmental impact.
Examples (ethics deliverables): to submit to the granting authority a report on certain ethics
issues during the course of the action.
Examples (ethics requirements before grant signature): confirmation personal data of this
study will not be transferred outside the EU.
In addition, beneficiaries must obtain — before starting an action task raising ethical issues —
all the necessary ethics opinions, notifications and authorisations. These documents do not
need to be submitted, but must be kept on file and provided on request (in case of ethics
reviews, checks or audits). They must be able to show that the
opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the tasks to be undertaken in the context of the
action. If the documents are not in English, beneficiaries may be asked to provide an English
summary.
Best practice: When preparing the applications for such opinions/notifications/ authorisations,
beneficiaries should request the assistance of ethics experts, research ethics
departments/committees and of their organisation’s data protection officer.
The granting authority may carry out ethics checks or reviews to ensure that the beneficiaries
have properly implemented the ethics requirements and obtained the
opinions/notifications/authorisations (see Article 25).
Specific cases (ethics):
Activities carried out in a non-EU country — Such activities must comply with the laws of
that country AND be allowed in at least one EU Member State. The beneficiaries must sign
the related declaration in their application.
For more guidance on ethics, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment.

VALUES (— ARTICLE 14) (HE, RFCS)
[OPTION for programmes with gender rules: Gender mainstreaming
The beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities between men and women in the
implementation of the action and, where applicable, in line with the gender equality plan. They must aim, to
the extent possible, for a gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the action, including at
supervisory and managerial level.]
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on EU values (HE and RFCS)
For some programmes (HE and RFCS), Annex 5 includes specific provisions on EU values.
2. Gender mainstreaming (HE and RFCS)
The beneficiaries must take all measures:
− to promote gender equality, i.e. equal opportunities between men and women in the
implementation of the action, and
− in line with their gender equality plan (GEP), if applicable.
Promote gender equality:
The beneficiaries should:
− aim for a balanced participation of women and men in their research teams
− being proactive in ensuring gender balance among the individuals who are primarily
responsible for carrying out the work (in accordance with the categories defined in
the monitoring system)
− being proactive in promoting gender equality among consortium members and
participants in the implementation of the action.
Examples (measures to promote gender equality within a project): Transparency of
recruitment and advancement processes, including gender-sensitive language in vacancies and job-
descriptions; plans and conditions for career advancement; transparent gender equal wage
classification and grading of jobs; development of leadership opportunities; gender planning and
budgeting; gender impact assessment of policies; climate surveys of institutions; trainings on
unconscious gender biases in recruitment and assessment of researchers, as well as in
collaborative work; adoption of family-friendly policies; promotion of gender-sensitive mobility and
dual-career couples schemes; measures to prevent and address gender based violence such as
sexual harassment.
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must aim — to the extent possible —
for a gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the action, including at the
supervisory and managerial levels.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken and measures put in place (see Article 20).
355EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In addition, the gender dimension should be integrated in research and innovation content.
This is a by default requirement for all Horizon Europe RIA/IA and Programme Cofund
actions, with some exceptions.
For more guidance on gender equality, including the integration of the gender dimension into
research and innovation content, see HE Programme Guide > Gender equality.
Gender equality plan:
The gender equality plan (GEP) is an eligibility criterion for participating in Horizon Europe
actions for legal entities from Member States and HE associated countries that are:
− public bodies
− research organisations
− higher education establishments.
The ‘gender equality plan’ is a document that sets out the gender equality strategy of an
organisation.
The GEP does not apply to other types of legal entities e.g. private for-profit organisations,
including SMEs, non-governmental or civil society organisations.
The GEP (or equivalent document) must cover the following minimum process-related
requirements:
− publication: a formal document published on the institution’s website and endorsed
by the top management. Endorsement can refer to the signature of the document, the
minutes of the management meeting where the decision was taken, a press release
informing about its approval or a document having a foreword and/or other form of
top management statement.
− dedicated resources: commitment of resources to implement the plan
− data collection and monitoring: regular (at least once in two years) collection of
sex/gender disaggregated data on personnel (and students, for the establishments
concerned) as well as regular (at least once in two years) reporting based on
indicators
− training: awareness raising/training on gender equality for staff and decision-makers.
Content-wise, the GEP should address the following areas, using concrete measures and
targets:
− work-life balance and organisational culture
− gender balance in leadership and decision-making
− gender equality in recruitment and career progression
− integration of the gender dimension into research and teaching content
− measures against gender-based violence, including sexual harassment.
Costs relating to the GEP (including for its implementation/updates) are NOT eligible (since
they relate to an eligibility criterion for participating).
More information on the GEP in Horizon Europe is available here and in these FAQ.

protecting or exploiting the results, including by scientific [or professional] publications
in any medium.
Exploit(ation) — The use of results in further [innovation and deployment] activities other than those
covered by the action concerned, including among other things, commercial exploitation
such as developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, creating
and providing a service, or in standardisation activities.
Fair and reasonable conditions — Appropriate conditions, including possible financial terms or royalty-free
conditions, taking into account the specific circumstances of the request for access, for

envisaged.
List of background [— Background free from restrictions]
The beneficiaries must, where industrial and intellectual property rights (including rights of third parties)
exist prior to the Agreement, establish a list of these pre-existing industrial and intellectual property rights,
specifying the rights owners.
The coordinator must — before starting the action — submit this list to the granting authority.
[Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic autonomy reasons,
background that is subject to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not
one of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the results (i.e.
would make the results subject to control or restrictions) must not be used and must be explicitly excluded in

The beneficiaries must grant access to their results — on a royalty-free basis — to the granting authority,
other EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, for developing, implementing and monitoring EU policies
or programmes. [Such access does not extend to beneficiaries’ background.]
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
[The access rights also extend to national authorities of EU Member States or associated countries, for
developing, implementing and monitoring their policies or programmes in this area. In this case, access is
subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency (including the granting
authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.]
[Access rights for the granting authority to results in case of a public emergency

Access rights for national authorities to the special report for use by/for armed forces or security or
intelligence forces
For Research Actions, the beneficiaries must grant access to the special report — on a royalty-free basis — to
national authorities of EU Member States or associated countries for use by/for their armed forces or security
or intelligence forces (including in the framework of cooperative programmes).
‘Special report’ means the specific deliverable summarising the results of a research project and providing
information on the basic principles, aims, outcomes, basic properties, tests performed, potential benefits,
potential defence applications and expected exploitation path of the research towards development. It may
also include information on the ownership of IPRs.
Access to the special report will be granted by the granting authority, after having ensured that appropriate
confidentiality obligations are in place.
Access rights for third parties to further develop results
For Research Actions, the beneficiaries must grant access — on a royalty-free basis — to results which are
necessary for the execution of other EU grants or contracts between national authorities of two or more EU
Member States or associated countries and one or more beneficiaries, to further develop together results
generated by the action.
In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.]

For this section, references to ‘beneficiary’or ‘beneficiaries’do not include affiliated entities (if any).]
[Agreement on background — Background free from restrictions
The beneficiaries must identify in a written agreement the background as needed for implementing the action
or for exploiting its results.
Where the call conditions restrict control due to strategic interests reasons, background that is subject to
control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries
or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the exploitation of the results (i.e. would

Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them.[[…]]
361EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
[However, two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:
- they have jointly generated them and
- it is not possible to:
- establishthe respective contribution of each beneficiary, or
- separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection.
The joint owners must agree —in writing —on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership
(‘joint ownership agreement’), to ensure compliance with their obligations under this Agreement.
Unless otherwise agreed in the joint ownership agreement or consortium agreement, each joint owner may
grant non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the jointly-owned results (without any right to sub-
license), if the other joint owners are given:
- at least 45 days advance notice and
- fair and reasonable compensation.
The joint owners may agree —in writing —to apply another regime than joint ownership.
If third parties (including employees and other personnel) may claim rights to the results, the beneficiary
concerned must ensure that those rights can be exercised in a manner compatible with its obligations under
the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must indicate the owner(s) of the results (results ownership list) in the final periodic
report.]
Protection of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must adequately protect their results —for an
appropriate period and with appropriate territorial coverage —if protection is possible and justified, taking
into account all relevant considerations, including the prospects for commercial exploitation, the legitimate
interests of the other beneficiaries and any other legitimate interests.
Exploitation of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must —up to four years after the end of the action
(see Data Sheet, Point 1) —use their best efforts to exploit their results directly or to have them exploited
indirectly by another entity, in particular through transfer or licensing.
[If, despite a beneficiary’s best efforts, the results are not exploited within one year after the end of the
action, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the granting authority) use the Horizon
Results Platform to find interested parties to exploit the results.
If results are incorporated in a standard, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed with the granting
authority or unless it is impossible) ask the standardisation body to include the funding statement (see Article
17) in (information related to) the standard.]
[Additional exploitation obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations (including obligations linked to the
restriction of participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons), the
beneficiaries must comply with them —up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency, the
beneficiaries must (if requested by the granting authority) grant for a limited period of time specified in the
request,non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable conditions — to their results to legal entities that
need the results to address the public emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting
products and services at fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after the end
of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
362EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Additional information obligation relating to standards
Where the call conditions impose additional informationobligations relating to possible standardisation,the
beneficiaries must —up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —inform the
granting authority, if the results could reasonably be expected to contribute to European or international
standards.
Transfer and licensing of results
Transfer of ownership
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect compliance with their
obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under the Agreement regarding their results are passed on
to the new owner and that this new owner has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer.
Moreover, they must inform the other beneficiaries with access rights of the transfer at least 45 days in
advance (or less if agreed in writing), unless agreed otherwise in writing for specifically identified third
parties including affiliated entities or unless impossible under the applicable law. This notification must
include sufficient information on the new owner to enable the beneficiaries concerned to assess the effects on
their access rights. The beneficiaries may object within 30 days of receiving notification (or less if agreed in
writing), if they can show that the transfer would adversely affect their access rights. In this case, the transfer
may not take place until agreement has been reached between the beneficiaries concerned.
Granting licences
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results (or otherwise give the right to exploit them), including on
an exclusive basis, provided this does not affect compliance with their obligations.
Exclusive licences for results may be granted only if all the other beneficiaries concerned have waived their
access rights.
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing [— Horizon Europe actions]
Where the call conditions in Horizon Europe actions provide for the right to object to transfers or licensing,
the granting authority may — up to [four][[…]] years after the endof the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —
object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results, if:
- [the beneficiaries which generated the results have received funding under the grant]
- it is to a legal entity established in a non-EU country not associated with Horizon Europe, and
- the granting authority considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests.
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting
authority before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation of the results,
and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU interests, in
particular regarding competitiveness as well as consistency with [ethical principles and security
considerations].
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the granting authority decides to object to a transfer or exclusive licence, it must formally notify the
beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information it has
requested).
363EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
No transfer or licensing may take place in the following cases:
- pending the granting authority decision, within the period set out above
- if the granting authority objects
- until the conditions are complied with, if the granting authority objection comes with conditions.
A beneficiary may formally notify a request to waive the right to object regarding intended transfers or grants
to a specifically identified third party, if measures safeguarding EU interests are in place. If the granting
authority agrees, it will formally notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or
any additional information requested).
[Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing — Euratom actions
Where the call conditions in Euratom actions provide for the right to object to transfers or licensing,the
granting authority may — up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —object to a
transfer of ownership or the exclusive or non-exclusive licensing of results, if:
- the beneficiaries which generated the results have received funding under the grant
- it is to a legal entity established in a non-EU country not associated to the Euratom Research and
Training Programme 2021-2025 and
- the granting authority considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with the EU interests.
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant a licence must formally notify the granting authority
before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the results, the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation of
the results, and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU interests, in
particular regarding competitiveness as well as consistency with ethical principles and security
considerations (including the defence interests of the EU Member States under Article 24 of the
Euratom Treaty).
The granting authoritymay request additional information.
If the granting authoritydecides to object to a transfer or licence, it will formally notify the beneficiary
concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information requested).
No transfer or licensing may take place in the following cases:
- pending the granting authoritydecision, within the period set out above
- if the granting authorityobjects
- until the conditions are complied with, if the granting authority objection comes with conditions.
A beneficiary may formally notify a request to waive the right to object regarding intended transfers or grants
to a specifically identified third party, if measures safeguarding EU interests are in place. If the granting
authority agrees, it will formally notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or
any additional information requested).]
[Limitations to transfers and licensing due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons of the
EU and its Member States
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons, the beneficiaries may not transfer ownership of their results or grant licences to third parties
which are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions(or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless they
have requested and received prior approval by the granting authority.
364EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The request must:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation of the results,
and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or license on the [strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States].
The granting authority may request additional information.]
Access rights to results and background
[Exercise of access rights — Waiving of access rights — No sub-licensing
Requests to exercise access rights and the waiver of access rights must be in writing.
Unless agreed otherwise in writing with the beneficiary granting access, access rights do not include the right
to sub-license.
If a beneficiary is no longer involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant access.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary no longer has
access rights.]
[Access rights for implementing the action
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —on a royalty-free basis —to background needed to
implement their own tasks under the action, unless the beneficiary that holds the background has —before
acceding to the Agreement —:
- informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is subject to restrictions, or
- agreed with the other beneficiaries that access would not be ona royalty-free basis.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —on a royalty-free basis —to results needed for
implementing their own tasks under the action.]
[Access rights for exploiting the results
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —under fair and reasonable conditions —to results needed for
exploiting their results.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —under fair and reasonable conditions —to background
needed for exploiting their results, unless the beneficiary thatholds the background has —before acceding to
the Agreement —informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is subject to restrictions.
Requests for access must be made —unless agreed otherwise in writing —up to one year after the end of the
action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
[Access rights for entities under the same control
Unless agreed otherwise in writing by the beneficiaries, access to results and, subject to the restrictions
referred to above (if any), background must also be granted —under fair and reasonable conditions —to
entities that:
- are established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe associated country
- are under the direct or indirect control of another beneficiary, or under the same direct or indirect
control as that beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling that beneficiary and
- need the access to exploit the results of that beneficiary.
Unless agreed otherwise in writing, such requests for access must be made by the entity directly to the
beneficiary concerned.
Requests for access must be made —unless agreed otherwise in writing —up to one year after the end of the
action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
365EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
[Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and national authorities
to results for policy purposes [— Horizon Europe actions]
[In Horizon Europe actions,] the beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must grant access
to their results —on a royalty-free basis —to the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or
agencies for developing, implementing and monitoring EU policies or programmes. Such access rights do not
extend to beneficiaries’ background.
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
For actions under the cluster ‘Civil Security for Society’, such access rights also extend to national
authorities of EU Member States for developing, implementing and monitoring their policies or programmes
in this area. In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency (including the granting
authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.]
[Access rights for the granting authority, Euratom institutions, funding bodies or the Joint Undertaking
Fusion for Energy — Euratom actions
In Euratom actions, the beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must grant access to their
results —on a royalty-free basis —to the granting authority, Euratom institutions, funding bodies or the Joint
Undertaking Fusion for Energy for developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and
programmes or for compliance with obligations assumed through international cooperation with non-EU
countries and international organisations.
Such access rights include the right to authorise third parties to use the results in public procurement and the
right to sub-license and are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.]
Additional access rights
Where the call conditions impose additional access rights, the beneficiaries must comply with them.]
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on IPR, background and results (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules regarding background and results and linked
intellectual property rights.
Most programmes use the standard set of additional rules concerning rights of use by the
granting authority of results for information, communication, dissemination and publicity
purposes. Some programmes (especially HE, RFCS, DEP and EDF) use more customised
provisions that may vary from programme to programme.
For Horizon Europe, the references to ‘beneficiary’ or ‘beneficiaries’ in this section do NOT
include affiliated entities. However, there are specific access rights provisions for entities under the
same control in line with the HE Regulation 2021/695 (e.g. for access rights).
2. List of background (some programmes)
366EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Programmes with actions that rely a lot on pre-existing data, know-how or information
including linked intellectual property rights, have a provision obliging the beneficiaries to
establish a so-called ‘list of background’. This list should include both background owned by
project participants and rights owned by third parties. It will allow the consortium to make
sure that everyone has the rights they need for their part of the project.
Depending on the programme, the list remains either consortium-internal or must be shared
with the granting authority (usually before starting the action).
3. Rights of use on results for information, communication, dissemination and
publicity purposes (most programmes)
Most programmes contain a provision allowing the granting authority to use results for
information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes.
This concerns only non-sensitive information and aims mainly the communication and
dissemination activities that are part of the programme management (e.g. press
communications, stakeholder consultations, results portals, media and web-presence, etc).
4. Agreement on background (some programmes)
For some programmes, the list of background must be defined in a written agreement, in
which the beneficiaries identify and agree on what constitutes background for their action.
This list will be the basis for the access obligations.
Specific cases (background):
Limitations to use of background due to security or strategic interests (restricted
calls) (HE, DEP, EDF) — Where the work programme/call conditions provide for restricted
participation (e.g. due to security or strategic interests reasons), background that is subject
to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the
eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that would impact the
exploitation of the results should normally not be used (if possible).
The precise scope of this provision depends on the programme. Please cross-check with
the Grant Agreement you signed!
‘Background that impacts the exploitation of results’ should be understood as making the
exploitation of those results subject to control or restrictions, for example if exploitation
would require the agreement of the entity owning the background. If such background needs
to be used, this must first be agreed with the granting authority.
5. Ownership of results (HE)
Results belong to the beneficiary that generated/produced them (see Article 16.2).
Best practice: To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, keep documents such as laboratory
notebooks to show who produced the results, how and when.
If others (‘third parties’) could claim rights on results, the beneficiaries must ensure that they
can respect their obligations under the grant by making arrangements (transfers, licences,
other) with the third parties (e.g. affiliated entities, associated partners, associated partners
linked to a beneficiary in MSCA, employees, subcontractors, other members of Joint research
units (JRUs), etc). Such arrangements could be separate between the beneficiaries and the
third party, or in the consortium agreement if they concern affiliated entities or associated
partners. If making such arrangements is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using
the third party to generate the results.
Examples (third parties that may claim rights): academic institutions in countries that have a
kind of ‘professor’s privilege’ system (according to which researchers may have some rights to the
367EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
results of university research); employees or students who carry out work for the action (if they
have rights under national law or their contract); beneficiaries for which affiliated entities carry out
a part of the work.
Examples (arrangements): transferring (partial) ownership to the beneficiary; granting access
rights to the beneficiary with a right to sub-license.
The list of owners of the results generated by the action must be provided to the granting
authority at the end of the action in the final reporting (results ownership list (ROL)).
In case of joint ownership, all joint owners must be listed even if (some of) the joint owners
are not members of the consortium. The results ownership list provides a snapshot in time,
meaning that ownership changes may happen after the submission of the final periodic
report.
If the ownership of the results is not clear, the beneficiaries should indicate all potential
owners.
Example: A beneficiary is involved in a legal dispute on the ownership.
Specific cases (ownership of results):
Results generated by associated partners — For results generated by associated
partners, the situation is similar to that of beneficiaries not having received funds within the
meaning of the HE Regulation 2021/695. Provisions in the Annex 5 that apply only to
‘beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant’ do NOT apply (e.g. the obligation
to protect the results or the best efforts obligation to exploit the results). Respect of all other
obligations (e.g. obligation to provide access if needed to implement the project or exploit the
results or obligations related to dissemination/open science) must be ensured.
Automatic joint ownership — If beneficiaries have jointly generated results and it is not
possible to establish their respective contribution or to separate them for protection, the
beneficiaries automatically become joint owners.
In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must conclude a joint ownership agreement (in
writing).
This agreement should cover in particular:
Joint ownership agreement content:
▪ how the ownership is divided (e.g. equally or not).
▪ if/how the joint results will be protected, including issues related to the cost of
protection (e.g. patent filing and examination fees, renewal fees, prior state-of-
the-art searches, infringement actions, etc), or to the sharing of revenues or
profits.
▪ how the joint results will be exploited and disseminated.
▪ how disputes will be settled (e.g. via a mediator, applicable law, etc).
Best practice: Include at least general principles on joint ownership already in the consortium
agreement to make it easier to negotiate a full joint ownership agreement later on.
Unless otherwise provided in the consortium agreement or the joint ownership agreement,
the joint owners automatically have the right to grant non-exclusive licences to third parties
against fair and reasonable compensation (without prior authorisation from the other joint
owners). The joint owner that intends to grant the licence must give the other joint owners at
least 45 days advance notice (together with sufficient information, to check if the proposed
compensation is fair and reasonable). Such licences may not include sub-licensing.
368EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The joint owners may agree in writing not to continue with joint ownership and apply another
regime.
Example: The joint owners may transfer ownership to a single owner and agree on more
favourable access rights (or on any other fair counterpart). In such case, the rules regarding
transfer of ownership apply.
The joint owners may agree to apply another regime even before the results are generated,
e.g. in the consortium agreement, if they consider it appropriate.
Joint ownership by agreement — Outside the cases described above, the beneficiaries
may also become joint owners if they specifically agree on it.
Example: A beneficiary may decide that a part of its results will be owned jointly with its parent
company or another third party. Also in this case, the rules regarding transfer or ownership apply.
6. Protection of results (HE)
‘Beneficiaries having received funding under the grant’ must:
– examine the possibility of protecting their results and
– if possible and justified taking into account all relevant considerations, protect them.
Examples (no protection necessary): If protection is impossible under EU or national law or not
justified (in view of the absence of potential for commercial or industrial exploitation, if the action’s
objective does not require protection, if additionally protecting a part of certain technology would
not bring significantly broader protection, etc)
Beneficiaries are in principle free to choose any available form of protection, but protection
should be adequate depending on the characteristics of the results to ensure effective
protection. While some forms of IP protection, such as copyright, do not require registration,
others, such as patent, trade marks or industrial design require the filing of an application
before the relevant registration body. Although important for commercial and industrial
exploitation, IP protection is not mandatory, if not justified.
Standard forms of protection:
▪ Patent
▪ Trademark
▪ Industrial design
▪ Copyright
Examples: Protection for a design: e.g. industrial design, copyright.
In some cases, it may be advisable to protect an invention by keeping it confidential as a
trade secret, or to postpone the filing of a patent (or other IPR) application.
Example (better not to protect for the moment): Keeping an invention (temporarily)
confidential could allow further development of the invention while avoiding the negative
consequences associated with premature filing (earlier priority and filing dates, early publication,
possible rejection due to lack of support or industrial applicability, etc) but this requires careful
consideration given the possible risks of such an approach.
Best practice: Consider seeking expert advice to help you to decide whether and how to
protect results.
Costs related to protection are eligible, if they fulfil the cost eligibility conditions set out in
Article 6.
369EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
When deciding on protection, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’
legitimate interests. Any other beneficiary invoking legitimate interests must demonstrate
how the decision would harm them. The mere fact that the protection would establish an
exclusive right which could affect beneficiaries which are competitors is not a legitimate
interest.
Example (harm): The protection could lead to the disclosure of valuable background that is held
by the other beneficiary (as a trade secret or flagged as confidential) and may require coordination.
Best practice: Although beneficiaries are not required to consult other beneficiaries before
deciding whether to protect their results or not, it may be advisable to provide for
arrangements (either in the consortium agreement or in separate agreements), to ensure
that where needed decisions on protection take due account of the interests of all
beneficiaries concerned.
Protection should last for an appropriate period and have appropriate territorial coverage (in
view of potential) commercial or industrial exploitation and other elements (e.g. potential
markets and countries in which potential competitors are located).
Patent applications should identify the rightful inventors.
Example (not rightful inventor): An entity systematically designates a head of department as
one of the inventors, although it is not true.
Be aware that errors (or fraud) in identifying inventors may lead to the invalidation of
the patent.
7. Exploitation of results (HE)
The beneficiaries must take measures aiming to ensure the exploitation of their results —
either by themselves (e.g. a beneficiary owning results uses them directly) or indirectly by
others (other beneficiaries or third parties, e.g. through licensing or by transferring the
ownership of results).
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific
measures to try to ensure that their results are exploited (to the extent possible and
justified).
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken (see Article 20).
Security obligations — Exploitation must be compliant with other grant obligations,
such as security rules (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
Where possible, these measures should be consistent with the impact expected from the
action and the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results. The exploitation of
results should take into consideration the objectives of the Horizon Europe Programme (see
specific objectives in Article 3(2) of the HE Regulation 2021/695), including promoting
innovation in the EU and strengthening the European Research Area.
The ’plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities’
is a document that details the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that
will be carried out during the project (or afterwards) , to achieve the expected impact.
All proposals must (unless explicitly excluded by the work programme/call conditions),
include a first version of the plan (summary of the planned activities under the description of
the impact pathways). If successful, the projects will then have to provide the complete plan
for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities (normally
within the first six months of the action and then regularly update it). Moreover, beneficiaries
370EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
will have to report on the activities undertaken. See Annex 5 > Communication,
dissemination and visibility.
‘Exploitation’ (as defined at the beginning of Annex 5) means the use of results in further
research and innovation activities other than those covered by the action concerned,
including among other things, commercial exploitation such as developing, creating,
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in
standardisation activities.
Exploitation can also be non commercial, for example use in non-commercial research
or non-commercial teaching activities. When results of the action are used to influence R&I
policy or decision making, this is another form of exploitation.
Best practice: Consider applying for dissemination and exploitation support services,
including go to market support and IP management provided by the European Commission,
during and after the end of your action i.e. the Horizon Results Booster. This service is
available to all running and finished projects.
The best effort obligation applies only to ‘beneficiaries having received funding under the
grant’ and applies during the action and up to four years after the end of the action.
Specific case (exploitation of results):
Additional exploitation obligations (HE) — Where the work programme/call conditions
provide for additional exploitation obligations, those obligations must also be complied
with/fulfilled (by ALL beneficiaries, unless explicitly stated otherwise).
Additional information obligation relating to standards (HE) — Where the work
programme/call conditions provide for this additional obligation, the beneficiaries must
moreover inform the granting authority on any results that could contribute to European or
international standards.
Example: The results are produced in an area in which standards play an important role (such as
in mobile communication, diagnostics or immunological diseases).
Public emergency — Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional
exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency, when requested by the granting
authority, the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences under fair and reasonable
conditions to legal entities that need the results to address the public emergency and commit
to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services at fair and reasonable
conditions.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. for HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Be also aware that for calls specifically addressing a public emergency, the additional
exploitation obligations may already have been activated directly in the work
programme/call conditions. In this case, there will normally not be an additional request by
the granting authority.
‘Public emergencies’ are emergencies characterised by an unexpected genuine and
sufficiently serious threat undermining EU security, public order or public health.
Examples: Public emergencies could cover events such as pandemic diseases (like Covid-19),
terrorist attacks, hacking, earthquakes, tsunamis, CBRN events, e.g. novel and highly fatal
infectious agents or biological or chemical toxins, as well as those from resulting cascading risks.
371EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The public emergency obligation is a last resort option that will only be activated if the
granting authority considers that the EU security, public order or public health cannot be
protected by any less restrictive measure.
Thus, the granting authority will for instance not request activation of the public emergency
obligation if it considers that the beneficiary is able to address the public emergency themself
and commits to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services directly or
indirectly at fair and reasonable conditions. In most cases the obligation will therefore
probably remain dormant.
In case of activation of the public emergency provision by a request of the granting authority,
the duration of the obligations and the fairness and reasonability of the licences will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the specific circumstances of the public
emergency, the context of each project and the nature of its results.
As this is an additional exploitation obligation, the beneficiary cannot OPT out and must
comply with the additional obligations if requested by the granting authority.
Best practice: If you intend to grant any exclusive licences to results that might be
concerned, you must make sure that the licensing agreement allows for an eventual
activation of the obligation (e.g. that it allows you to suspend the exclusive character and
grant licences).
Horizon Results Platform (HE) — The Horizon Results Platform (HRP) is a platform
developed by the European Commission to help promote the exploitation of the results from
the R&I framework programmes. It allows beneficiaries of grants from FP7, Horizon 2020,
Horizon Europe and Euratom to publish and promote the uptake of their results towards their
target audiences. It can be accessed by beneficiaries through the Portal.
Detailed instructions on how to publish results can be found in the IT How To > Managing
Project Results in the Horizon Results Platform.
Beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to consider the use of this free Platform to their own
benefit, at any stage of the project, during as well as after the end of the project, provided
they have key exploitable results (KER; high potential to be exploited, i.e.to be used in a
product, process or service, or act as an important input to further research, R&I related
policy or education, etc). Results such as outcomes or announcements of consortia meetings,
conferences or other events are not considered as key exploitable results and all project
deliverables are not necessarily key exploitable results either.
Publishing results in the Horizon Results Platform ensures high visibility to a variety of
potential users and stakeholders including industry, academia, investors, public
administrations, etc and may lead to finding help to exploit the results directly (e.g.
financing) or finding third parties which may be interested to exploit the results.
Example: Certain beneficiaries in a project have developed a prototype and have jointly filed for
intellectual property protection, however they do not have the capacity to bring the results to the
market. The beneficiaries concerned published their results on the Horizon Results Platform and a
company signalled its interest to use the technology in its production line. After negotiations, the
beneficiaries agreed to transfer ownership of the prototype and any attached rights to this
company in return for royalties.
The use of the Horizon Results Platform becomes mandatory, if one year after the end of
the action, key exploitable results are not exploited.
Example: Beneficiaries in a project have developed R&I policy recommendations and guidelines to
be used by public authorities in case of water pollution resulting from industrial activities. The
beneficiaries would like to see them being used but despite their best efforts they have not
managed to have local authorities use them. At the latest one year after the end of the grant, the
beneficiaries must publish the policy recommendations on the Horizon Results Platform (with the
372EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
appropriate result type = ‘policy related result’). Publishing them on HRP will provide them visibility
to policymakers from local, regional, national and EU authorities and also regulatory bodies.
However, if justified on the basis of a request of the beneficiary, the obligation to use the
Horizon Results Platform may be waived.
Examples:
1. A beneficiary is intending to exploit certain key exploitable results commercially, either
directly or indirectly, but awaits a marketing authorisation before being able to do so.
2. Two beneficiaries owning results are close to finalising an agreement with a third party to
exploit certain key exploitable results.
3. The Platform cannot be used because of the security recommendations that the project is
subject to.
Using the Platform does NOT mean that the beneficiary concerned should no longer use its best
efforts to exploit its results directly or indirectly via other means.
8. Transfers and licencing of results (HE)
Transfers of ownership:
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect
compliance with their obligations under the Agreement.
Security obligations — Transfer may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are
subject to limited disclosure/dissemination (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security).
In case of transfer, the beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations (regarding the
results) apply to the new owner and that this new owner will pass them on in any subsequent
transfer (e.g. by including this in their arrangements with the new owner).
Obligations that must be extended to new owners:
▪ Possible joint ownership obligations
▪ Protection of results
▪ Exploitation of results
▪ Transfer and licensing of results
▪ Access rights to result
▪ Dissemination of results, open science and visibility of EU funding.
When transferring ownership, they must also consider the other beneficiaries’ legitimate
interests, in particular:
− the beneficiary that intends to make the transfer must give the other beneficiaries
(that still have or still may request access rights) at least 45 days advance notice (or
less if agreed in writing; together with sufficient information to allow them to properly
assess the extent to which their access rights may be affected)
− any other beneficiary (with access rights) may object to the transfer within 30 days of
receiving notification (or less if agreed in writing), if it can show that it would
373EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
adversely affect its access rights; in this case, the transfer may not take place, until
the beneficiaries concerned reach an agreement
The mere fact that the results concerned are transferred to a competitor is NOT in itself a
valid reason for an objection. The beneficiary concerned must demonstrate the adverse
effects on the exercise of its access rights.
Example (adverse effect): Beneficiary A intends to transfer ownership of a new process it
created during the course of an action to a competitor of beneficiary B. If beneficiary B shows that
its access rights would be adversely affected by such a transfer (for instance, because the
competitor has a proven track record of systematically legally challenging beneficiary B’s claims),
the transfer may not take place until the two beneficiaries reach an agreement.
Granting licences:
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results, including on an exclusive basis, provided
this does not affect compliance with their obligations under this Agreement (e.g. they must in
particular ensure that any access rights can be exercised and that any additional exploitation
obligations are/can be complied with).
Security obligations — Licences may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are
subject to limited disclosure/dissemination (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security).
Exclusive licences (e.g. for commercial exploitation) may be granted only if all other
beneficiaries have waived their access rights and other access rights/obligations are
preserved, (e.g. the access rights of the EU, Member States or activation of the public
emergency obligation if applicable).
Specific cases (transfers and licencing of results):
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) — If a transfer of ownership is not explicit (through an
‘intended’ transfer) but part of a take-over or merger of two companies, confidentiality
constraints normally prevail (under M&A rules). Therefore, it may be necessary to inform the
other beneficiaries only after the merger/acquisition took place, instead of before.
Specifically-identified third parties — The beneficiaries may (by prior written agreement)
waive their right to object to transfers of ownership to a specifically-identified third party
(e.g. an affiliate entity of one of them). In this case, there is no need to inform them of such
transfers in advance (and they do not have the right to object).
Before agreeing to such a global authorisation, beneficiaries should carefully consider the
situation (and in particular the identity of the third party concerned), to determine if their
access rights would be affected.
Example: For large industrial groups, it is sometimes clear from the beginning that all results
produced will be transferred to another entity of the group, without being detrimental to the other
beneficiaries (who agreed to the global authorisation).
If the granting authority has the right to object to transfers, the beneficiary must formally
notify the request to waive its right to object in advance (through Portal Formal Notifications:
My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal
Notification) and the granting authority may object.
Joint research units (JRUs) — Where the internal arrangements of a JRU state that any
results produced by one member are owned jointly by all members, the JRU member that is
the beneficiary must ensure that it complies with the obligations on transfers under the Grant
Agreement (placing results under joint ownership of the JRU is a form of transfer).
374EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Common legal structures (CLS) — CLS (i.e. entities representing several other legal
entities, e.g. European Economic Interest Groupings (EEIG) or associations) that are
beneficiaries of an action may want to transfer ownership to one (or more) of their members.
This is not prohibited. However, the normal rules on transfers apply (e.g. access rights have
to remain available).
Best practice: Beneficiaries that are members of a common legal structure are strongly
advised to agree on specific arrangements with the other members of the common legal
structure, in particular relating to ownership and access rights.
Right to object to transfers or exclusive licensing — Where the work programme/call
conditions provide for the right to object, the granting authority may object to transfers or
exclusive licences (or, for Euratom grants, also non-exclusive licences) to legal entities
established in a non-associated third country if the granting authority considers that the
transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. for HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Possible grounds for objection:
▪ Planned transfer/licence not in line with EU competitiveness interests
Example: if the transfer or licence would create a major competitive disadvantage for
European companies or could make the results commercially unavailable on fair and
reasonable conditions in the EU
▪ Planned transfer/licence not consistent with ethical principles
Example: If the transfer or licence could cause the results to be used in a way that is not in
accordance with the fundamental ethical rules and principles recognised at EU and
international level
▪ Planned transfer/licence not consistent with security considerations (including, for
Euratom grants, the Member States’ defence interests under Article 24 of the
Euratom Treaty)
Example: If the transfer or licence could make results considered significant from a
security standpoint not readily available in the EU, or if security-sensitive results could fall
into the hands of third parties that are considered a security risk
▪ Planned transfer/licence weakens the EU scientific and technological bases.
Example: If the transfer or licence could weaken the EU capacity & independence in
strategic technological areas (e.g. quantum computing, artificial intelligence)
This right does NOT apply to results generated by ‘beneficiaries not having received funding
under the grant’.
The beneficiary must formally notify the granting authority in advance of any planned
transfer or exclusive licence (and, for Euratom grants, also of any non-exclusive licence)
through Portal Formal Notifications (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification).
A notification before the results are generated is allowed, if the specific results concerned
(and the details of the transfer/licence) can already be identified so an assessment can be
made.
Right to object waiver for specifically-identified third parties — A beneficiary may
formally notify (through Portal Formal Notifications: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project
375EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
> Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) a request to waive the right to
object regarding intended transfers or grants to a specifically identified third party, if
measures safeguarding EU interests are in place. If the granting authority agrees, it will
formally notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any
additional information requested).
Limitations to transfers and licensing due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy
or security reasons (restricted calls) — Where the work programme/call conditions
provide for restricted participation, prior approval by the granting authority is required
regarding any transfers or (exclusive or non-exclusive) licences to third parties which are
established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries).
9. Access rights to background & results (HE)
What & When? The beneficiaries must provide access to background and results, if it is
needed:
− by another beneficiary, for implementing action tasks or exploiting results
− by an entity established in a EU Member State or HE associated country and under the
direct or indirect control of another beneficiary, or under the same direct or indirect
control as another beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling such a beneficiary,
to exploit the results generated by that beneficiary— unless otherwise agreed or
provided for in other provisions of the Agreement.
Examples: Beneficiary A used background from beneficiary B to generate its results which is
also needed to exploit those results. Beneficiary A would like to use its entity C, a sister
company under the same control as beneficiary, established in a MS to exploit the results. For
this, entity C needs access rights to beneficiary B’s background. If entity C is established in a
Member State or an associated country, it has access rights unless otherwise provided for in the
consortium agreement. If not, the beneficiaries could agree on additional access rights (see
further below).
Other examples (restrictions) may be in relation to security related provisions or in case of
restrictions due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member
States.
There is NO definition of ‘needed’. The beneficiary owning the background or results has to
assess (on a case by case basis and taking into account the action’s specificities), if the
requesting beneficiary needs the access (and may refuse it, if it does not).
Example (results needed for implementation): If without these results, action tasks could
not be implemented, would be significantly delayed or would require significant additional
financial or human resources.
Example (background needed for exploitation): If without these results, exploiting a
result would be technically or legally impossible or if significant additional R&D work would
have to be carried out outside of the action to develop an alternative equivalent solution.
Best practice: To avoid conflicts and where appropriate, agree (e.g. in the consortium
agreement) on a common interpretation of what is needed.
However, for background there is NO (or a more limited) obligation to give access, if there
are restrictions (legal or otherwise) and the beneficiary has informed the others — before
acceding to the grant (or immediately when additional background is agreed on).
Example: A pre-existing agreement (e.g. an exclusive licence) which precludes the granting of
access rights to certain background for exploitation purposes.
By contrast, if a beneficiary contracts on background later, it must ensure that it can comply
with its access obligations under the grant.
376EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The other beneficiaries may waive their access rights, provided that such a waiver is made
in writing.
Best practice: Waivers should be made only on a case-by-case basis, once the results have
been correctly identified and it is clear that access is not needed.
How? Access rights are not automatic; they must be requested (in writing).
Best practice: Use your internal rules (e.g. consortium agreement) to specify how to make
such written requests.
Access may be requested even from beneficiaries who left the action before the end, under
the same conditions as from active beneficiaries. Similarly, if a beneficiary is no longer
involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant access.
If applicable, for entities established in a EU Member State or a HE associated country and
under the direct or indirect control, or under the same direct or indirect the same control as
another beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling such a beneficiary, access must be
requested directly from the beneficiary owning the background or results. However, the
beneficiary owning the background results may agree to a different arrangement.
Access to results for exploitation may be requested up to one year after the end of the action
— unless the beneficiaries agreed on another time limit.
The agreement by the beneficiary owning the results (on the request for access) may be in
any form (tacit, explicit, in writing or oral).
Best practice: To keep a record of entities that have access, a written agreement may be
needed, in particular for important background or results.
In case of disagreement, the requesting beneficiary can better substantiate its request,
withdraw it or resort to the conflict resolution procedures foreseen by the consortium (e.g. in
the consortium agreement). If a conflict on access rights to results is likely to affect the
action implementation, the beneficiaries must immediately inform the granting authority.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary
no longer has access rights.
Conditions for access:
Royalty free — Fair and reasonable conditions
Access to results must be given:
– for the implementation of action tasks: royalty-free
– for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions.
Examples (monetary compensation): A lump sum, a royalty percentage, or a combination
of both.
Examples (non-financial terms): A requirement to grant access to technology it has, or to
agree on cooperation in a different field or in a future project.
Best practice: In case financial terms are involved, it may not be always possible to
determine, at the moment of agreeing to these terms, what fair and reasonable financial
conditions are, since the potential value of the foreground or background and the ways of
exploitation may not be clear. Beneficiaries could in such cases opt for an open system which
allows them to take into account unexpected developments, for example by adjusting royalty
percentages in case certain milestones are reached.
377EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The conditions for access to background are slightly different. Unless restrictions apply,
access must be given:
– for the implementation of action tasks: the default rule is royalty-free
However, if agreed by the beneficiaries before the grant is signed, for background
other conditions may apply.
Example: A beneficiary owns a novel technology needed by other beneficiaries for
implementing their tasks under the action and the other beneficiaries do not bring the same
level of background. In such case the beneficiaries may agree that access to the novel
technology to implement the action will not be on a royalty-free basis.
Best practice: If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is
recommended that this is explained in detail in their proposal. Royalty fees paid for
access to background for implementation purposes may exceptionally be eligible costs
if explicitly agreed by all beneficiaries before grant signature (see Article 6.2.C.3).
– for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions.
Scope of access:
Sublicensing/Licensing — Additional access rights — More favourable terms — Additional
conditions
The access rights set out in the Grant Agreement cover only the access needed.
Access rights are a right to use by the entity concerned and do NOT automatically give the
right to the requesting beneficiary to sub-licence. (If this were the case, access rights to
results would be extended — without consent — to virtually any entity in the world, including
a beneficiary’s competitors).
Sub-licensing is only allowed if the beneficiary owning the results agrees — although such
agreement should not be unduly refused, if the sublicensing is necessary. In this case the
sub-licensing does not have to be royalty-free (even if the access rights concerned would be)
and can itself be made subject to specific conditions.
Examples:
1. A university may need the right to sub-license access to results needed to exploit its own
results to third parties, to make it possible to derive value from its own results.
2. In large industrial groups it is quite common that research is conducted by one entity and
exploitation by one or several other entities. Access rights enjoyed by the ‘research entity’ but
not by the ‘exploitation entities)’ would raise problems for those entities not covered by the
access rights for entities under the same control.
Best practice: If needed, agree on the terms and conditions of the sub-licensing generally
and in writing (in the consortium agreement or separately).
Examples: In such an agreement, they could foresee that sub-licensing could apply to the
results (or part of them), but not to the background; sub-licensing could apply to (some of the)
entities forming part of the same group , but not to (some of the) other entities.
The beneficiaries remain free to grant licences (including quasi-exclusive licences) to their
own results, as long as they can guarantee that all their grant obligations are/will be
respected, including that all access rights can be exercised. They can even grant an exclusive
licence to exploit their results, if the other beneficiaries have waived any access rights which
would make granting the exclusive licence impossible (and no additional obligations apply
with the same effect, e.g. additional exploitation/access rights obligations).
Beneficiaries are free to grant additional access rights to results, beyond the rights foreseen
in the grant if compatible with their obligations under the grant.
378EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Examples: Additional access rights for third parties (e.g. affiliated entities if they need it for
implementation purposes, entities under same control but not established in an EU Member State
or HE associated country).
Best practice: Such additional provisions may be included in the consortium agreement or in
a separate agreement.
Access may also be granted on more favourable terms (e.g. include the right to sub-licence)
or be made subject to additional conditions (e.g. appropriate confidentiality obligations).
Access rights may be exercised as long as agreed by the concerned beneficiaries (e.g. which
for patents could be until the patent expires).
Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies
and national authorities to results for policy purposes — Horizon Europe actions:
The granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies (and/or EU Member States
national authorities for Horizon Europe actions under the cluster ‘Civil security for Society’)
have specific access rights for policy purposes. Such access does not extend to beneficiaries’
background.
Access rights for the granting authority, Euratom institutions, funding bodies and
the Joint Undertaking Fusion for Energy — Euratom actions:
In Euratom actions, the granting authority, Euratom institutions, Euratom funding bodies and
the Fusion for Energy Joint Undertaking have royalty-free access, for:
− developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and programmes
− complying with Euratom’s obligations under international research and cooperation
agreements in the field of nuclear energy.
These access rights include the right to sub-license (e.g. to third parties involved in such an
international agreement) or to use the results in public procurement, as long as they are only
used for non-commercial and non-competitive purposes.
Example: Euratom is part of the ITER Agreement and is committed to disseminating information
on technological solutions developed in the context of ITER projects, and to sharing them on a
non-discriminatory basis with other ITER members and ITER itself. It does this by giving ITER and
ITER members royalty-free licences, including the right to sub-license, for the intellectual
property produced, so that they can publicly sponsor fusion and research programmes.
Additional access rights:
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional access rights, they must
also be respected and access granted.
Example: Additional access rights for the beneficiaries of linked actions.

COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION, OPEN SCIENCE AND VISIBILITY (— ARTICLE 17)
(HE)
Dissemination
Dissemination of results
The beneficiaries must disseminate their results as soon as feasible,in a publicly available format,subject to
any restrictions due to the protection of intellectual property, security rules or legitimate interests.
A beneficiary that intends to disseminate its results must give at least 15 days advance notice to the other
beneficiaries (unless agreed otherwise), together with sufficient information on the results it will disseminate.
381EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Any other beneficiary may object within (unless agreed otherwise) 15 days of receiving notification, if it can
show that its legitimate interests in relation to the results or background would be significantly harmed. In
such cases, the results may not be disseminated unless appropriate steps are taken to safeguard those
interests.
Additional dissemination obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional dissemination obligations, the beneficiaries must alsocomply
with those.
Open Science
Open science: open access to scientific publications
The beneficiaries must ensure open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to their results. In
particular, they must ensure that:
- at the latest at the time of publication, a machine-readable electronic copy of the published version
or the final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication, is deposited in a trusted repository
for scientific publications
- immediate open access is provided to the deposited publication via the repository, under the latest
available version of the Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or a
licence with equivalent rights; for monographs and other long-text formats, the licence may exclude
commercial uses and derivative works (e.g. CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND) and
- information is given via the repository about any research output or any other tools and instruments
needed to validate the conclusions of the scientific publication.
Beneficiaries (or authors) must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with the open access
requirements.
Metadata of deposited publications must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain Dedication (CC
0) or equivalent, in line with the FAIR principles (in particular machine-actionable) and provide information
at least about the following: publication (author(s), title, date of publication, publication venue); Horizon
Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and number; licensing terms; persistent identifiers
for the publication, the authors involved in the action and, if possible, for their organisations and the grant.
Where applicable, the metadata must include persistent identifiers for any research output or any other tools
and instruments needed to validate the conclusions of the publication.
Only publication fees in full open access venues for scientific publications are eligible for reimbursement.
Open science: research data management
The beneficiaries must manage the digital research data generated in the action (‘data’) responsibly, in line
with the FAIR principles and by taking all of the following actions:
- establish adata management plan (‘DMP’) (and regularly update it)
- as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP, deposit the data in a trusted repository;
if required in the call conditions,this repository must be federated in the EOSC in compliance with EOSC
requirements
- as soon as possible and withinthe deadlines set out in the DMP, ensure open access — via the repository
— to the deposited data, under the latest available version of the Creative Commons Attribution
International Public License (CC BY) or Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0) or a
licence/dedication with equivalent rights, following the principle ‘as open as possible as closed as
necessary’, unless providing open access would in particular:
- be against the beneficiary’s legitimate interests, including regarding commercial exploitation,or
- be contrary to any other constraints, in particular the EU competitive interests or the
beneficiary’s obligations under this Agreement; if open access is not provided (to some or all
data), this must be justified in the DMP
382EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- provide information via therepository about any research output or any other tools and instruments
needed to re-use or validate the data.
Metadata of deposited data must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or
equivalent (to the extent legitimate interests or constraints are safeguarded), in line with the FAIR principles
(in particular machine-actionable) and provide information at least about the following: datasets (description,
date of deposit, author(s) and embargo); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym
and number; licensing terms; persistent identifiers for the dataset, the authors involved in the action, and, if
possible, for their organisations and the grant. Where applicable, the metadata must include persistent
identifiers for related publications and other research outputs.
Open science: additional practices
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding open science practices, the beneficiaries
must also comply with those.
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding the validation of scientific publications,the
beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access to data or other results needed for validation of the
conclusions of scientific publications, to the extent that their legitimate interests or constraints are
safeguarded (and unless they already provided (open) access at publication).
Where the call conditions impose additional open science obligations in case of a public emergency, the
beneficiaries must (ifrequested by the granting authority) immediately deposit any research output in a
trusted repository and provide open access to it under a CC BY licence, a Public Domain Dedication (CC 0)
or equivalent. As an exception, if the access would be against the beneficiaries’ legitimate interests, the
beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licenses —under fair and reasonable conditions —to legal entities that
need the research output to address the public emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the
resulting products and services at fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after
the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities
Unless excluded by the call conditions, the beneficiaries must provide and regularly update a plan for the
exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities.
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules for communication, dissemination and visibility (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules regarding communication and dissemination activities.
Most programmes use the standard set of additional rules concerning the communication and
dissemination plan and the additional communication activities. Some programmes (HE,
RFCS, DEP) use more customised provisions.
2. Communication and dissemination plan (some programmes)
Programmes that need more detailed information about the communication strategy followed
by the action, have a provision obliging the beneficiaries to provide their full communication
plan (— in addition to the key elements that already need to be part of each proposal/DoA
Annex 1).
383EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For more guidance and communication best practices, see Communicating about your EU-
funded project and the HE Social Media Guide.
3. Special logos (some programmes)
In principle, for 2021-2027, all programmes follow the corporate EU visual identity, meaning
that there are in principle no longer any programme-specific logos. There are however
exceptions for some programmes (e.g. CREA Media, LIFE, HUMA, UCPM). Also, Grant
Agreements of EU funding bodies (such as for instance the EU joint undertakings) will keep
using their own logos (in addition to the EU logo) and will require their use by the projects.
4. Limited communication and visibility to protect persons involved (some
programmes)
Some programmes (especially those active in conflicts and crises, like HUMA and RELEX), will
limit communication and visibility options in order to protect the persons working on the
ground. In these cases, the consortium may propose to the granting authority alternative
arrangement.
5. Dissemination (HE)
Unless it goes against their legitimate interests, the beneficiaries must — as soon as feasible,
but not before a decision on their possible protection — disseminate their results, i.e. make
them public.
Security obligations — Dissemination may be restricted/NOT possible for results that
are subject to security rules (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
Results that are disclosed too early (before the decision on their protection) may run the risk
of making protection impossible.
Example: If a result is disclosed (in writing (including by e-mail) or orally (e.g. at a conference)
before filing for patent protection — even to a single person who is not bound by secrecy or
confidentiality obligations (typically someone from an organisation outside the consortium) this
may invalidate a subsequent patent application.
NO dissemination at all may take place, if:
− the results in question need to be protected as a trade secret (i.e. confidential know-
how) or
− dissemination conflicts with any other obligations under the grant (e.g. personal data
protection, security obligations, etc).
The beneficiaries may choose the appropriate publicly available format for disseminating their
results.
Standard forms of dissemination:
▪ website
▪ presentation at a scientific conference, at an education and training event or other
events with stakeholders and potential users of the results
▪ peer-reviewed publication
The dissemination measures should be consistent with the plan for the exploitation and
dissemination of the results (see below) and proportionate to the impact expected from the
action.
384EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
When deciding on dissemination, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’
legitimate interests.
The beneficiary that intends to disseminate must give the other beneficiaries at least 15 days
advance notice (together with sufficient information on the intended dissemination) — unless
otherwise agreed.
Any other beneficiary may object to dissemination — unless otherwise agreed — within 15
days of receiving notification, if it can show that it would suffer significant harm (in relation to
its background or results). In this case, the results may not be disseminated — unless
appropriate steps are taken to safeguard the interests at stake.
Examples (significant harm): Disseminating the results would lead to disclosure of valuable
background held by another beneficiary as a trade secret or would make protecting another
beneficiary’s results more difficult. Appropriate steps could include: omitting certain data or
postponing dissemination until the results are protected.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should provide for arrangements (either in the consortium
agreement or in separate agreements) to ensure that decisions on dissemination take due
account of the interests of all beneficiaries concerned and yet allow for publication of results
without unreasonable delay. This may include a specific mechanism to resolve any disputes
as soon as possible.
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional dissemination obligations,
those obligations must also be complied with/fulfilled.
Example: Requirement to disseminate the results in a specific website.
6. Open science (HE)
‘Open science’ is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of
knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the research process.
The open science provisions in Horizon Europe contain a set of requirements and encouraged
practices that cover some of the most important aspects of open science. They concern
research outputs such as scientific publications and research data and additional open
science practices .
‘Research outputs’ are results to which online access can be given in the form of scientific
publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes, such as software,
algorithms, protocols, models, workflows and electronic notebooks.
6. Open science: Open access to scientific publications (HE)
Beneficiaries must ensure open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to
their results. This includes articles and long-text formats, such as monographs and other
types of books. Immediate open access is required i.e. at the same time as the first
publication, through a trusted repository using specific open licences.
‘Peer review’ is the assessment of manuscripts or publications by researchers with relevant
expertise.
An article is considered to be peer-reviewed when it has been scrutinized and approved by
expert researchers. The number of the positive assessments required is set by each
publishing venue.
Long-text formats — such as books/monographs and edited volumes — are considered to be
peer-reviewed if the manuscript (or a substantial part thereof) has been reviewed at least by
one independent expert external to the publisher or to the series scientific editor(s). PhD
theses and habitations for professorial degrees are considered peer-reviewed, if they are
385EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
formally published through a publisher. Book chapters are NOT considered long-text formats
but are treated similarly to articles.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open access to ALL publications, even
if they are not peer-reviewed.
How to provide open access:
Beneficiaries/authors may publish in the venue of their choice, either in a closed venue (i.e.
access to all content is restricted), an open access publishing venue or in a hybrid publishing
venue, provided that all their open access-related obligations as detailed in this section are
complied with.
‘Open access publishing venues’ are publishing venues whose entire scholarly content is
published in open access (e.g. open access journals, books, publishing platforms, repositories
or preprint servers).
‘Hybrid publishing venues’ are publishing venues which provide part of their scholarly content
in open access, while another part is accessible through subscriptions/payments (e.g. hybrid
journals and books). These are often journals/books based on subscription/purchase which
provide open access to part of their content when an open access fee is paid by their
authors/institutions (paid ad hoc or on the basis of an institutional agreement with the
publishers).
‘Mirror and sister journals’ (i.e. more recently established open access versions of existing
subscription journals, which may share the same editorial board as the original journal and
usually have (at least initially) the same or very similar aims, scope and peer review
processes and policies; these journals often have a name similar to the subscription title but
a different ISSN) are considered open access publishing venues for Horizon Europe grants
(not hybrid journals).
In parallel, beneficiaries/authors must deposit their publication in a machine-readable format
(i.e. structured format that can automatically be read and processed by a computer) in a
trusted repository — before or at publication time — and immediately provide open access to
the publication through that repository.
Publishing in an open access venue without depositing in a repository, does NOT comply
with the open access requirements. All peer-reviewed publications must be deposited in
trusted repositories and open access provided to them through the repositories.
When choosing the publishing venue and the repository, beneficiaries/authors must keep in
mind that licensing requirements, metadata requirements and validation requirements must
also be complied with at this time.
The European Commission offers Horizon Europe beneficiaries Open Research Europe
(ORE), an open access publishing platform with no publishing fees. ORE is offered as
an additional publishing option to Horizon Europe beneficiaries. When ORE is the selected
publishing venue, all requirements for open access to scientific publications are automatically
fulfilled, as ORE deposits publications in the all-purpose repository Zenodo under the
conditions required by Horizon Europe.
Immediate open access through the repository must be provided either to the final peer-
reviewed manuscript accepted for publication or to the final published peer-reviewed version.
Please also note that publication fees are only eligible when publishing in full open access
publishing venues (venues in which the entire scholarly content is openly accessible to all)
and not in hybrid venues. Publication fees may, in particular, include peer review fees,
including where the peer review service has been provided by an organisation different from
386EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
the one providing the publishing venue. Peer review fees for publications are eligible for
reimbursement only for the first round of peer reviewers.
Publishing fees (including page charges or colour charges) for publications in other
venues, for example in subscription journals (including hybrid journals) or in books that
contain some scholarly content that is open and some that is closed are NOT eligible costs.
Publishing fees for open access books may be eligible to the extent that they cover the
first digital open access edition of the book (which could include different formats such as
html, pdf, epub, etc).
Printing fees for monographs and other books are NOT eligible.
Repository requirements:
Beneficiaries must ensure deposition of and open access to publications (and research data,
where the case) through trusted repositories.
‘Repositories’ are online archives, where researchers can deposit digital research outputs and
provide (open) access to them.
Repositories help manage and provide access to scientific outputs and contribute to the long-
term preservation of digital assets.
They can be institutional, operating with the purpose to collect, disseminate and preserve
digital research outputs of individual research organisations (institutional repositories, e.g.
the repository of University X) or domain-specific, operating to support specific research
communities and supported/endorsed by them (e.g. Europe PMC for life sciences including
biomedicine and health or arXiv for physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative
biology, quantitative finance and statistics; Phonogrammarchiv for audio-visual recordings
the CLARIN-DK-UCPH Repository for digital language data or the European Nucleotide Archive
or databases of astronomical observations operated by the European Southern Observatory,
among others). There are also general-purpose repositories, such as for example Zenodo,
developed by CERN.
Personal websites and databases, publisher websites, as well as cloud storage services
(Dropbox, Google drive, etc) are NOT considered repositories. Academia.edu, ResearchGate
and similar platforms do not allow open access under the terms required and therefore are
also NOT considered repositories.
Trusted repositories can be grouped into three categories which may overlap:
− certified repositories, such as those certified by international organisations or
government-authorised certification bodies (e.g. CoreTrustSeal, nestor Seal
DIN31644, ISO16363)
− disciplinary or domain repositories commonly used and endorsed by the research
communities, and which are recognised internationally
− general-purpose repositories, institutional repositories or any other repositories that
present the essential characteristics of trusted repositories, i.e.:
− display specific characteristics of organisational, technical and procedural quality,
such as services, mechanisms and/or provisions that are intended to secure the
integrity and authenticity of their contents, thus facilitating their use and re-use
in the short- and long-term. Trusted repositories have specific provisions in place
and offer explicit information online about their policies, which define their
services (e.g. acquisition, access, security of content, long-term sustainability of
service including funding, etc)
387EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− provide broad, equitable and ideally open access to content free at the point of
use, as appropriate, and respect applicable legal and ethical limitations. They
assign persistent unique identifiers to contents (e.g. DOIs, handles, etc), such
that the contents (publications, data and other research outputs) are
unequivocally referenced and thus citeable. They ensure that contents are
accompanied by metadata sufficiently detailed and of sufficiently high quality to
enable discovery, reuse and citation and contain information about provenance
and licensing. Their metadata is machine-actionable and standardized (e.g.
Dublin Core, Data Cite, etc) preferably using common non-proprietary formats
and following the standards of the respective community the repository serves,
where applicable
− facilitate mid- and long-term preservation of the deposited material. They have
mechanisms or provisions for expert curation and quality assurance for the
accuracy and integrity of datasets and metadata, as well as procedures to liaise
with depositors where issues are detected. They meet generally accepted
international and national criteria for security to prevent unauthorized access
and release of content and have different levels of security, depending on the
sensitivity of the data being deposited, to maintain privacy and confidentiality.
Licensing requirements and IPR:
Scientific publications must be licensed under the latest available version of a Creative
Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or an equivalent licence. For
monographs and other long-text formats the licence may exclude commercial uses and
derivative works (as in CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND or CC BY-NC-ND or equivalent licences).
For more guidance, including an explanatory checklist of the rights conferred by the above
licences that will help researchers to understand publisher-equivalent licences, see the HE
Programme Guide.
Beneficiaries (or authors, where the case) must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to
be able to comply with their open access requirements.
The obligation to ensure open access under the conditions set out in the Grant Agreement
precedes any subsequent publishing agreement and is therefore a prior obligation with
respect to such agreements.
Best practice: Beneficiaries/authors retain the copyright on their work and grant, insofar as
possible, non-exclusive licences to publishers. To facilitate this, beneficiaries should put in
place institutional policies to ensure copyright retention by authors and/or beneficiaries and
compliance with the open access requirements.
To help you find publishing venues that comply with Horizon Europe open access
requirements, you can use:
- the Journal Checker Tool — can help to determine whether a specific publishing venue
allows compliance with the open access obligations of Horizon Europe
- the Directory of Open Access Journals — can help to identify full open access journals
that allow open access publishing under CC BY or an equivalent licence
- Open Research Europe — open access publishing platform of the European
Commission, allows automatic compliance with the Horizon Europe requirements.
Validation requirements:
Information must be given via the repository (or via the copy of the publication deposited in
the repository) about any research output or any other tools and instruments needed to
388EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
validate the conclusions of the scientific publication. Research outputs, tools and instruments
may include data, software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks
and others. Information should include a detailed description of the research
output/tool/instrument, how to access it, any dependencies on commercial products,
potential version/type, potential parameters, etc.
Best practice: It is recommended that open access is provided to these research outputs,
tools and instruments — unless legitimate interests or constraints apply.
Metadata requirements:
Metadata should be in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
principles. In particular, it should be machine-actionable (i.e. machine-readable, and
automatic computer processing can extract information from the metadata attributes
ensuring a cross-linking between different research outputs) and follow a standardised
format, in line with community standards, and should provide rich information on the
publication/data (author(s), publication title, date of publication, publication venue); Horizon
Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and number; licensing terms.
Additionally, metadata must be open access under a Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication (CC0) or equivalent, ensuring its reusability.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or a handle) must
be provided for the peer-reviewed version of the publication in the first publishing venue
(e.g. journal, book, publishing platform); where the peer-reviewed version has been
published in a preprint server or a repository as first publishing venue, the PID of that
version has to be provided. PIDs also have to be provided for all author(s) involved in the
action (such as ORCIDs or ResearcherIDs) and, if possible, for their organisations (such as
ROR IDs) and the grant (such as grant DOIs).
Best practice: It is recommended that researchers apply these requirements for metadata to
digital research outputs, including data and other tools and instruments identified as
necessary to validate publications.
Visibility, acknowledgment of EU support and disclaimers:
Scientific publications must also acknowledge the EU support and display the European flag
(emblem) and funding statement in line with the provisions set out in Article 17 and, where
applicable, the special logos set out in Annex 5 (see specific rules below).
Best practice: In addition to the metadata requirements, in order to facilitate the
identification of your action and follow-up by the granting authority and your
readers/audience, it is recommended to include, within the text of your publication, specific
information on the grant (e.g. project name, acronym, grant agreement number, and/or your
project's digital object identifier (project DOI)).
7. Open science: Research data management (HE)
Beneficiaries must manage responsibly the digital research data generated in the action
(‘data’) in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. They
should also ensure open access to research data via a trusted repository under the principle
‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.
Generated data also includes re-used data that have been processed or modified in a
systematic or methodical way.
The requirements for research data management apply only to data that are generated in the
course of the action. Beneficiaries should also consider re-used data when developing their
389EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
data management plans (DMPs), if they form part of their research and to the extent
possible.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to manage research outputs other than
publications and research data also in line with the FAIR principles and to adequately describe
relevant efforts in the DMP. Other research outputs may include software, algorithms, code,
protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks among others.
How to meet the research data management and open access requirements:
Beneficiaries must do the following to meet the requirements:
− establish a data management plan (DMP), addressing important aspects of research
data management
AND
− deposit the data in a trusted repository and ensure open access through the
repository, as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP.
Data management plan
Beneficiaries must submit a DMP as a mandatory project deliverable (normally within 6
months after grant signature). An updated DMP deliverable must then be produced mid-
project (for projects longer than twelve months) and at the end of the project (where
relevant).
The ‘data management plan (DMP)’ is a document that outlines from the start of the project
the main aspects of the lifecycle of research outputs, notably including data. This includes
their provenance, organisation and curation, as well as adequate provisions for their access,
preservation, sharing, and eventual deletion, both during and after a project.
Writing a DMP is an activity directly linked to the methodology of the research, i.e. good data
management will make the work more efficient/save time, contribute to safeguarding
information and to increasing the impact and the value of the data among the beneficiaries
and others, during and after the research.
Beneficiaries should maintain the DMP as a living document and update it over the course of
the project whenever significant changes arise. This includes (but is not limited to) the
generation of new data, changes in data access provisions or curation policies, attainment of
tasks (e.g. datasets deposited in a repository, etc), changes in relevant practices (e.g. new
innovation potential, decision to file for a patent), changes in consortium composition.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to encode their DMP deliverables as non-
restricted, public deliverables, unless there are reasons (legitimate interests or other
constraints) not to do so. In the case they are made public, it is also recommended that open
access is provided under a CC BY licence to allow a broad re-use.
For more guidance on research data management and making research data FAIR, and for a
DMP template, see the HE Programme Guide.
De posit and ensure open access through trusted repository
The data must be deposited in a trusted repository, ensuring open access via the repository,
as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP.
The deposition of the data must take place as soon as possible after data
production/generation or after adequate processing and quality control have taken place,
providing value and context to the data and at the latest by the end of the project.
390EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This does not entail that data must be made open, but rather that it is deposited so that
metadata information is available and hence information about the data is findable. In
exceptional cases in which specific constraints apply (e.g. security rules), deposition can be
delayed beyond the end of the project.
Best practice: It is recommended to maintain data available for a substantial period — at
least five years, and preferably 10 years or even longer — according to specific needs and/or
disciplinary deposition practices, in line with the recommendations of the European Code of
Conduct for Research Integrity.
The data includes raw data, to the extent technically feasible, but especially if it is crucial to
enable re-analysis, reproducibility and/or data re-use.
Data underpinning a scientific publication should be deposited at the latest at the time of
publication, and in line with standard community practices.
For calls with a condition relating to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), data must be
deposited in trusted repositories that are federated in the EOSC in compliance with the EOSC
requirements. A list of the services offered by EOSC, including for storage and processing of
research data, can be found on the EOSC Portal.
Open access is required as the default for research data under the principle ‘as open as
possible, as closed as necessary’. This means that, as an exception, beneficiaries may or
must keep certain data closed for justified reasons; they must explain in the DMP the
exception(s) under which they choose to (or must) restrict access to some (or all) of the
research data.
Acceptable exceptions are: if providing open access is against the beneficiary’s legitimate
interests, including regarding commercial exploitation; if it is contrary to any other
constraints, such as data protection rules, privacy, confidentiality, trade secrets, EU
competitive interests, security rules, intellectual property rights or would be against other
obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples (valid justification):
1. Data which is commercially valuable may be kept closed if making the data open would
undermine the exploitation of the data or other results (such as could endanger trade secrets) or
make IP protection of results more difficult.
2. Data protection/privacy rules may mean that certain (sensitive) personal data cannot be made
open.
3. Security rules may also require closed data. In projects relating to the strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the Union, data should to be kept closed if making the data open
would put in jeopardy those objectives.
Licensing requirements:
Research data in open access must be licensed under the latest available version of a
Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) requiring attribution of
authorship, or a licence providing equivalent rights, or under a Creative Commons Public
Domain Dedication (CC0) or equivalent (which waives any rights to the data). The latter may
be appropriate in particular for large datasets that can be more easily re-used without
restrictions, or in any other case if authors so desire. A Creative Commons Public Domain
Mark (PDM) or equivalent should be applied to raw research data, unless the data meet the
requirements to be protected by copyright/database right.
Requirements for the re-use and validation of data:
Information must be given via the repository about any research output or any other tools
and instruments needed for the re-use or validation of research data. Research outputs, tools
and instruments may include data, software, algorithms, code, protocols, models, workflows,
electronic notebooks and others. Information must include a detailed description of the
391EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
research output/tool/instrument, how to access it, any dependencies on commercial
products, potential version/type, potential parameters, etc.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open access to these research outputs,
tools and instruments — unless legitimate interests or constraints apply.
Metadata requirements:
Metadata should be in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
principles. In particular, it should be machine-actionable (i.e. machine-readable, and
automatic computer processing can extract information from the metadata attributes
ensuring a cross-linking between different research outputs) and follow a standardised
format, in line with community standards, and should provide rich information on the data
(author(s), dataset description, date of dataset deposit, dataset deposit venue and dataset
embargo (if any)); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and
number; licensing terms.
Additionally, metadata must be open access under a Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication (CC0) or equivalent, to the extent that legitimate interests are safeguarded and
constraints are taken into account.
In cases where data is closed but there are no compelling reasons that the related metadata
should not be findable and accessible, it is recommended that open access is provided to the
metadata of the data, with CC0 public domain dedication or equivalent, if possible, while the
dataset itself remains closed.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) must be provided for the dataset (such as a Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) or a handle), for all author(s) involved in the action (such as ORCIDs or
ResearcherIDs) and, if possible, for their organisations (such as ROR IDs) and the grant
(such as grant DOIs).
All the above provisions regarding research data management are also recommended for
research outputs other than scientific publications and research data.
Beneficiaries (or researchers, where the case) should retain sufficient intellectual property
rights to comply with the research data management requirements and to follow the research
output management recommendations.
8. Open science: Additional open science practices (HE)
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional obligations regarding open
science practices, those obligations must also be complied with.
Such open science practices can include, where relevant, early and open sharing of research
(for example, through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, or crowd-sourcing);
research output management (beyond publications and data); measures to ensure
reproducibility of research outputs; providing open access to research outputs beyond
publications and research data (for example software, models, algorithms, and workflows);
participation in open peer-review; and involving all relevant knowledge actors including
citizens, civil society and end users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as
citizen science).
Specific cases (open science):
Additional obligations regarding validation of scientific publications — If provided for
in the work programme/call conditions, beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access
to data or other results needed for the validation of the conclusions of scientific publications,
to the extent that their legitimate interests are safeguarded and constraints are taken into
account (for example through agreements with relevant confidentiality provisions) and unless
they already provided the (open) access at the time of publication.
392EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Additional obligations regarding open science in public emergencies — If the public
emergency provisions apply and can be activated on request of the granting authority (see
above for more explanations on additional exploitation obligations in case of public
emergencies), the requirement regarding immediate open access is extended beyond
publications, i.e. to any research outputs as follows:
− Beneficiaries must immediately deposit any research output in a repository and
provide open access to it under the latest version of a CC BY licence or having
released it via a Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or equivalent. Immediate means
that deposition of the research outputs must take place as soon as feasible, taking
into consideration the urgent nature of public emergencies and the care for the public
good.
− As an exception, if providing open access would be against their legitimate interests,
the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable
conditions — to legal entities that need the research output to address the public
emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and
services on fair and reasonable conditions. This obligation will apply for a period of
time specified in the request and up to four years after the end of the action. The
duration of this obligation and the fairness and reasonability of the licences will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the specific circumstances of the
public emergency, the context of each project and the nature of its results.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
In addition to the requirements regarding data management plans (DMPs) outlined above, in
the case of a public emergency for which the granting authority has activated the provision
by a request made at the stage of the work programme/call conditions, the beneficiaries
should provide a DMP preferably with the proposal or at the latest before grant signature.
The work programme/call conditions may provide for additional obligations in this regard.
For more guidance on open science practices and how to incorporate them in the action see the
HE Programme Guide.
9. Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication
activities
Unless the work programme/call conditions explicitly state otherwise, proposals must include
a first version of the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including
communication activities. A more detailed plan will then need to be provided as mandatory
project deliverable (normally within 6 months after grant signature).
The ‘plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities’
is a document that details the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that
will be carried out in the project to achieve the expected impact.
All measures described in the plan should be proportionate to the scale of the project, and
should contain concrete actions to be implemented. Where relevant (and in particular for HE
Innovation Actions), the measures should describe a plausible path to commercialise the
393EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
innovations. If exploitation is expected primarily in non-associated third countries, justify by
explaining how that exploitation is still in the EU interest.
This plan must be updated as required under the Grant Agreement (at least once before the
end of the project), in alignment with the project’s progress. Changes on the dissemination,
exploitation and communication activities can be introduced through the Portal Continuous
Reporting tool. The last version of the plan before the end of the project must include the
dissemination and exploitation activities that the beneficiaries plan to implement in a period
up to 4 years after the end the project.
During that period, beneficiaries must continue reporting on the progress of their activities
and on the project results through the Portal Continuous Reporting tool, which will remain
accessible.

1. Specific rules for carrying out the action (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules for carrying out the actions.
Some of these additional rules are standardised (i.e. based on a similar text, e.g. specific
rules for public procurement actions, specific rules for financial support to third parties
(FSTP), specific rules for blending operations, etc). Others are completely customised and
programme-specific (e.g. specific rules for humanitarian aid operations (HUMA), specific rules
for ESF actions (ESF), specific rules for information and promotion campaigns for agricultural
products (AGRIP)).

Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security, the beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated
partners, [third parties giving in-kind contributions,] subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third
parties are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) —unless
otherwise agreed with the granting authority.The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation
with entities established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect
the strategic assets, interests, autonomy or securityof the EU and its Member States.
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-

1. Specific rules for the participation in case of restrictions due to strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States (restricted
calls) (HE)
Where the work programme/call conditions restrict participation due to strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security (so-called ‘restricted calls’), the beneficiaries must ensure
that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners,
subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) are established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or,
if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless
otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
If applicable (and unless the work programme/call conditions provide otherwise),
beneficiaries should provide the necessary justification why the involvement of such entities
is needed. Thus, if already known at the time of submission, the proposals must clearly
indicate that they will involve such entities, i.e. identify (if possible) the entities concerned
and justify why their involvement is needed.
The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation with entities established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or,
if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect
the strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States. This
includes but is not limited to cooperations that could negatively impact the protection and
exploitation of the results.

Recruitment and working conditions for researchers
The beneficiaries must take all measures to implement the principles set out in Annex II to the Council
Recommendation on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial
talents in Europe60 (from now on ‘the European Charter for Researchers’), in particular regarding:
- working conditions
- transparent recruitment processes based on merit, and
- career development.
The beneficiaries must ensure that researchers and all participants involved in the action are aware of them.

According to these rules, the beneficiaries must take all measures to implement the principles
set out in the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for their
Recruitment55.
The Charter provides a framework for researchers’ activities and career management, and
includes obligations for researchers, employers and funders. The Code of Conduct provides
for transparency to the recruitment and selection process, ensuring the equal treatment of all
applicants. It includes obligations for employers and funders.
55 Commission Recommendation 2005/251/EC of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on
a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75/67 , 22.3.2005, p. 67).
397EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific
steps to address conflicts between their policies and practices and the principles set out in the
European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken and measures put in place (see Article 20).
The granting authority will verify compliance with this obligation, when monitoring the action
implementation and in case of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 25).
The beneficiaries must in particular implement the general principles and requirements from
that relate to recruitment, working conditions and career development.
List of principles (relating to recruitment):
▪ Recruitment
▪ Transparency
▪ Judging merit
▪ Selection
▪ Variations in the chronological order of CVs
▪ Recognition of mobility experience
▪ Recognition of qualifications
▪ Seniority
▪ Postdoctoral appointments
List of principles (relating to working conditions):
▪ Research freedom
▪ Accountability
▪ Non-discrimination
▪ Working conditions
▪ Research environment
▪ Funding and salaries (in particular, adequate social security)
▪ Stability and permanence of employment
▪ Gender balance
▪ Intellectual property rights
▪ Complaints/appeals and
▪ Participation in decision-making bodies.
List of principles (relating to career development):
▪ Career development
▪ Access to research training and continuous development (independently of the
researcher’s status)
398EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Value of mobility
▪ Access to career advice
▪ Supervision
▪ Evaluation/appraisal systems.
The principles relating to recruitments imply that beneficiaries should have a clear policy for
recruiting and selecting researchers, which is publicly available and ensures that:
− all research vacancies and funding opportunities are publicly advertised (e.g. via the
EURAXESS Jobs Portal56)
− vacancies and funding opportunities are also published in English
− vacancy announcements include a clear job description
− vacancy announcements include the requirements for the position or the funding
opportunity, and the selection criteria
− there is an appropriate time period left between publication and the deadline for
applications
− there are clear rules for the composition of the selection panels (e.g. number and role
of members, inclusion of experts from other (foreign) institutions, gender balance)
− adequate feedback is given to applicants
− there is a complaint mechanism
− the selection criteria adequately value mobility, qualifications and experience,
including qualifications and experience obtained in non-standard or informal ways.
These principles also apply to selection procedures that do not lead to formal employment
relationship (e.g. award of a research fellowship).

conduct research and foster innovation in their fields. This definition includes the associated
human resources, and it covers major equipment or sets of instruments; knowledge-related
facilities such as collections, archives or scientific data infrastructures; computing systems,
communication networks, and any other infrastructure, of a unique nature and open to
external users, essential to achieve excellence in research and innovation. Where relevant,
they may be used beyond research, for example for education or public services, and they
may be ‘single-sited’, ‘virtual’ or ‘distributed’61:
When implementing access to research infrastructure activities, the beneficiaries must respect the following
conditions:
- for transnational access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, transnational access to research infrastructure or
installations for selected user-groups.
The access must include the logistical, technological and scientific support and the specific
training that is usually provided to external researchers using the infrastructure.
Transnational access can be either in person (hands-on), provided to selected users that visit
the installation to make use of it, or remote, through the provision to selected user-groups of
remote scientific services (e.g. provision of reference materials or samples, remote access to
a high-performance computing facility).
- categories of users that may have access:
Transnational access must be provided to selected user-groups, i.e. teams of one or more
researchers (users).
The majority of the users must work in a country other than the country(ies) where the
installation is located (unless access is provided by an international organisation, the Joint
Research Centre (JRC), an ERIC or similar legal entity).
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they have generated under the
action may benefit from the access (unless the users are working for SMEs).
Access for user groups with a majority ofusers not working in a EU Member State or
Horizon Europe associated countryis limited to 20% of the total amount of units of access
provided under the grant (unless a higher percentage is foreseen in Annex 1).
- procedure and criteria for selecting user groups:
The user groups must request access by submitting (in writing) a description of the work
that they wish to carry out and the names, nationalities and home institutions of the users.
The user groups must be selected by (one or more) selection panels set up by the
consortium.
The selection panels must be composed of international experts in the field, at least half of
them independent from the consortium (unless otherwise specified in Annex 1).
The selection panels must assess all proposals received and recommend a short-list of the
user groups that should benefit from access.
The selection panels must base their selection on scientific merit, taking into account that
priority should be given to user groups composed of users who:
61 See Article 2(1) of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme Regulation 2021/695.
400EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- have not previously used the installation and
- are working in countries where no equivalent research infrastructure exist.
It will apply the principles of transparency, fairness and impartiality.
Where the call conditions impose additional rules for the selection of user groups,the
beneficiaries must also comply with those.
- other conditions:
The beneficiaries must request written approval from the granting authority for the selection
of user groups requiring visits to the installations exceeding 3 months (unless such visits are
foreseen in Annex 1).
In addition, the beneficiaries must:
- advertise widely, including on a their websites, the access offered under the Agreement
- promote equal opportunities in advertising the access and take into account the gender
dimension when defining the support provided to users
- ensure that users comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement
- ensure that its obligations under Articles 12, 13, 17 and 33 also apply to the users
- keep records of the names, nationalities, and home institutions of users, as well as the
nature and quantity of access provided to them
- for virtual access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, virtual access to research infrastructure or installations.
‘Virtual access’ means open and free access through communication networks to digital
resources and services needed for research, without selecting the users to whom access is
provided.
The access must include the support that is usually provided to external users.
Where allowed by the call conditions, beneficiaries may in justified cases define objective
eligibility criteria (e.g. affiliation to a research or academic institution) for specific users.
- other conditions:
The beneficiaries must have the virtual access services assessed periodically by a board
composed of international experts in the field, at least half of whom must be independent from
the consortium (unless otherwise specified in Annex 1). For this purpose, information and
statistics on the users and the nature and quantity of the access provided, must be made
available to the board.
The beneficiaries must advertise widely, including on a dedicated website, the access offered
under the grant and the eligibility criteria, if any.
Where the call conditions impose additional traceability62 obligations, information on the
traceability of the users and the nature and quantity of access must be provided by the
beneficiaries.
These obligations apply regardless of the form of funding or budget categories used to declare the costs (unit
costs or actual costs or a combination of the two).]
62 According to the definition given in ISO 9000, i.e.: “Traceability is the ability to trace the history, application, use and
location of an item or its characteristics through recorded identification data.”The users can be traced, for example, by
authentication and/or by authorization or by other means that allows for analysis of the type of users and the nature and quantity
of access provided.
401EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities (HE)
The specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities apply to Horizon Europe
actions involving transnational and/or virtual access to research infrastructure for scientific
communities (in particular calls under Part III of the HE Work Programme, ‘Research
infrastructures’).
The specific rules in Annex 5 apply independently of the cost form chosen by the
beneficiary (unit cost or actual cost; see Article 6.2.D.3 and 6.2.D.4).
2. Transnational access to research infrastructure (HE)
Grants including this type of activity usually reimburse — for the provision of transnational
access — the following types of costs:
− ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the research infrastructure or installation and
costs related to logistical, technological and scientific support for users, including ad-
hoc user training and the preparatory and closing activities needed to use the
installation)
− ‘users’ travel and subsistence costs
− costs of advertising the transnational access offered under the action
− costs related to the selection procedure (e.g. the selection panel members’ travel and
subsistence costs, logistical costs of meetings, fees, etc.)
− costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the
periodic technical reports. For this purpose, beneficiaries should keep records of the
names, nationalities and home institutions of users, as well as the nature and quantity
of access provided to them.
‘Installation’ means a part or a service of a research infrastructure that could be used
independently from the rest. A research infrastructure consists of one or more installations.
The access costs (first indent) may be declared as unit costs, actual costs or — under certain
conditions — as a combination of the two (see HE RI authorising decision57), while the other
costs in this list (users’ travel and subsistence, advertisement, selection, reporting, etc) must
be declared as actual costs (see Article 6).
If the access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget
category 6.2.D.3 Transnational access to research infrastructure unit costs. They must fulfil
the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for that budget category (see
Article 6.2.D.3).
If they are declared as actual costs, they must be declared under the other budget categories
(see Article 6). They must fulfil the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for
57 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
402EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
the type of cost in question (e.g. costs for other goods and services must also fulfil the
specific eligibility conditions for the cost category C.3 Other goods, works and services).
Capital investments (i.e. equipment costs for renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable
equipment, infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed , unless provided for in the
work programme/call conditions (see also Article 6.2.D.3).
Transnational access must be measured (in ‘units of access’).
The units of access for the various installations must be specified in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. A unit of access will always be specified for each installation (regardless whether
the access costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs).
Examples (units of access): Per beam-hour for a synchrotron; per night for a telescope; per
number of frozen embryos for a mouse repository; per week of access for a historical archive; per
campaign-day for a research vessel.
Detailed information on the provision of access activity must be described in the periodic
technical reports.
Record-keeping — The beneficiaries must keep appropriate records and supporting
documentation to justify the number of units of transnational access for which they declare costs,
including:
− users’ names, nationalities and home institutions
− the nature and quantity of access and provided to them
− the number of units of access provided.
This information must be included in the periodic reports to the granting authority.
3. Transnational access which must be provided (HE)
Transnational access can be either:
− in person (hands-on), provided to selected users that visit the installation or
− remote, through the provision to selected users of remote scientific services.
Remote transnational access requires competitive selection of the users to be served under
the Grant Agreement, since it always applies to resources that are not unlimited (e.g.
computing hours on a supercomputer or remote analysis of a sample). It is thus different
from virtual access, for which selection of users is NOT required.
Examples (remote access): provision of reference materials or samples (e.g. shipping of a virus
strain); performing a remote sample analysis or sample deposition; remote access to a high-
performance computing facility.
Transnational access must be given to selected user groups (free of charge).
4. Categories of users that may have transnational access — Limited access for
special user groups (HE)
For transnational access, the majority of the users, in a user team applying for access, must
work in a country other than the country(ies) where the installation is located (— unless
access is provided by an international organisation, the European Commission Joint Research
Centre (JRC), a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) or similar legal entity
with international membership).
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they will generate under the
action may benefit from the access (— unless the users are working for SMEs).
403EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
User groups in which all or most users work in non-associated third countries may ONLY
have access for up to 20 % of the total number of units of access provided under the grant.
The consortium should itself define whether this 20% limit is uniformly applied to the
different installations or some installations may be used more than others. This should be
done in the consortium agreement.
Specific cases (transnational access to research infrastructure):
Distributed research infrastructure — In the case of distributed research infrastructures,
the exemption for the user origin/location applies to ALL installations providing services under
the umbrella of the research infrastructure (e.g. the ERIC), even if owned/operated by a
different legal entity (e.g. local/national node of an ERIC). In this case, all concerned
installations must be clearly listed in the proposal as being part of the same research
infrastructure benefitting from the exemption (e.g. the ERIC) and the distributed research
infrastructure (e.g. ERIC) must be a beneficiary. Beneficiaries must keep evidence that the
access to these installations or to their services are part of the offer of the distributed
infrastructure (e.g. service level agreements, other agreements).
With regard to related installations operated by another legal entity (e.g. local/national node
of an ERIC), this legal entity participate as:
- an affiliated entity to the research infrastructure
- another beneficiary if also carrying out other tasks in the project not under the
umbrella of the research infrastructure
- a third party to which the research infrastructure is purchasing access services
excluding any profit margin (see Article 6.2.C)
- a third party providing in-kind contributions free of charge
depending on the statutes of the research infrastructure, the agreements with its
nodes, the expected level of use of the concerned installations and any other relevant
implementation aspects.
5. Selection procedure with a selection panel (transnational access) (HE)
For transnational access, access providers must set up a common selection panel that
regularly evaluates the applications for access and recommends a shortlist of the user groups
that will benefit from access.
If justified, access providers may use several different selection sub-panels.
Example: Different thematic selection sub-panels could be set up for a set of analytical facilities
serving multidisciplinary communities.
6. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to users — Controls,
impact evaluation (transnational access) (HE)
The beneficiaries must ensure that users comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant
Agreement.
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are respected by the
users (e.g. through the agreement for the use of the research infrastructure, i.e. Terms and
conditions for use).
They cover in particular the obligations regarding controls and assessment. Thus, the
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA)
and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits
404EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
and investigations on the users (see Article 25), and in particular to audit proper
implementation of action tasks. If access is denied by the user, the costs will be rejected.
They must also ensure that the granting authority has the right to make an evaluation of the
impact of the action under Article 26.
7. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to users — Conflicts of
interest, confidentiality, visibility, liability (transnational access) (HE)
For transnational access, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the users comply with
certain other obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Obligations that must be extended to users:
▪ Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13)
▪ Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17)
▪ Liability for damages (see Article 33).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
users.
8. Virtual access to research infrastructure (HE)
Virtual access applies to digital resources and services needed for research that are available
through communication networks.
Grants including this type of activity usually reimburse — for the provision of virtual access—
the following types of costs:
− ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the installation during the course of the
action and costs related to technological and scientific support for users access (e.g. a
helpdesk)
− costs of advertising virtual access offered under the action
− costs related to the assessment carried out by the board of international experts (e.g.
costs of organising a board meeting)
− costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the
periodic technical reports and the assessment report (see below point 3).
The access costs (first indent) may be declared as unit costs, actual costs or — under certain
conditions — as a combination of the two (see HE RI authorising decision58), while the other
costs in this list (users’ travel and subsistence, advertisement, selection, reporting, etc) must
be declared as actual costs (see Article 6).
If the access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget
category 6.2.D.4 Virtual access to research infrastructure unit costs. They must fulfil the
general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for that budget category (see Article
6.2.D.4).
58 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
405EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If they are declared as actual costs, they must be declared under the other budget categories
(see Article 6). They must fulfil the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for
the type of cost in question (e.g. costs for other goods and services must also fulfil the
specific eligibility conditions for the cost category C.3 Other goods, works and services).
Capital investments (i.e. costs of renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable equipment,
infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed, unless provided for in the work
programme/call conditions (see also Article 6.2.D.4). In this case only the portion used to
provide virtual access under the project is eligible.
Virtual access must be measured (in ‘units of access’).
The units of access for the various installations be specified in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. A unit of access will always be specified for each installation (regardless whether
the access costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs).
When allowed by the call conditions and in well justified cases, the grant proposal can also
define objective eligibility criteria (e.g. affiliation to a research or academic institution) for the
users to whom access will be provided under the grant.
Detailed information on the provision of access activity must be described in the periodic
technical reports, including statistics on all users in the reporting period compiled through
web analytical tools.
9. Virtual access which must be provided (HE)
Since virtual access applies to digital resources and services available through communication
networks (i.e. resources that are unlimited available), the users do NOT have to undergo a
formalised selection procedure (this, together with the transnationality of users, is the main
difference between virtual and transnational access).
Access provided must be free of charge for users.
Example: Access to a database available on the internet.
10. Periodic assessment by a board of international experts (virtual access) (HE)
For virtual access, the access services must be regularly assessed by a board of international
experts, at least half of whom must be independent from the consortium (unless otherwise
specified in Annex 1).
At least two assessments are usually carried out during the course of an action.
The assessment reports must already be foreseen in the proposal (as deliverables; see HE RI
application form) and be included in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement.
406EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Annex 5 > HE PCP and PPI procurements
Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements (HE)
[OPTION for HE PCP-PPI: Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements
When implementing procurements in Pre-commercial Procurement (PCP) or Public Procurement of Innovative
Solution (PPI) actions,the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination,
equal treatment, sound financial management,proportionality and competition rules
- assign the ownership of the intellectual property rights under the contracts to the contractors (for PPI
procurements: unless there are exceptional overriding public interests which are duly justified in
Annex 1), with the right of the buyers to access results —on a royalty-free basis—for their own use
and to grant (or to require the contractors to grant) non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the
results for them —under fair and reasonable conditions —without any right to sub-license
- allow for all communications to be made in English (and any additional languages chosen by the
beneficiaries)
- ensure that prior information notices, contract notices and contract award notices contain information
on the EU funding and a disclaimer that the EU is not participating as contracting authority in the
procurement
- allow for the award of multiple procurement contracts within the same procedure (multiple sourcing)
- for procurements involving classified information: apply the security rules set outin Annex 5 mutatis
mutandis to the contractors and the background and results of the contracts
- where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons: apply the restrictions set out in Annex 5 mutatis mutandis to the contractors and the
results under the contracts
- where the call conditions impose a place of performance obligation: ensure that the part of the
activities that is subject to the place of performance obligation is performed in the eligible countries or
target countries set out in the call conditions
- to ensure reciprocal level of market access: where the WTO Government Procurement Agreement
(GPA) does not apply, ensure that the participation in tendering procedures is open onequal terms to
bidders from EU Member States and all countries with which the EU has an agreement in the field of
public procurement under the conditions laid down in that agreement, including all Horizon Europe
associated countries. Where the WTO GPA applies, ensure that tendering procedures are also open to
bidders from states that have ratified this agreement, under the conditions laid down therein. ]
1. Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements (HE)
These specific provisions apply to HE PCP and PPI types of action (i.e. calls with PCP/PPI
ToA).
They summarise the key requirements from General Annex H of the HE Work Programme for
the beneficiaries that are part of the buyers group (procurers).
407EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Formally speaking, the Annex 5 provisions apply ONLY for calls that run as PCP/PPI type
of action (i.e. where also the specific cost category in Article 6.2.D.5 applies).
Other types of calls (RIA, IA, CSA, etc) are NOT subject to Annex 5 (nor to Article
6.2.D.5) —even if projects should include PCP or PPI activities. For them, the PCP/PPI
activities must be handled as subcontracting in accordance with Article 6.2.B and Article
9.3.
However, for BOTH groups, the detailed provisions in General Annex H of the HE Work
Programme apply. If you plan to implement PCP or PPI activities in a Horizon Europe action,
you should therefore always first look at the General Annex.
2. Conflict of interest (HE)
The beneficiaries must avoid potential conflicts of interest in the preparation and
implementation of PCP/PPI procurements.
‘Conflict of interests’ means any situation where the impartial and objective implementation
of the Agreement could be compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life, political
or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect interest (see Article 12).
Therefore, entities that could have a potential conflict of interest with the PCP/PPI
procurement should in principle NOT be involved in the EU grant.
Thus, for instance potential providers of solutions can NOT participate as beneficiaries,
affiliated entities or associated partners in the EU grant. They can also NOT be used as
external experts, consultants or subcontractors for tasks to help prepare and/or manage the
PCP/PPI procurement (e.g. tasks for preparing the open market consultation and/or tender
specifications, evaluation of tenders, management of the procurement procedure).
Entities that are not potential providers, but which represent such providers (e.g. industry /
research associations or funding agencies, standardisation fora / bodies) can participate but
must take specific measures to ensure avoidance of conflict of interest. They must, for
instance, ensure that:
− the activities are performed in an impartial, independent way by their own staff (not
by staff of the providers)
− any interactions with providers are done in a non-discriminatory way (ensuring equal
treatment of ‘all’ providers, without giving any preferential treatment to those
providers that are represented by the entity).
3. Transparency — Communications in English — Equal treatment and non-
discrimination of tenderers and providers (HE)
The beneficiaries must comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and
equal treatment.
The transparency requirements apply both before, during and after the end of the PCP/PPI
procurement. They aim to ensure that all potentially interested providers are informed well
in advance to be able to make an offer and to disseminate the results of the PCP/PPI
procurement in line with the Horizon Europe policy on dissemination.
The public procurers must, in particular:
− publish prior information notices for the open market consultation (PINs), contract
notices and contract award notices in the OJEU (TED)
408EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− at the end of the PCP/PPI tender evaluation (for PCP, also for each phase) provide to
the granting authority:
− information on the total number of bids received, winning tenderer(s) and
abstracts of their project(s) (template) — public deliverable; will be published by
the granting authority
− final ranking list of the selected projects, final scores and qualitative assessment
per criterion for each bid received, minutes of the evaluation meeting — non-
public deliverable
− at the end of the action:
− give a demonstration to the granting authority of the tested solutions (PCP),
respectively the deployed innovative solution(s) (PPI)
− assessment by the procurers of the results achieved by each tenderer (for PCPs,
also after each phase) (template) — public deliverable; will be published by the
granting authority
Additional requirements for the PINs, contract notice and contract award notices (including
timing and exceptions) are set out in the General Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
Regarding deadlines for publication of notices, we will consider as the ‘date of publication’ the
date when you submitted the notice to the OJEU Publication Office.
In order to foster wide participation of potential providers from across Europe, the
procurement procedure must be done at least in English. In addition to English, you can also
choose to allow other languages.
This obligation applies not only to the language(s) used by the public procurers for
publication of the PINs, contract notice and contract award notice, the tender specifications
and contracts, but also to the language(s) that tenderers are allowed to use for the
submission of questions and offers.
Additional transparency requirements (including timing and exceptions) are set out in General
Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
The beneficiaries must ensure non-discrimination and equal treatment of all tenderers,
throughout the preparation and implementation of the procurement.
They must pay particular attention to:
− keep market consultations open to all tenderers
− evaluate all offers according to the same objective criteria, regardless of the
geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of the tenderers
It is therefore NOT possible to restrict the access or give preferential access to:
− tenderers from your specific country, region or city
− startups or SME type solution providers
− tenderers with a specific governance structure (e.g. stock listed vs non-stocklisted
companies, foundations, NGOs, research organisations, etc).
− not to provide information in a discriminatory manner that may give some
tenderers/providers an advantage over others
409EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− not to reveal confidential information communicated by a tenderer/provider without
their explicit agreement.
This can be ensured by including appropriate provisions for communication and
confidentiality of information in the open market consultation and call for tender
documents.
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
4. Intellectual property rights (HE)
Results generated by the beneficiaries follow the standard rules on IPR in Article 16 and
Annex 5.
For results generated by PCP/PPI procurement providers, the ownership of the IPR must
be assigned to the providers (for PPI procurements: unless there are exceptional overriding
public interests which are duly justified in the DoA Annex 1).
For PCP procurements, the beneficiaries must reserve the rights to:
− enjoy royalty-free access rights to the R&D results for their own use
− grant themselves (or to require the providers to grant) non-exclusive licences to third
parties, to exploit the results for them under fair and reasonable market conditions,
without any right to sub-license
This right serves as a safeguard to ensure continuity of service and a competitive
supply chain (during or after the action). It does NOT mean that every PCP provider
will always and automatically be obliged to grant licences to third parties to exploit the
results.
Example (licences needed): Other providers working for the procurers need access to the
IPR to work for the procurers. A PCP provider abuses its monopoly situation in the
commercialisation of products resulting from the PCP and, in order to ensure a competitive
supply chain, the procurers need another provider on the market to be able to supply them the
products.
The right is only allocated to the procurers (not to third parties directly) and only
applies to cases when licensing to third parties is needed to exploit the results ‘for the
procurers’ (not for other potential customers). Therefore, the provision does NOT give
competitors of the PCP providers any rights to require the procurers and/or PCP
providers to grant them licences to exploit the results. The provision also does NOT
give the procurers any rights to grant (or require the PCP providers to grant) licences
to third parties to exploit the results for ‘other markets’ beyond the procurers. The
licensing must ensure also that the PCP provider is financially compensated under fair
and reasonable market conditions.
− require the provider to transfer ownership of the results to them, if the provider uses
the results to the detriment of the public interest (including security interests) or fails
to commercially exploit the results within a given period after the PCP as fixed in the
PCP contract (call back provision)
This right serves as a safeguard to prevent abuse of results and ensure commercial
exploitation of results in the public interest, in case the PCP providers fail to do so
themselves. It can be exercised after consultation with the PCP on the reasons for why
this happened. By obtaining the IPR ownership, the public procurers can ensure
410EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
commercial exploitation of the results in line with the public interest. It will be for
exceptional cases.
Example (call-back needed): A PCP provider is winding up its business or decides to stop the
production line that commercialises the PCP results. A PCP provider abuses security related
results, for example to hack public services.
− to publish public summaries of the results of the PCP procurement, including
information about key R&D results attained and lessons learnt (e.g. on the feasibility
of the solution approaches to meet the requirements and lessons learnt for potential
future deployment of solutions).
Details that would be contrary to the public interest, would harm legitimate business
interests (e.g. regarding IPR-protected specificities of their individual approaches to
solutions) or could distort fair competition may not be disclosed.
To see what is normally published, see the templates for PCP-PPI Contractor details
and abstracts and End of phase and end of project results and conclusions for PCP-
PPI.
This allows to optimise the conditions for the PCP providers to pursue wide exploitation of
results and for the procurers to use the results without supplier lock-in, while ensuring that
the PCP procurement complies with the conditions for its exemption from the EU Public
Procurement Directives and from the international procurement agreements between the EU
and third countries.
If additional exploitation obligations apply, the beneficiaries must moreover ensure that the
PCP/PPI procurement call for tender documents comply with these obligations.
Example:
1. Due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions may require
that PCP/PPI providers commercialise the majority of the results in EU Member States.
2. Due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions may restrict
the participation to the action to entities that are established in (and controlled from) EU Member
States. Annex 5, stipulates that in the case, the beneficiaries (in particular the procurers carrying out
the PCP/PPI) as well as the PCP/PPI providers may NOT transfer ownership of their results or grant
licences to third parties which are not established (and, if applicable, are not controlled from) EU
Member States — unless they have requested and received prior approval by the granting authority.
Finally, for all PCP/PPI procurements, the allocation of the IPR to the providers must be
factored into the tender price. This will allow to obtain the best value for money price
according to market conditions (and rule out State aid).
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
5. Multiple sourcing (HE)
For PCP procurements, the use of multiple sourcing is obligatory, because pre-commercial
is per definition a procurement approach that awards multiple procurement contracts for R&D
services to multiple tenderers within the same procedure, in order to compare and test
potential alternative solution approaches from different providers in parallel.
For PPI procurements, the use of multiple sourcing is optional, unless the call conditions
explicitly require it. Although multiple sourcing requires higher upfront investment from the
buyers in terms of procurement budget and effort needed to monitor the contracts, multiple
sourcing can be useful for the deployment of solutions in PPIs for a number of reasons:
411EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− security reasons: multiple sourcing can be needed to guarantee the required security
levels and assurances in the supply of goods or services
− security of supply: multiple sourcing removes the dependency on only one supplier to
deliver all solutions and can guarantee that there is at all times security of supply of
sufficient solutions. This may be vital where a steady, reliable supply of
products/services is needed but the supply chain is fragile and the risk is too big to
rely on one supplier only to deliver all required solutions (e.g. supply of COVID
vaccines)
− strategic autonomy: multiple sourcing can reduce the dependency on non-European
providers for example by awarding the same contracts to both European and non-
European providers. This can be vital in situations of geopolitical tensions or
uncertainty
− continuity of service: solution/technology redundancy guarantees that if one solution
of one provider crashes/fails, another can immediately take over
Example: Since so many public services run these days on digital networks, ICT networks
typically install nodes from different competing providers and load balancing ensures that if
there is a technical failure in nodes from one provider, nodes from other providers that are
implemented differently can immediately take over the task and there is no service disruption.
− complementarity of solutions: when none of the solutions of different providers works
on its own in all circumstances, and the simultaneous deployment of different
solutions from different providers is needed to cover all the possible situations that
may occur
Example: If a harbour wants to track goods across the full supply route, solutions based on
sensors, camera’s, optical scanners, satellite images can all detect movement of goods in
different situations, but none of them covers all situations (indoor versus outdoor, short versus
long range, high versus low accuracy). If there is no provider on the market with and end-to-
end solution that can address all situations and requirements, the best way forward may be to
buy and install simultaneously different solutions that use alternative technologies from
different providers.
− better value for money: by awarding the same contract to multiple providers, the level
of competition is maximised. If the performance of one of the providers drops
significantly, the public buyer will immediately notice and there is no hurdle for him to
switch immediately to one of the other providers. If the performance of one provider
significantly increases, the buyer can immediately ask the other providers why they
are not performing at the same level. This competition can incentivize providers to
continue to improve their level of performance and reduce their prices over time in
order to remain among the best of the pack.
6. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to providers — Security
related obligations (HE)
Actions that involve security issues must apply the security rules set out in Annex 5 mutatis
mutandis to the PCP/PPI procurement providers, the background and results of the
PCP/PPI contracts.
These security rules will impact the preparation and implementation of the PCP/PPI. The
procurers must ensure that the whole process (market consultation, preparation of the tender
documents, evaluation of tenders, award and performance of the contracts) respects the
security rules.
For PCP/PPIs involving classified information, the beneficiaries need to ensure that
throughout the whole process all involved staff on the side of the participating providers,
subcontractors and procurers and other involved beneficiaries have the required security
412EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
clearances, and that all communications and deliverables are submitted and handled
according to the applicable rules for handling classified information.
In addition, the security rules may impact the procurement procedures in terms of limiting
the information that be disclosed (both in terms of IPR, deliverables of the procurement,
dissemination activities), limiting the providers that can participate (both to the market
consultation and the call for tenders) and limiting the allowed subcontracting. All these
aspects require also prior written explicit approval of the EU granting authority.
PCPs/PPIs involving dual-use goods or dangerous materials and substances must comply with
applicable EU, national and international law on handling these items, and the procurers must
ensure that PCP/PPI providers deliver them the required export or transfer licences.
In case the Grant Agreement includes security recommendations that affect the PCP/PPI
procurement, the beneficiaries must ensure that the open market consultation and tender
documents comply with the recommendation.
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
7. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to providers — Restrictions
on participation and/or control (HE)
If, due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions restrict
the participation to beneficiaries that are established in (and controlled from) eligible
countries, for example EU Member States only, , only procurers established in (and controlled
from) EU Member States are allowed to carry out the PCP/PPI procurement. Procurers
established in (and controlled from) third countries are NOT allowed to participate in the
action.
For such calls, the beneficiaries must apply the restrictions also to the contractors. For this,
the procurers must ensure that the PCP/PPI call for tender documents restrict participation to
bidders/providers established in the eligible countries. Other bidders/providers cannot
participate.
Example: Due to security reasons, the call conditions may require that the participation to the PPI
grants under the call is restricted to procurers from EU Member States (e.g. because the call
concerns solutions with potentially security sensitive products/solutions. The buyers group must
then incorporate provisions in its PPI call for tender documents that ensure that for the lots of the
PPI procurement that are concerned (i.e. involve the deployment of security sensitive
products/solution components), the participation is limited to bidders/providers that are
established in and controlled from EU Member States. For lots that are not concerned (i.e. do not
involve the deployment of security sensitive products/solution components), the participation
should remain open to providers from all countries with which the EU has an international
agreement on public procurement under the conditions provided by that agreement.
8. Place of performance obligation (HE)
Where the call conditions impose a place of performance obligation, the beneficiaries must
ensure that the part of the PCP/PPI procurement activities that is subject to the place of
performance obligation is performed (by the providers and their subcontractors) in the
eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions
413EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For PCP, a more general minimum condition regarding place of performance is also
set out in the General Annex H of the HE Work Programme, i.e. that the majority (i.e. at
least 50%) of the activities performed for the PCP contract as well as the principle R&D
staff must be located in EU Member States or HE associated countries.
The ‘activities performed for the PCP contract’ include R&D and operational activities (e.g.
research, development, testing, certifying solutions, etc).
The ‘principal R&D staff’ are the main researchers, developers and testers responsible for
leading the R&D activities covered by the contract.
For PPI, the minimum condition doesn’t apply since PPI procurements are typically
subject to the WTO GPA and other international procurement agreements.
Example (PCP): For projects in the field of security, the call conditions may specific for example
that 100% of the R&D work performed for the PCP contract on security components of the solution
as well as all the principle R&D staff working on security components must be located in the EU
Member States. The EU Member States are then the target countries for this additional place of
performance obligation. The procurers in the action must then ensure that their PCP call for tender
documents include not only the minimum place of performance obligation but also include the above
additional place of performance obligation. This will ensure that PCP providers and their
subcontractors implement minimum 50 % of all activities — including the non-security activities — of
the PCP in the EU Member States and HE associated countries and 100% of the R&D work for the
security components of the solution in the EU Member States.
Example (PPI): For projects in the field of security, the call conditions may specific for example
that 100% of the work for the PPI contract must be performed — and all the staff working on the PPI
contract must be located — in the EU Member States (or even in certain specific EU Member States).
The EU Member States listed in this obligation are then the target countries of this place of
performance obligation.
If a place of performance obligation applies, the beneficiaries must require PCP/PPI providers
to comply with it, including when they subcontract work.
The PCP/PPI call for tender documents and the procurement contract must clearly set out this
obligation and must require that it is passed on to subcontractors.
9. Market access for bidders from non EU countries — WTO GPA — International
agreements on public procurement (HE)
To ensure reciprocal level of market access, beneficiaries must ensure that where the WTO
Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) does not apply, the participation in tendering
procedures is open on equal terms to bidders from EU Member States and all countries with
which the EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement under the conditions laid
down in that agreement, including all HE associated countries. Where the WTO GPA applies,
ensure that tendering procedures are also open to bidders from states that have ratified this
agreement, under the conditions laid down therein.
PCP procurements are generally exempt from the WTO GPA and all other agreements on
public procurement between the EU and third countries because they are for R&D services
contracts (i.e. contracts with the objective to provide R&D services). Access to PCP
procurements can therefore be limited to PCP providers from the EU Member States and HE
associated countries (— and even restricted further in case of restricted calls due to strategic
assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons).
PPI procurements are generally not exempt from the WTO GPA and the other agreements
on public procurement between the EU and third countries. Access to PPI procurements must
therefore normally be open also to tenderers from third countries that are parties to the WTO
GPA or with whom the EU has an agreement on public procurement, under the conditions
specified in those agreements (— except for calls that are restricted due to strategic assets,
414EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
interests, autonomy or security reasons, provided that the restriction also falls under a
specific exemption in those agreements, e.g. exemptions for public security and public
health).
International agreements on public procurement usually also contain non-discrimination
obligations. Country of origin and other local content restrictions are thus only allowed in
PCP/PPI procurements if they fall under an exception/exemption of these agreements (e.g.
for PCPs: all PCPs are exempted, for PPIs: only limited exemptions exist, e.g. for security and
public health).
Example:
1. Due to the exceptional situation on public health created by the corona pandemic, COVID-19
vaccine procurement contracts may currently contain provisions requiring that vaccine production
takes place in the EU Member States and that essential components are sourced from the EU
Member States.
2. Due to exemptions for the utilities sector, public buyers in the utilities sector can reject tenders
for supply contracts when more than 50% of the products come from third countries with which the
EU does not have an international (WTO GPA or bilateral) agreement on public procurement.
3. Due to the exemption for PCP procurements, PCP procurements can require that essential
components for developing, testing and commercialising the solution are sourced from the EU
Member States and the countries associated to Horizon Europe as well as that the PCP providers
locate minimum 50% of the production of products and/or the provisioning of services that result
from the PCP in the EU Member States and the countries associated to Horizon Europe. If required,
e.g. due to security or public health reasons, this requirement could be restricted to EU Member
States.

and PPI grants, HE Programme Guide > Innovation Procurement and General Annexes B and H of
the HE Work Programme.
415EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Annex 5 > HE Co-funded partnerships
Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships (HE)
[OPTION for HE and Euratom Programme Cofund actions: Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships
When implementing financial support to third parties in Co-funded Partnerships, the beneficiaries must respect
the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and
sound financial management
- for the types of activity and categories of persons that will be supported:
- for multi-beneficiary projects (including multi-participant projects): the projects supported
must be transnational, involving at least two independent legal entities from two different EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries as recipients of the financial support
and may also include legal entities established in a non-associated third countries not
receiving financial support
- for mono-beneficiary projects (multi-participant projects): the projects supported must be
transnational, involving one legal entity established in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe associated country as recipient of the financial support and one legal entity
established in a non-associated third country not receiving financial support
- for the selection procedure and criteria:
- publish open calls widely (including on the Funding & Tenders Portal and the beneficiaries’
websites)
- keep open calls open for at least two months
- inform recipients of call updates (if any) and the outcome of the call (list of selected projects,
amounts and names of selected recipients)
- measures to avoid potential conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants must be
ensured (notably through appropriate communication/exchange of information channels and
independent and fair complaints procedures)
- use the following selection criteria: the standard Horizon Europe award criteria
- use the following selection procedures:
- projects must be selected following a joint transnational call for proposals
- beneficiaries must make the selection through a two-step procedure:
- Step 1: review at national or transnational level (including national
eligibility checks)
- Step 2: single international peer review
and in Step 2:
- proposals must be evaluated with the assistance of at least three independent
experts
- proposals must be ranked according to the evaluation results and the
selection must be made on the basis of this ranking
- the selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer,
who must make a report.
416EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Where the financial support is implemented through implementing partners, the beneficiaries must:
- ensure that the partners comply with the same rules, standards and procedures for implementing the
financial support
- implement effective monitoring and oversight arrangements towards the partners, covering all aspects
relating to the action
- ensure effective and reliable reporting by the partners, covering the activities implemented,
information on indicators, as well as the legality and regularity of the expenditure claimed
- ensure that the partnersprovide that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF,
Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the final recipients
- where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons: apply the restrictions set out in Annex 5 mutatis mutandis to the final recipients and
their results.]
1. Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships (HE)
The specific rules (such as the participation of beneficiaries/affiliated entities as recipients of
FSTP) for Co-funded Partnerships apply to certain HE Programme Co-fund types of action
(i.e. calls with COFUND ToA). They replace the former Joint programming initiatives (JPIs),
European research area networks (ERA-NETs) and European Joint programmes (EJPs) Cofund
actions in Horizon 2020.
The Annex 5 provisions focus ONLY on the cascading scenario (i.e. where beneficiaries
provide financial support to third parties (FSTP); so-called ‘co-funded calls’). For
transnational projects implemented by the beneficiaries themselves (as part of the action),
the standard rules of the Grant Agreement apply.
Co-funded Partnerships are ALSO subject to the rules for recipients of financial support
(FSTP) in Article 9.4.
2. Providing financial support vs implementation of transnational projects by the
beneficiaries (HE)
A core part of Co-funded Partnerships is to provide financial support to third parties (i.e. pass
on the EU support they receive via the Co-funded Partnerships grant to recipients that are
not party to the Grant Agreement, also called ‘cascade funding’).
In this case, the beneficiaries’ activity consists in providing the financial support, while it is
the final recipients (‘third parties receiving financial support’) that actually implement the
projects.
Specific cases (co-funded partnerships):
FSTP between beneficiaries — Beneficiaries to the EU grant can in principle NOT also be
final recipient (since that is not the purpose of a cascading grant).
However, if explicitly permitted by the call conditions/Grant Agreement and included and
justified in the DoA Annex 1, there are cases where exceptions are permitted (i.e. where the
co-funded call can be opened also for entities that are also beneficiaries of the EU grant or
417EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
other departments of the beneficiary). In this case, the consortium will be asked during grant
preparation to:
- -propose a clear list of beneficiaries (or which department of a beneficiary, where
applicable) that will have the responsibility of drafting call texts, and managing the
award procedure
- -identify the beneficiaries (or other departments of the same beneficiary) which can
apply for funding under the co-funded call for proposals
- -explain the measures to mitigate (potential) conflict of interest or unequal treatment
of applicants (see information barriers below) and
- -reflect this fully in their DoA Annex 1, both in the context of the description of the co-
funded call and in relation to the monitoring of the transnational projects.
If needed, beneficiaries must set up information barriers (‘firewalls’) to prevent exchanges or
communication that could lead to conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants and
ensure independent and fair complaints procedures.
Costs can be declared ONLY by the beneficiary providing the financial support, NOT by the
final recipient receiving the financial support (even if it is at the same time beneficiary of the
grant and can therefore declare other costs).
3. Calls for transnational projects (HE)
The projects financed under the co-funded calls must be transnational, i.e. for Horizon co-
funded partnerships, they must involve:
− for multi-beneficiary projects (including multi-participant projects): at least two
independent legal entities from two different EU Member States or HE associated
countries which implement the project receiving financial support; in addition the
projects may also include legal entities from non-associated third countries not
receiving any financial support from the EU grant
OR
− for mono-beneficiary projects (multi-participant projects): one legal entity from an EU
Member State or HE associated country which implements the project with financial
support; in addition, to ensure their transnational nature, the projects must include at
least one legal entity established in a non-associated third country not receiving any
financial support from the EU grant.
Note that additional eligibility conditions may apply in specific cases concerning the minimum
number of independent entities (including entities from third countries).
For Euratom Co-funded Partnerships, references to ‘associated countries’ must be understood
as Euratom associated countries (not HE associated countries).
4. Award criteria (HE)
The evaluation in the co-funded calls must be done on the basis of the same award criteria
that are used for Horizon Europe calls, i.e.:
(a) Excellence
(b) Impact
(c) Quality and efficiency of the implementation.
418EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The aspects to be taken into account for each award criterion should also be the same used
for Horizon Europe proposals. Depending on the type of action, General Annex D of the HE
Work Programme should be applied.
5. Two-step selection procedure (HE)
The selection procedure of the co-funded calls must follow a two-step procedure, ensuring
for:
Step 1: review at national or transnational level (including national eligibility checks)
Step 2: single international peer review
and that in Step 2:
– proposals must be evaluated with the assistance of at least three independent
experts
– proposals must be ranked according to the evaluation results and the selection
must be made on the basis of this ranking
– the selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer, who
must make a report.
Only entities/consortia that are eligible for funding under BOTH Horizon Europe rules and
national funding rules should be invited to Step 2.
The co-funded calls and projects must in principle comply BOTH with the applicable
Horizon Europe and with the national funding rules of the beneficiaries.
Best practice: Where possible, the beneficiaries are however encouraged to harmonise the
national rules and implementation modalities for their transnational calls (e.g. by using only
Horizon Europe rules as common rules).
Consortia should be allowed to adjust the budget between Steps 1 and 2, in order to balance
the requested funding and available funding per participating EU Member State and HE
associated country.
6. Independent experts — Observers (HE)
In addition to using expert evaluators for the evaluation of the co-funded calls, the
beneficiaries must appoint, for each call, an independent expert as an observer to verify that
the selection procedure meets the requirements (in particular, for the peer review evaluation
and the ranking).
The observer’s report must be submitted by the coordinator, as part of the periodic report
(see Article 21.2).
7. Ranking list — Joint selection list (HE)
The beneficiaries must base their selection (joint selection list) on the order of the ranking list
(or the ranking lists, if there are different topics).
If proposals have identical scores, the proposals coming from participating EU Member States
or HE associated countries with still available funding can be given precedence, in order to
maximise the number of selected projects.
The ranking list(s) and the joint selection list must be submitted by the coordinator, as part
of the periodic report (see Article 21.2).
419EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
8. Project implementation — Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement
to final recipients (HE)
The implementation of the transnational projects by final recipients will follow in principle the
rules of the cascade grant agreements they sign with the beneficiaries (e.g. usually national
rules, but they can also decide to use Horizon Europe rules as common rules for those
agreements).
In all cases, the beneficiaries must ensure that the users comply with certain obligations from
the EU grant (see Article 9.4).
Obligations that must be extended to recipients:
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding as appropriate (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18)
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are respected by the final
recipients (e.g. through the cascade grant agreement).
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
recipients, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
recipient, the costs will be rejected.

General > Annex 5 > HE ERC Grants
Specific rules for ERC Grants (HE)
[OPTION for HE ERC Grants: Specific rules for ERC Grants
When implementing ERC Grants, the beneficiaries must ensure that the action tasks described in Annex 1 are
performed under the guidance of the principal investigator.
In accordance with Article 21, beneficiaries must submit progress reports (scientific reports) and periodic
reports according to the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Points 4.1 and 4.2). Reports
must be prepared using the templates available in the Portal (ERC scientific and periodic reports).
The internal arrangements set out in Article 7 must cover the decision making procedures for scientific and
grant management issues, the distribution of the EU contribution, internal dispute settlement and division of
responsibilities for cases of rejection of costs or reduction of the grant.
In addition to the obligations set out in Article 17, communication and dissemination activities as well as
infrastructure, equipment or major results funded by the grant mustmoreover display the following special
logo:
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions for the principal investigator and their
team:
- host and engage the principal investigator for the whole duration of the action
- take all measures to implement the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers — in
particular regarding working conditions, transparent recruitment processes based on merit and career
development — and ensure that the principal investigator, researchers and third parties involved in the
action are aware of them
- enter — before grant signature — into a Supplementary Agreement with the principal investigator,
that specifies:
- the obligation of the beneficiary to meet its obligations under the Grant Agreement
- the obligation of the principal investigator to supervise the scientific and technological
implementation of the action
- the obligation of the principal investigator to assume the responsibility for the scientific
reporting for the beneficiary and contribute to the periodic reporting
- the obligation of the principal investigator to meet the time commitments for implementing
the action and for working in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe associated country, as
set out in Annex 1
- the obligation of the principal investigator to apply the beneficiary’s usual management
practices
421EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- the obligation of the principal investigator to inform the beneficiary immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect the Grant Agreement, such as:
- a planned portability of the grant (or part of it) to a new beneficiary (see Articles 32.2,
39, 40, 41)
- any personal grounds affecting the implementation of the action
- any changes in the information that was used as a basis for signing the supplementary
agreement
- any changes in the information that was used as a basis for awarding the grant
- the obligation of the principal investigator to ensure the visibility of EU funding in
communications or publications and in applications for the protection of results (see Article
16 and 17)
- the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights — during the implementation of
the action and afterwards —, in particular, the obligation of the principal investigator to
uphold the intellectual property rights of the beneficiary and full access — on a royalty-free
basis — for the principal investigator to background and results needed for their activities
under the action
- the obligation of the principal investigator to maintain confidentiality (see Article 13)
- for portability of the grant to a new beneficiary (see Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41):
- the right of the principal investigator to request the portability of the grant, provided that
the objectives of the action remain achievable
- the obligation of the principal investigator to:
- propose to the coordinator (in writing) to what extent the action will be transferred
and the details of the transfer arrangement
- provide a statement to the coordinator with the detailed results of the research up to
the time of transfer
- the right of the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court of
Auditors (ECA), etc.) to exercise their rights also towards the principal investigator
- the applicable law and the dispute settlement forum
- provide the principal investigator with a copy of the signed Agreement
- guarantee the principal investigator scientific independence, in particular for the:
- use of the budget to achieve the scientific objectives
- authority to publish as senior author and invite as co-authors those who have contributed
substantially to the work
- preparation of scientific reports for the action
- selection and supervision of the other team members, in line with the profiles needed to
conduct the research and in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual management practices
- possibility to apply independently for funding
- access to appropriate space and facilities for conducting the research
- provide — during the implementation of the action — research support to the principal investigator
and the team members (regarding infrastructure, equipment, access rights, products and other
services necessary for conducting the research)
- support the principal investigator and provide administrative assistance, in particular for the:
- general management of the work and their team
- scientific reporting, especially ensuring that the team members send their scientific results
to the principal investigator
422EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- periodic reporting, especially providing timely and clear financial information (for actual
costs)
- application of the beneficiary’s usual management practices
- general logistics of the action
- access to the electronic exchange system
- inform the principal investigator immediately (in writing) of any events or circumstances likely to
affect the Agreement
- ensure that the principal investigator enjoys adequate:
- conditions for annual, sickness and parental leave
- occupational health and safety standards
- insurance under the general social security scheme, such as pension rights
- allow (for both mono and multi-beneficiary actions) the portability of the grant to a new beneficiary,
if requested by the principal investigator and provided that the objectives of the action remain
achievable (see Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41). The beneficiary may object only on the basis that the
portability of the grant is not possible under national law. In particular, the beneficiary must:
- agree with the principal investigator and the new beneficiary on a plan for the transfer of the
intellectual property rights under the Agreement to the new beneficiary
- transfer to the new beneficiary any part of the pre-financing received which is not covered by
an approved periodic report, if requested by the granting authority
- transfer to the new beneficiary the equipment purchased and used exclusively for the action
— against reimbursement of the costs that have not yet been depreciated (for actual cost
grants) or under fair and reasonable conditions agreed among the concerned beneficiaries (for
lump sum grants) — if requested by the principal investigator and the granting authority, and
unless the transfer is not possible under national law.
For ERC Grants with more than one principal investigator, the above-mentioned obligations must be ensured
by each beneficiary towards their principal investigators and their teams (and by each principal investigator
towards their beneficiary, the coordinator and the other principal investigators). Moreover, the following
specificities must be observed:
- for the implementation of the action: the corresponding principal investigator bears the overall
responsibility for the supervision of the scientific and technological implementation of the action,
while the other principal investigators must contribute to the overall implementation and supervise
each one their parts
- for the reporting: the corresponding principal investigator assumes the primary responsibility for the
scientific reporting and contribution to the periodic reporting, while the other principal investigators
must contribute to both the scientific and periodic reporting
- for events or circumstances likely to affect the Agreement: each principal investigator must inform
the coordinator, their beneficiary and the other principal investigators
- for portability of the grant by one of the principal investigators (Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41):
- the corresponding principal investigator must verify that the beneficiary of the principal
investigator and the coordinator were informed
- the principal investigator concerned must provide the coordinator and their beneficiary with a
statement on the detailed results of the research up to the time of transfer
- for the internal arrangements (Article 7): they must also cover settlement of disputes between the
principal investigators and between them and the beneficiaries).
For ERC Proof of Concept Grants, the specific rules on reporting (scientific and periodic reporting) and the
special conditions for the principal investigator and their team do not apply.]
423EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Specific rules for ERC Grants (HE)
The specific rules for ERC Grants apply to all HE ERC types of action (i.e. calls with ERC ToA,
including ERC SyG and ERC PoC).
ERC types of action that use actual costs also have two special cost categories in
Article 6.2.D.7 and 6.2.D.8.
2. Actions under the guidance of the principal investigator (PI) (HE)
ERC Grants are designed to attract excellence in fundamental research and focus on principal
investigators (PIs).
PIs do not become party to the Grant Agreement, but they are the key actors, in charge of
the research activities. The host institution which hosts and engages the PI is the one that
must apply for the ERC Grant (and will act as coordinator, in case of multi-beneficiary
grants).
For ERC Synergy Grants (SyG), there might be several host institutions (beneficiaries
hosting and engaging a PI). In this case, the coordinator will be the entity hosting and
engaging the corresponding PI, who will be the administrative contact point for the group of
PIs.
The host institution becomes the signatory of the Grant Agreement and formally subscribes
to the legal and financial obligations under it.
The hosting institution must ensure that the action is performed under the guidance of the PI.
Due to the key role of the PI, they can NOT be replaced by any other researcher during the
action. Requests for amendments to change the PI will be rejected.
Combining ERC & other EU grants — ERC grants do NOT prevent PIs from applying
independently (i.e. in their own name) for further EU funding for other actions or for the same
action, but for costs that are not eligible (or not declared) under the ERC grant.
The fact that the funding rate for ERC grants is 100% does not mean that the grant pays for
100% of the costs of the ERC action. Therefore, cost items not declared under the ERC grant may
be covered by other EU funding.
2. Scientific and financial reporting (HE)
The ERC Grant Agreements set out different reporting periods for the financial and scientific
reporting.
The financial reporting corresponds to the periodic reporting in standard EU grants. The
scientific reporting is a special form of progress reporting.
The scientific reporting is done separately from the periodic reporting (i.e. in addition to the
financial reports which are needed to receive interim and final payments).
Normally, the two types of reports alternate between them. At the end of the action, they are
submitted together in a single periodic report, in order to receive the final payment.
For ERC Starting Grants, Consolidator Grants and Advanced Grants, where the usual duration
is 60 months, the first scientific report is submitted after 24 months, while the first periodic
(financial) report is submitted after 30 months. Depending on the overall duration of the
action the periodicity may change.
424EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For ERC Synergy Grants, where the normal duration is 72 months, the scientific reports are
expected at month 24, 48 and 72, whereas the periodic (financial) reports are expected at
month 18, 36, 54 and 72.
Scientific reports (progress reports):
The scientific reports must be submitted through the Portal (Scientific Reporting tool).
These scientific reports include:
– information about the scientific progress of the work
– the achievements and results of the action
– information on whether and how open access has been provided to the results
– information on how the results have been disseminated
– a summary of the achievements of the action, for publication by the granting
authority.
Financial reports (periodic reports):
The financial reports are available directly through the Portal (Periodic Reporting tool).
These financial reports include:
– an overview of the action implementation indicating in particular any significant
deviation in relation to the DoA Annex 1
– a narrative containing information on the eligible costs, including an explanation on
the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
– an individual financial statement
– a consolidated financial statement, created automatically by the IT system (on the
basis of all financial statements submitted by the beneficiaries and affiliated entities
for the reporting period), which counts as the request of payment
– the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (when required by the Grant
Agreement; see Article 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3).
3. Host and engage the PI (HE)
The principal investigator must be hosted and engaged by the host institution, for the whole
duration of the action.
This obligation is also an eligibility criterion for ERC actions. Like all eligibility criteria, it
must be fulfilled for the entire duration of the action (see Article 7) — otherwise the
action may have to be terminated (see Article 32).
Normally the PI will be employed by the host institution, but there may be cases where the
PI’s employer is a third party who makes the PI available to work for the host institution,
where the PI is self-employed, or where the PI has a particular status in the HI (e.g.
‘emeritus’).
The specific conditions of engagement (which normally should be similar to those of an
employee of the host institution) will be subject to clarification and approval by the granting
authority during the grant preparation (or in case of an amendment request).
425EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
4. Supplementary agreement (HE)
The host institution must — before grant signature — conclude a supplementary agreement
(SA) with the principal investigator.
The ‘Supplementary Agreement (SA)’ is an agreement between the host institution and the
principal investigator to set out their internal arrangements for implementing the grant and
govern their relationship during the ERC action.
The supplementary agreement is NOT intended to replace the employment/engagement
contract.
It should cover all the practical issues that may arise in the context of the grant
implementation and must remain in place at least for the action duration (— without any
interruptions). For ERC Synergy grants (i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs),
each host institution must conclude a supplementary agreement with the PI(s) it engages.
The supplementary agreement must be concluded before grant signature (or in case of
portability before submission of the amendment request) and have the following minimum
content:
Main obligations (towards the PI):
▪ Host and engage the PI for the whole duration of the action
▪ Scientific independence, to achieve the action’s objectives under the best possible
conditions, and within the time agreed
▪ Research support, to conduct the research as described in the Grant Agreement
▪ Access to and protection of intellectual property rights
▪ Adequate working conditions, always in accordance with national law and
institutional rules
▪ Administrative support, to manage the legal and financial aspect of the action
▪ Grant portability, allowing and facilitating the transfer of the grant to another host
institution.
Main obligations (of the PI):
▪ Supervision of the scientific and technological implementation of the action
▪ Responsibility for the scientific reporting and contribution to the financial reporting
▪ Meeting the time commitment for implementing the action (see below”)
▪ Applying the host institution’s usual management practices (in particular,
regarding the way the work is organised, the premises where it is carried out, and
the manner in which it is supervised)
▪ Informing the host institution immediately of any events or circumstances likely to
affect the Grant Agreement
▪ Ensure the visibility of EU funding
▪ Upholding the intellectual property rights of the beneficiaries
This obligation is not limited to respecting the host institution’s intellectual
property rights (IPRs). The PI must actively inform it, if they become aware of any
violations.
426EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: The PI reads a research article and discovers a violation of the host institution’s
project IPRs. They are obliged to inform the host institution.
▪ Maintaining confidentiality.
A template for a model supplementary agreement is available on the ERC website. The model
is not mandatory; beneficiaries may use other clauses, provided they benefit the research
action and do not contradict the Grant Agreement (e.g. if the supplementary agreement
contains additional provisions concerning intellectual property, they must allow the host
institution to comply with its obligations under Article 16 of the Grant Agreement).
The granting authority is NOT party to the supplementary agreement and has NO responsibility
for it (nor for any adverse consequences).
It must NOT contain any provisions contrary to the Grant Agreement. Contradicting provisions are
considered void and cannot be opposed to the granting authority.
5. PI time commitments (HE)
The host institution must make sure that the principal investigator ensures a sufficient time
commitment and presence throughout the action, to guarantee its proper implementation.
The host institution must in particular make sure that the PI complies with the minimum
requirements set out in the DoA Annex 1 regarding working time on the action and working
time in an EU Member State or HE associated country.
These two time commitment obligations are as follows:
- % of working time that the PI must work on the action
- % of working time that the PI must work in an EU Member State or HE associated
country.
To be operational, these two percentages must be translated into working days, i.e.:
- minimum number of days that the PI must work in the action over its duration
- minimum number of days that the PI must work in an EU Member State or HE
associated country over the duration of the action.
The calculation should be done as follows:
Step 1 — For each year of the action, the percentages of PI commitment are applied to
215 fixed annual days.
The 215 fixed annual days work as a ceiling: they apply even if the PI works in total
more days (i.e. has other parallel affiliations, freelance activities or work-related
obligations or works more days on the action). In this case, the time commitment is
capped at 100% and the days are calculated on the 215 fixed annual days.
By contrast, if the PI works in total less days than the 215 fixed annual days, the time
commitment obligation will be reduced proportionally (e.g. in cases of part-time
employment, maternity leave, sick leave…).
The total work of the PI will be determined by adding up all their days of remunerated
work, including under contracts with entities other than the host institution.
Example: The % of PI commitment to the ERC action is 50%. The PI works 129 annual days at
the host institution and has another contract with a different entity to work 35 days over the
year. The days that the PI works in total are 164 days (129 + 35). Since this amount is lower
than the 215 fixed annual days, the time commitment obligation will be: 164 x 50 % = 82 days
427EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 — Sum up the results for each year of Step 1 to get the total number of days over
the action duration.
The percentages must be reached for the overall action duration (NOT annually or per
reporting period).
The PI's time commitments obligations must ALWAYS be fulfilled — even if no personnel
costs are charged for them to the project.
6. Transfer of the GA (portability) (HE)
Portability means that the PIs have a right to request the transfer of their grant to a new host
institution — provided that the objectives of the action remain achievable and that the new
host institution meets the eligibility criteria set out in the ERC work programme/call
conditions.
Portability allows the PI to request the transfer of the entire grant or part of it, and it applies
both in case of mono-beneficiary grants and multi-beneficiary grants. In ERC Synergy Grants
(i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs), each PI has the right to transfer their part
of the action. They must inform and consult the other PIs, to ensure that the action’s
objectives can still be achieved.
ERC grants can thus be transferred to a new host institution (‘new beneficiary’) — at any time
during the action.
Transfers without a formal amendment are void and may result in grant termination. The
former host institution remains fully responsible until the granting authority has approved the
amendment.
The transfer may be based on any ground that is beneficial for the PI and does not affect the
achievement of the action’s objectives.
The transfer may be refused, if the objectives of the action do not remain achievable or if
there is an issue with eligibility (e.g. if the PI requests a transfer to an institution established
in a non-associated third country). In this case the Grant Agreement may be terminated (see
Article 32). Exceptions, in line with the applicable ERC work programme/call conditions, may
apply for ERC Synergy Grants.
In addition, the former host institution (‘former beneficiary’) may oppose a transfer if it is not
allowed under national law.
The transfer conditions (including transfer of team members, intellectual property rights and
equipment) should be negotiated with the new host institution, taking into account the views
of the PI.
Amendment procedure:
Portability transfers are done directly in the Portal Amendment tool as in/out amendment
(AT4 beneficiary termination is combined with AT1 Addition of a new beneficiary; see Article
39; new for 2021-2027).
The procedure is therefore in principle the one for consortium-initiated partner terminations
(see Article 32).
The PI should first contact the host institution that signed the Grant Agreement (i.e. the
former host institution).
Best practice: Both the beneficiaries and the PI should keep records of the consultation and
decision-making process for each portability case.
428EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The former host institution must submit a request for amendment to the granting authority
(see Article 39). The amendment should normally cover both the termination of the old host
institution and the addition of the new host institution.
The termination/addition may exceptionally (and in duly justified cases) not be necessary,
if the old host institution remains in the action as normal beneficiary (and the action becomes
a multi-beneficiary action), but in this case the amendment will have to do a change of
coordinator to change the roles (AT11).
The transfer date must be indicated in the amendment request. If the new host institution
joins the action, the transfer date must be the same date as the accession date. Retroactive
dates may be accepted only in exceptional cases, if duly justified.
In addition, the financial reporting periods may be adapted to match the transfer date (can
be done in the same amendment). The scientific reporting periods will usually remain
unchanged (since the transfer normally has no effect on the scientific implementation of the
action).
For more guidance on amendments, see the Amendment Guide and the Online Manual >
Amendments.
Effects:
The effects are also those of consortium-initiated partner terminations (see Article 32).
The host institution must — within 60 days from either the transfer date or the date of
signature of the amendment whichever is the latest — submit:
− a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned (only in case of
multi-beneficiary grants)
− a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate
on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
The documents will be used for calculating the next payment due to the former beneficiary.
The granting authority will moreover instruct the former host institution to transfer the
remaining pre-financing to the new host institution.
If the PI requests it, the granting authority may also require the former host institution to
transfer equipment that was purchased and used exclusively for the action.
The former host institution may oppose this only if it is not possible under national law. It
may however negotiate transfer conditions with the new host institution, taking into account
the views of the PI.
Thus, the new host institution should make its best effort to buy the equipment fully used for
the project. If it does so, it may declare the costs of this purchase (and any other related
costs, i.e. dismantling, transfer and installation), if they fulfil the eligibility conditions set out
in Article 6. In particular, the purchase price should not be higher than the net accounting
value of the equipment at the former host institution (i.e. initial value of the asset minus
depreciation incurred until the transfer).
Specific cases (ERC):
PI employed by a third party — The PI may be employed not by the host institution but by
a third party (from an EU Member State or HE associated country), i.e.:
− a third party that provides the PI as in-kind contribution or
429EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− an affiliated entity.
This must be specifically justified in the proposal (or amendment request) and included in the
DoA Annex 1.
In this case, the supplementary agreement should be signed by the PI, the host institution
and the third party employing the PI.
Retired PI — The PI may be retired. In this case, there must still be an ‘engagement’
relationship, comparable to an employment relationship, between the PI and the host
institution, ensuring that the PI will have the scientific independence and the necessary rights
to supervise the research and the team, and comply with the rights and obligations specified
in the Grant Agreement.
PI who is also the representative of the host institution— If the PI is at the same time
the representative of the host institution entitled to sign the supplementary agreement on
behalf of the host institution (because of their position in the institution), the supplementary
agreement must be counter-signed by another person empowered by the institution. The PI
can NOT sign their own supplementary agreement for both sides.
Portability — If the Grant Agreement is transferred to another host institution, a new
supplementary agreement must be signed with the new host institution. The new
supplementary agreement must take effect from the grant transfer date (or before). The
Grant Agreement cannot be amended before the new supplementary agreement has been
provided to the granting authority.
Former host institution remains beneficiary — If certain team members (or equipment)
stay with the former host institution, while the PI moves to a new host institution, the Grant
Agreement is transferred and changed into a multi-beneficiary grant (allowing both the
former host institution and the new host institution to participate in the grant). The former
host institution stays on as beneficiary, the organisation that hosts and engages the PI is the
new host institution.
If the former host institution remains only for a limited time (e.g. to ensure a smooth
handover), it can then be terminated at a later stage (see Article 32).
Recruitment costs — The host institution must guarantee the PI scientific independence to
select the other team members. Thus, for ERC actions, recruitment costs, if clearly
attributable to the action, are eligible as ‘other direct costs’, even for the unsuccessful
candidates (because recruitment is part of the action activities).
Purchase of scientific publications — The host institution must provide research support
to the PI regarding any equipment, products or services necessary for conducting the
research. Consequently, costs related to the purchase of scientific publications (e.g. books,
manuscripts, articles, digital copies, etc) may be eligible, if their direct link to the action and
their necessity for the action is demonstrated.
Costs for ‘teaching buy-outs’ — The host institution must support the PI and provide
administrative assistance. However, if the host institution hires substitutes to perform some
of the PI’s duties that are not linked to the ERC grant (e.g. teaching), these costs are NOT
eligible.

1. Background
The Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding programmes for the
demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies.
The Fund provides grants for projects aiming at commercial deployment of innovative
low-carbon technologies, with the objective to bring to the market industrial solutions
to decarbonise Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.
The objectives of this call are to:
(a) support projects on electric vehicle battery cells manufacturing demonstrating
innovative technologies, processes or products, that are sufficiently mature and
have a significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
(b) offer financial support tailored to market needs and risk profiles of eligible
projects, while attracting additional public and private resources.
Projects to be funded by this call are expected to contribute to:
5Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
− the transition to a climate-neutral economy by 2050, notably in terms of
decarbonisation of transport.
− the target to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990) as
defined in the European Climate Law Regulation 2021/11196 and the European
Green Deal7, including the measures adopted under the Fitfor55 package.
− increased investments in the EU’s electric vehicle battery manufacturing
capacity and their resilient value chains in line with the Net Zero Industry Act8
establishing a framework of measures for strengthening Europe’s net-zero
technology manufacturing ecosystem. China has the world’s largest
manufacturing capacity (90% of global capacity for cathode active material and
97% of anode active material) and will account for over 85% of capacity
additions by 2030 that would meet or surpass 2030 demand in the global net
zero scenarios9 The EU has a significant reliance on this source of supply, which
leads to a risk of irreversible dependency that may threaten the EU’s security
of supply. Thus, special measures on limiting sourcing from China are justified
in this industry, contributing to the objectives of the Net Zero Industry Act.
Synergies and complementarities with other relevant EU programmes are highly
encouraged. For example, the Innovation Fund can support projects previously
supported by the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation.
Funded projects are also expected to contribute to several interrelated EU policy
initiatives (when relevant):
− The Green Deal Industrial Plan10 aiming to provide a more supportive
environment for the scaling up of the EU's manufacturing capacity for the net-
zero technologies and products required to meet Europe's ambitious climate
targets.
− The New Industrial Strategy for Europe 202011 and 202112, the 2020

Objectives
This topic supports projects on electric vehicle battery cells manufacturing in order to
enhance Europe’s industrial capacity and leadership in this net-zero technology and to
ensure that battery production capacity in the EU/EEA is ready to respond to increased
demand for electric vehicles, in line with the mandatory standards on CO2 emission
performance of light- and heavy-duty vehicles.
Activities that can be funded (scope)
Manufacturing of cells that can be used in electric vehicle batteries.
Electric vehicle batteries are defined in the Battery Regulation21 as follows:
“‘electric vehicle battery’ means a battery that is specifically designed to provide electric
power for traction in hybrid or electric vehicles of category L as provided for in
Regulation (EU) No 168/2013, that weighs more than 25 kg, or a battery that is
specifically designed to provide electric power for traction in hybrid or electric vehicles
of categories M, N or O as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2018/858.”
Optionally, the project (i.e. in case of horizontally integrated projects) may also include
the additional production of upstream components such as:
• cathode precursor material (pCAM),
• cathode active material (CAM),
• anode active material (AAM),
• electrolyte,
• separator
as well as battery or battery material recycling.
The outputs of upstream component production steps or recycling included in the
project scope may not exceed 100% of the project's battery cell production capacity
(outputs going beyond 100% cannot be included in the project scope).
New patents originating from the project, during the project’s duration (i.e. ‘results’
within the meaning of Article 16 of the Grant Agreement) must be registered in an EU
Member State or EEA country.
Please see Annex 4 that provides clarification on relationship between project scope
and what is included in the methodology for GHG emission avoidance calculation.
Only projects that have not reached financial close at proposal submission date can
be funded.

Guidance on the relevant cost methodology. For each item of capital expenditure,
please read the definitions of each individual term in Appendix 1 of the Guidance on the
relevant cost methodology.
The grant awarded may be lower than the amount requested.
7. Financial and operational capacity and exclusion
Financial capacity
Applicants must have stable and sufficient resources to successfully implement the
projects and contribute their share. Organisations participating in several projects must
have sufficient capacity to implement all projects.
The financial capacity check will be carried out on the basis of the documents which
you will be requested later on by the Central Validation Service during grant preparation
to upload in the Participant Register (e.g. profit and loss account and balance sheet,
audit report produced by an approved external auditor, certifying the accounts for the
last closed financial year, etc). The analysis will be based on neutral financial indicators,
but will also take into account other aspects, such as dependency on EU funding and
deficit and revenue in previous years.
The check will normally be done for all beneficiaries, except:
− public bodies (entities established as public body under national law, including
local, regional or national authorities) or international organisations
− if the individual requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60 000.
If needed, it may also be done for affiliated entities.
If we consider that your financial capacity is not satisfactory, we may require:
− further information
− an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility
for all beneficiaries or joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see below,
section 10)
or
− request that you are replaced or, if needed, reject the entire proposal.
For more information, see Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Operational capacity
Applicants must have the know-how, qualifications and resources to successfully
implement the projects and contribute their share (including sufficient experience in
projects of comparable size and nature).
This capacity will be assessed together with the ‘Project maturity’ award criterion, on
the basis of the competence and experience of the applicants and their project teams,
including operational resources (human, technical and other) or, exceptionally, the
measures proposed to obtain it by the time the task implementation starts.
14Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
If the evaluation of the award criterion is positive, the applicants are considered to have
sufficient operational capacity.
Applicants will have to show their capacity via the following information:
− general profiles (qualifications and experiences) of the staff responsible for
managing and implementing the project (including CVs)
− description of the consortium participants (including previous projects, if any)
Additional supporting documents may be requested, if needed to confirm the
operational capacity of any applicant.
Exclusion
Applicants which are subject to an EU exclusion decision or in one of the following
exclusion situations that bar them from receiving EU funding can NOT participate27:
− bankruptcy, winding up, affairs administered by the courts, arrangement with
creditors, suspended business activities or other similar procedures (including
procedures for persons with unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts)
− in breach of social security or tax obligations (including if done by persons with
unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts)
− guilty of grave professional misconduct28 (including if done by persons having
powers of representation, decision-making or control, beneficial owners or

− committed fraud, corruption, links to a criminal organisation, money laundering,
terrorism-related crimes (including terrorism financing), child labour or human
trafficking (including if done by persons having powers of representation,
decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for
the award/implementation of the grant)
− shown significant deficiencies in complying with main obligations under an EU
procurement contract, grant agreement, prize, expert contract, or similar
(including if done by persons having powers of representation, decision-making
or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the
award/implementation of the grant)
− guilty of irregularities within the meaning of Article 1(2) of EU Regulation
2988/95 (including if done by persons having powers of representation,
decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for
the award/implementation of the grant)
− created under a different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social
or other legal obligations in the country of origin or created another entity with
this purpose (including if done by persons having powers of representation,
decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for
the award/implementation of the grant).
27 See Articles 138 and 143 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
28 ‘Professional misconduct’ includes, in particular, the following: violation of ethical standards of the

− intentionally and without proper justification resisted29 an investigation, check
or audit carried out by an EU authorising officer (or their representative or
auditor), OLAF, the EPPO, or the European Court of Auditors.
Applicants will also be rejected if it turns out that30:
− during the award procedure they misrepresented information required as a
condition for participating or failed to supply that information
− they were previously involved in the preparation of the call and this entails a
distortion of competition that cannot be remedied otherwise (conflict of
interest).
8. Evaluation and award procedure
The proposals will have to follow the standard submission and evaluation
procedure (one-stage submission + one-step evaluation).
An evaluation committee (composed fully of independent outside experts) will assess
all applications. Proposals will first be checked for formal requirements (admissibility,
and eligibility, see sections 5 and 6). Proposals found admissible and eligible will be
evaluated (for each topic) against the operational capacity and award criteria (see
sections 7 and 9) and then ranked according to their scores.
Cascade approach
Proposals will be evaluated (within their respective topic) according to the following
cascade:
1) ‘Degree of innovation’. If a proposal scores less than the minimum threshold
under this criterion, the evaluation is stopped (the remaining criteria are
neither evaluated nor scored)
2) ‘GHG emission avoidance potential’, ‘Manufacturing carbon footprint
reduction’ and ‘Project maturity’. If a proposal does not reach the minimum
threshold under any of the ‘Project maturity’ sub-criteria (technical, financial,
operational maturity) or if it scores less than the minimum threshold under
sub-criterion ‘Quality of the GHG emission avoidance calculation and
minimum requirements’, the evaluation is stopped (the remaining criteria are
neither evaluated nor scored)
3) ‘Cost efficiency’. If a proposal scores less than the minimum threshold under
the sub-criterion ‘Quality of the cost calculation and minimum requirements’,
the evaluation is stopped (the remaining criteria are neither evaluated nor
scored)
4) ‘Replicability’, and ‘Security of supply and countering dependency’.
Priority order for proposals with same scores
For proposals with the same score (within a topic) a priority order will be determined
according to the following approach:
29 ‘Resisting an investigation, check or audit’ means carrying out actions with the goal or effect of
preventing, hindering or delaying the conduct of any of the activities needed to perform the investigation,
check or audit, such as refusing to grant the necessary access to its premises or any other areas used
for business purposes, concealing or refusing to disclose information or providing false information.
30 See Article 143 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
16Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
Successively for every group of ex aequo proposals, starting with the highest scored
group, and continuing in descending order:
1) Proposals located in a country (EU Member State, EEA country) with a lower
number of higher-ranked proposals will be considered to have higher
priority; the prioritisation order will be established on the basis of the
country related to the “main project location” indicated in part C of the
application.
2) If this doesn’t allow to determine the priority, proposals that have more
points for the criterion ‘Manufacturing carbon footprint reduction’ will be
given priority.
3) If this also doesn’t suffice, proposals that received more points under the
criterion ‘Security of supply and countering dependency’ will be given
priority.
Evaluation result and grant preparation
All proposals will be informed about the evaluation result (evaluation result letter).
Successful proposals will be invited for grant preparation; the other ones will be rejected
(or put on the reserve list, if any).
Grant preparation will involve a dialogue in order to fine-tune technical or financial
aspects of the project and may require extra information from your side. It may also
include adjustments to the proposal to address recommendations of the evaluation
committee or other concerns (such as adaptation of the grant due to additional funding
received from other sources). Full compliance will be a pre-condition for signing the
grant.
No commitment for funding — Invitation to grant preparation does NOT constitute
a formal commitment for funding. We will still need to make various legal checks before
grant award: legal entity validation, financial capacity, exclusion check, etc.
If you believe that the evaluation procedure was flawed, you can submit a complaint
(following the deadlines and procedures set out in the evaluation result letter). Please
note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending will be
considered to have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from
opening/access (see also Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions). Please also
be aware that for complaints submitted electronically, there may be character
limitations.
Project development assistance (PDA)
Proposals that are not recommended for funding (including those on the reserve list, if
any) and rejected proposals that reach the minimum thresholds for ‘Quality of the GHG
emission avoidance calculation and minimum requirements’ and ‘Degree of innovation’
(if applicable in accordance with the evaluation in cascade) will be proposed for project
development assistance (PDA) support to the European Investment Bank (EIB), if they
have given their consent in the application form.
Please be aware that, for proposals that agree to be proposed for PDA, the
applications (and project documentation) will be shared with the EIB and will be used
by them for their assessment. You may be required to submit additional documents or
information for the PDA support.
STEP seal
17Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
Eligible proposals that exceed the evaluation thresholds will be awarded the STEP
seal31. The STEP seal is a quality label, whose main purpose is to facilitate funding from
other private and public sources.
9. Award criteria
The award criteria for this call are as follows:
1. Degree of innovation
− Innovation in relation to the state of the art (10 points): degree
to which the project goes beyond incremental innovation on a scale
from intermediate to breakthrough innovation, including scaling-up (see
Annex 1 for examples) taking into account the European level as
reference point; quality, soundness and reliability of the information
provided in the proposal.
Innovation in battery cell manufacturing can be demonstrated in the final
product performance (in terms of e.g. energy density, expected storage
performance over lifetime, fast charging, long cycle life, reduced use of
raw materials, circularity or uniqueness of technology) or in the battery
manufacturing processes (in terms of e.g. innovative and more efficient
process techniques, application of innovative digital technologies,
integration of recycling of materials).
Projects aimed at scaling up innovative techniques, processes and
technologies with a view to their broad roll-out and which contribute
significantly to the decarbonisation of the sectors covered by Innovation
Fund can be also considered innovative and therefore eligible for support.
If the production process or product, that the applicant proposes, has
already been awarded by the Innovation Fund, the proposal must clearly
justify where the new innovative elements of the proposed project lie
(e.g. scale, type of application, difference in some elements). Proposals
aiming at innovations that are very similar to ongoing Innovation Fund
projects may receive a lower score. Please consult the list of funded
projects on the Innovation Fund Project Portfolio Dashboard.
2. GHG emission avoidance potential
− Absolute GHG emission avoidance (2 points): difference between
the expected total (use phase and manufacturing carbon footprint) GHG
emissions of the project and the total GHG emissions in the reference
scenario during 10 years after entry into operation (calculation using the
GHG emission avoidance calculator and following the Guidance on the
GHG emission avoidance methodology).
For avoidance of doubt, the ‘manufacturing carbon footprint reduction’ is
a subset of the absolute GHG emissions calculation. The absolute GHG
emissions avoidance presents the sum of the project’s emissions
avoidance in the manufacturing process plus emissions avoided in the
use phase of the battery.
In terms of scoring of this sub-criterion: the proposals with an
absolute emission avoidance equal to the median will be scored 1. All
other proposals will be given a score between 0 and 2 (rounded to the
31 The STEP seal is also referred to as the Sovereignty Seal; see Article 4 of the STEP Regulation 2024/795.

nearest half point), according to their absolute GHG emission avoidance
proportional to the median. The median value will be calculated taking
into account only proposals that meet all the minimum thresholds for
‘Degree of innovation’, ‘Project maturity’ and ‘Quality of the GHG
emission avoidance calculation and minimum requirements’. In case
there is only one proposal that meets these thresholds, this proposal will
receive 2 points and all other proposals will receive 1 point. In case there
is only one proposal, this proposal will receive 2 points.
− Relative GHG emission avoidance (5 points): absolute GHG emission
avoidance divided by the GHG emissions in the reference scenario over
the same 10 year period (calculation using the GHG emission avoidance
calculator and following the Guidance on the GHG emission avoidance
methodology).
The score of this sub-criterion is proportional to the relative GHG
emission avoidance, rounded to the nearest half point. The minimum
score is 0 (for 0%). The maximum score is 5 (for 100% or above).
− Quality of the GHG emission avoidance calculation and minimum
requirements (5 points): quality and credibility of the calculation of
GHG emission avoidance potential (for avoidance of doubt, the quality of
the calculation of the manufacturing carbon footprint reduction is also
assessed under this criterion); whether the proposed action meets or not
the minimum requirements in terms of:
− the relative GHG emission avoidance must be:
− at least 50%.
In case of issues in the quality of the calculation (including reliability
and margin of uncertainty of key parameters and/or assumptions), points
may be reduced.
In case the calculation methodology is incorrectly applied or in case the
Application Form Part B or the GHG emission avoidance calculator have
not been filled correctly, the score for this sub-criterion will be below the
minimum threshold and the proposal will be rejected.
3. Manufacturing carbon footprint reduction
− Manufacturing carbon footprint reduction in relation to the
reference case (15 points): the difference between the expected GHG
emissions of the project’s manufacturing process and the GHG emissions
of the manufacturing reference scenario, divided by the GHG emissions
of the manufacturing reference scenario during 10 years after entry into
operation (expressed in %; calculation using the GHG emission
avoidance calculator and following the Guidance on the GHG emission
avoidance methodology).
In terms of scoring of this criterion: The proposal that reaches the highest
manufacturing carbon footprint emissions avoidance (expressed in %)
and meets all the minimum thresholds for ‘Degree of innovation’, ‘Project
maturity’ and ‘Quality of the GHG emission avoidance calculation and
minimum requirements’ will receive a score of 15. Proposals that do not
reach the minimum thresholds for ‘Degree of innovation’, ‘Project
maturity’ or ‘Quality of the GHG emission avoidance calculation and
minimum requirements’ will receive a score of 0. All other proposals will
19Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
be given a score between 0 and 15 (rounded to the nearest half point),
according to the linear proportion between zero and the highest
manufacturing carbon footprint reduction (expressed in %) as
determined above.
4. Project maturity
− Technical maturity (5 points): technical feasibility of achieving the
expected project outputs within the project’s operational environment;
understanding of technology and related technical risks and proposed
risk mitigation measures; quality, soundness and reliability of the
information provided in the proposal.
− Financial maturity (5 points): ability to reach financial close as soon
as possible and no later than 48 months after signing the grant
agreement (taking into account credibility of the business model,
business plan and financial model, expected project profitability and
credibility of the support of the project shareholders to fund the project);
robustness and credibility of the strategy to secure key contractual
framework including supply and off-take contracts; soundness of the
financing plan along the project milestones and of the expected sources
of financing, including private-sector contributions, Member State
support or other types of public support, where relevant; solidity of
expected debt terms, level of negotiation with debt funders and capital
structure in line with the project risks and returns; understanding of the
project’s business and financial risks, including risks stemming from
dependencies on other projects falling outside the boundaries of the
project, and quality of proposed risk mitigation measures; quality,
soundness and reliability of the information provided in the proposal.
− Operational maturity (5 points): credibility and level of detail of the
project implementation plan covering all project milestones (which must
include at least financial close, entry into operation and annual reporting
after the entry into operation) and related deliverables; relevance and
track record of the project management/team and soundness of the
project organisation; state of play and credibility of the proposed plan for
obtaining required permits, intellectual property rights or licences and
other regulatory procedures, including steps to be taken to ensure public
acceptance; ability to reach entry into operation in line with market
standards in the sector or faster; understanding of the project’s
implementation risks, including risks stemming from dependencies on
other projects falling outside the boundaries of the project, and credibility
of proposed risk mitigation measures; quality, soundness and reliability
of the information provided in the proposal.
The project’s demonstrated ability to reach financial close within 12 months
and entry into operation within 36 months will be considered as
advantageous grounds resulting in a higher score, provided that all other
aspects of the project maturity criterion are addressed.
5. Replicability
− Replicability in terms of efficiency gains and multiple
environmental impacts (5 points): efficient use of resources or other
ways to address resource constraints notably in terms of reduction
and/or more efficient use of critical raw materials32, sustainable biomass
and other scarce resources, and in terms of circularity, recycling and
32 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/raw-materials/areas-specific-interest/critical-raw-materials_en
20Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
recyclability of such resources; potential to address multiple
environmental impacts, such as increasing biodiversity protection and for
reducing land, air and water pollution; quality, soundness and reliability
of the information provided in the proposal.
− Replicability in terms of further deployment (5 points): plans for
project/technology/solution transfer to other sites (regionally or across
the EU economy or globally where relevant), including potential for
technology transfer beyond sector, where relevant; related expected
additional emission avoidance; knowledge sharing plan outline; quality,
soundness and reliability of the information provided in the proposal.
− Contribution to Europe’s industrial leadership and
competitiveness (5 points): supporting the European batteries
ecosystem (components, including cathodes and anodes, from EU/EEA
suppliers, machinery/manufacturing equipment from EU/EEA suppliers);
creation of IP rights (patents) registered in Europe in the past five years
or demonstrating batteries research activities in the EU/EEA, e.g. through
on-going cooperation programmes with EU/EEA universities or research
institutes); reduction of consumption of critical raw materials (EU list of
critical raw materials33), use of secondary raw materials, recycling or
other strategies helping to reduce dependencies on critical raw materials;
jobs created, trainings or other actions to develop know-how in Europe;
quality, soundness and reliability of the information provided in the
proposal.
Supporting the European batteries ecosystem and creation of IP rights
or demonstrating batteries research in EU/EEA have higher importance.
6. Security of supply and countering dependency
− Security of supply and countering dependency (15 points): degree
of diversification of the supply of cathode active materials (CAM) and
anode active materials (AAM) from China during the project’s monitoring
period: the less CAM and AAM the project will source from China, the
better it can score; quality, soundness and reliability of the information
provided in the proposal.
Projects that aim at expanding or converting existing facilities must
demonstrate diversification of CAM and AAM sourcing from China,
compared to existing operations over the last 2 years.
7. Cost efficiency
− Cost efficiency ratio (3 points): cost effectiveness (ratio between
requested grant and absolute GHG emission avoidance i.e. the sum of
the calculated manufacturing and use phase emission reductions)
The following scoring rules will apply for this sub-criterion:
− The cost efficiency ratio is expressed as follows:
𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑒𝑒𝑅𝑅 𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝐶𝐶
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝐶𝐶𝑒𝑒𝐶𝐶=

21Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
− The maximum Innovation Fund grant that can be requested
is limited to 60% of the relevant costs; the applicants can
request less and can take this smaller amount as numerator
in the cost efficiency ratio calculation. If the applicant
considers additional project-specific public support34 in the
project financial model it must be added to the Innovation
Fund grant amount in the numerator of the cost efficiency
ratio. Public support during the operational period should be
added for only the first ten years of operation.
− Relevant costs are calculated according to the Guidance on
the relevant cost methodology.
− The absolute GHG emission avoidance used is the same
value calculated for the sub-criterion ‘Absolute GHG
emission avoidance’.
− The score is calculated as follows:
− if the cost efficiency ratio is lower or equal than 200 EUR/t
CO2-eq, the points are calculated based on the following
formula:
3 – (3 x (cost efficiency ratio / 200)
− if the cost efficiency ratio is higher than 200 EUR/t CO2-eq,
the score is zero points, and the proposal will be rejected.
The result is rounded to the nearest half point. The minimum
score under this sub-criterion is 0. The maximum score is 3.
− Quality of the cost calculation and minimum requirements (3
points): quality and credibility of the calculation of the relevant costs;
when relevant, whether the proposed action meets or not the minimum
requirements in terms of:
− the cost efficiency ratio must be
− equal or lower than 200 EUR/t CO2-eq
In case of issues in the quality and credibility of the calculation
(including the inclusion of non-eligible costs), points may be reduced.
In the case the calculation of relevant costs contains substantial errors
or if the Application Form Part B or the relevant costs calculator template
have not been filled completely, the score for this sub-criterion will be
below the minimum threshold and the proposal will be rejected.
In case of incorrect calculation of the cost efficiency ratio the score
for this sub-criterion will be below the minimum threshold and the
proposal will be rejected.
34 This can be support from other EU funding programmes or national funding (State aid). In terms of State
aid, applicants should include here State aid (for example in in the form of grants, contracts for
difference, and feed-in tariffs) requested or planned to request, and which have been included in the
financial model. State aid in the form of fiscal or parafiscal measures or tariff reductions must not be
included in the numerator of the cost efficiency ratio, but should be included in the projections of the
financial model and may also impact the relevant costs calculation. Be aware that information about
additional public support may be shared with other EU services. For both State aid and EU funding
programmes, the rules on combined public support must be respected.

Individual thresholds (minimum pass scores) per criterion/sub-criterion: see above.
There is no overall threshold.
Proposals that pass the individual thresholds will be considered for funding — within
the limits of the available budget (i.e. up to the budget ceiling). Other proposals will be
rejected.
10. Legal and financial set-up of the Grant Agreements
If you pass the evaluation, your project will be invited for grant preparation, where you
will be asked to prepare the Grant Agreement together with the EU Project Officer.
This Grant Agreement will set the framework for your grant and its terms and
conditions, in particular concerning deliverables, reporting and payments.
The Model Grant Agreement that will be used (and all other relevant templates and
guidance documents) can be found on Portal Reference Documents.
Starting date and project duration
The project starting date and duration will be fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data Sheet,
point 1). Normally the starting date will be after grant signature. A retroactive starting
date can be granted exceptionally for duly justified reasons — but never earlier than
the first day of the month after the proposal submission date.
Project duration: see section 6 above.
Milestones and deliverables
The milestones and deliverables for each project will be managed through the Portal
Grant Management System and will be reflected in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement.
The following work packages, deliverables and milestones will be required:

made under the criteria ‘Degree of Innovation’, ‘Replicability’ and
‘Security of supply and countering dependency’ and, in particular, the
EU/EEA patent registration requirement for new patents resulting from
the action set out in section 2 (all at the end of the last year of operation).
Additional work packages (and the corresponding milestones and deliverables) can be
added in the phase before financial close or between financial close and entry into
operation, if needed to respect the logic of the project.
Form of grant, funding rate and maximum grant amount
The grant parameters (e.g. maximum grant amount) will be fixed in the Grant
Agreement (Data Sheet, point 3 and art 5).
Project budget (requested grant amount): see section 6 above.
The grant will be a lump sum grant. This means that it will reimburse a fixed amount,
based on a lump sum. The amount will be fixed by the granting authority on the basis
of the relevant costs of the project calculated in accordance with the Guidance on the
relevant cost methodology and a fixed funding rate of 60% (or lower requested grant
amount, if any).
Budget categories and cost eligibility rules
The budget categories and cost eligibility rules are fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data
Sheet, point 3, art 6 and Annex 2).
Budget categories for this call:
− Lump sum contributions35
Specific cost eligibility rules for this call:
− the lump sum amount must be calculated in accordance with the methodology
set out in the lump sum decision and using the detailed budget table/relevant
cost calculator (financial information file) provided
− the lump sum calculation should respect the following conditions:
− the relevant costs must be calculated in accordance with the Guidance on
the relevant cost methodology and be confirmed at entry into operation
35 Decision of 02 July 2020 authorising the use of lump sums for projects under the Innovation Fund.
26Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
− costs for activities incurred before the first day of the month after the
proposal submission date are not eligible
− the lump sum breakdown must comply with the following:
− the estimated lump sum contribution for each work package must relate to
and be proportional to the activities covered by that work package
− the portion of the grant amount budgeted until the financial close must not
exceed 40% of the maximum grant amount
− the portion of the grant amount budgeted after entry into operation should
amount to at least 10% of the maximum grant amount
− other:
− the maximum grant amount will only be paid out, if over the entire project
duration, the project reaches at least 75% of the total amount of GHG
emission planned to be avoided.
Please be aware that during grant agreement preparation, the lump sum
contributions may be reallocated between work packages, if, for instance, the shares
are not proportional to the activities/expenditure covered by the corresponding work
packages.
Shortly before entry into operation, you will be required to submit a statement by
an independent auditor confirming the correctness of the relevant cost calculation. If
capital or operating costs and revenues, such as the carbon or energy prices, have
changed significantly and decreased the relevant costs below the amount of the grant,
you may be asked to request an amendment to reduce the maximum grant amount. If
you do not comply with this request, we may have to terminate the grant and reduce
it from our side (see art 28 and 32).
The amount of GHG emission avoidance will be checked on the basis of the verified
GHG emission avoidance report (required as deliverable at the end of the project; see
above). If less than 75% of the targeted amount is reached at the end of the project,
the amount of the grant paid after the financial close will be proportionally reduced. If
the project fails to enter into operation or the beneficiary fails to demonstrate any real
avoidance of GHG emissions, we may terminate and the full grant amount after financial
close will be recovered (see art 28 and 32).
The claims under the criteria ‘Degree of innovation’, ‘Contribution to Europe’s
industrial leadership and competitiveness’ and ‘Security of supply and countering
dependency’ and, in particular, the EU/EEA patent registration requirement for new
patents resulting from the action set out in section 2 must be fulfilled. If this cannot be
demonstrated at the end of the action, the grant may be reduced (see art 28).
Reporting and payment arrangements
The reporting and payment arrangements are fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data
Sheet, point 4 and art 21 and 22).
There is no pre-financing payment.
There will be one or more interim payments:
− up to 40% of the maximum grant amount for the reporting periods (RPs) until
financial close, depending on the value of the work package(s)
27Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
− remaining amount of at least 60% for the RP(s) after financial close, depending
on the value of the work package(s); generally, at least 10% for the period after
Entry into operation.
You will be required to provide periodic reports to request payments, in accordance
with the schedule and modalities set out in the grant agreement. After the entry into
operation, the periodic reports will be annual.
In addition, you will be expected to submit one or more progress reports not linked to
payments.
Payment of the balance: At the end of the project, we will calculate your final grant
amount. If the total of earlier payments is higher than the final grant amount, we will
ask you (your coordinator) to pay back the difference (recovery).
All payments will be made to the coordinator.
Please be aware that payments will be automatically lowered if you or one of your
consortium members has outstanding debts towards the EU (granting authority or other
EU bodies). Such debts will be offset by us — in line with the conditions set out in the
Grant Agreement (see art 22).
Please also note that you are responsible for keeping records on all the work done.

Liability regime for recoveries
The liability regime for recoveries will be fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data Sheet,
point 4.4 and art 22).
For beneficiaries, it is one of the following:
− limited joint and several liability with individual ceilings — each beneficiary up
to their maximum grant amount
− unconditional joint and several liability — each beneficiary up to the maximum
grant amount for the action
or
− individual financial responsibility — each beneficiary only for their own debts.
In addition, the granting authority may require joint and several liability of affiliated
entities (with their beneficiary).

11. How to submit an application
All proposals must be submitted directly online via the Funding & Tenders Portal
Electronic Submission System. Paper applications are NOT accepted.
Submission is a 2-step process:
a) create a user account and register your organisation
To use the Submission System (the only way to apply), all participants need to create
an EU Login user account.
Once you have an EU Login account, you can register your organisation in the
Participant Register. When your registration is finalised, you will receive a 9-digit
participant identification code (PIC).
b) submit the proposal
Access the Electronic Submission System via the Topic page in the Calls for proposals
section (or, for calls sent by invitation to submit a proposal, through the link provided
in the invitation letter).
Submit your proposal in 4 parts, as follows:
29Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
− Part A includes administrative information about the applicant organisations
(future coordinator, beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated partners)
and the summarised budget for the proposal. Fill it in directly online
− Part B (description of the action) covers the technical content of the proposal.
Download the mandatory word template from the Submission System, fill it in
and upload it as a PDF file
− Part C containing additional project data. To be filled in directly online.
− Annexes (see section 5). Upload them as PDF file (single or multiple depending
on the slots). Excel upload is sometimes possible, depending on the file type.
− The proposal must keep to the page limits (see section 5); excess pages will
be disregarded.
Documents must be uploaded to the right category in the Submission System,
otherwise the proposal may be considered incomplete and thus inadmissible.
The proposal must be submitted before the call deadline (see section 4). After this
deadline, the system is closed and proposals can no longer be submitted.
Once the proposal is submitted, you will receive a confirmation e-mail (with date and
time of your application). If you do not receive this confirmation e-mail, it means your
proposal has NOT been submitted. If you believe this is due to a fault in the Submission
System, you should immediately file a complaint via the IT Helpdesk webform,
explaining the circumstances and attaching a copy of the proposal (and, if possible,
screenshots to show what happened).
Details on processes and procedures are described in the Online Manual. The Online
Manual also contains the links to FAQs and detailed instructions regarding the Portal
Electronic Exchange System.

13. Important
IMPORTANT
• Don’t wait until the end — Complete your application sufficiently in advance of the
deadline to avoid any last minute technical problems. Problems due to last minute
submissions (e.g. congestion, etc) will be entirely at your risk. Call deadlines can NOT
be extended.
• Consult the Portal Topic page regularly. We will use it to publish updates and
additional information on the call (call and topic updates).
• Funding & Tenders Portal Electronic Exchange System — By submitting the
application, all participants accept to use the electronic exchange system in
accordance with the Portal Terms & Conditions.
• Registration — Before submitting the application, all beneficiaries, affiliated entities
and associated partners must be registered in the Participant Register. The
participant identification code (PIC) (one per participant) is mandatory for the
Application Form.
• Consortium roles — When setting up your consortium, you should think of
organisations that help you reach objectives and solve problems.
The roles should be attributed according to the level of participation in the project.
Main participants should participate as beneficiaries or affiliated entities; other
entities can participate as associated partners, subcontractors, third parties giving
in-kind contributions. Associated partners and third parties giving in-kind
contributions should bear their own costs (they will not become formal recipients of
EU funding). Subcontracting should normally constitute a limited part and must be
performed by third parties (not by one of the beneficiaries/affiliated entities).
• Coordinator — In multi-beneficiary grants, the beneficiaries participate as
consortium (group of beneficiaries). They will have to choose a coordinator, who will
take care of the project management and coordination and will represent the
consortium towards the granting authority. In mono-beneficiary grants, the single
beneficiary will automatically be coordinator.
• Affiliated entities — Applicants may participate with affiliated entities (i.e. entities
linked to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and
obligations as the beneficiaries, but do not sign the grant and therefore do not
become beneficiaries themselves). They will get a part of the grant money and must
therefore comply with all the call conditions and be validated (just like beneficiaries);
but they do not count towards the minimum eligibility criteria for consortium
composition (if any). If affiliated entities participate in your project, please do not
forget to provide documents demonstrating their affiliation link to your organisation
as part of your application.
• Associated partners — Applicants may participate with associated partners (i.e.
partner organisations which participate in the action but without the right to get grant
money). They participate without funding and therefore do not need to be validated.
• Consortium agreement — For practical and legal reasons it is recommended in all
cases to set up internal arrangements that allow you to deal with exceptional or
unforeseen circumstances. The consortium agreement also gives you the possibility
to redistribute the grant money according to your own consortium-internal principles
and parameters (for instance, one beneficiary can reattribute its grant money to
another beneficiary). The consortium agreement thus allows you to customise the EU
grant to the needs inside your consortium and can also help to protect you in case of
disputes. For successful proposals, the consortium agreement should be signed
before the signature of the grant agreement.
31Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
• Balanced project budget — Grant applications must ensure a balanced project
budget and sufficient other resources to implement the project successfully (e.g. own
contributions, income generated by the action, financial contributions from third
parties, etc). You may be requested to lower your estimated costs, if they are
ineligible (including excessive).
• Completed/ongoing projects — Proposals for projects that have already been
completed will be rejected; proposals for projects that have already started will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis (in this case, no costs can be reimbursed for
activities that took place before the project starting date/proposal submission).
• Cumulation of funding — Innovation Fund grants may be combined with funding
from another EU programme (directly managed by the EU Commission), if in both
grants the EU Synergies actions’ clause is enabled in Article 6.3 of the Model Grant
Agreement and the combined funding rates at grant level do not exceed 100% (see
AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 6.3).
• Combination with EU operating grants — Combination with EU operating grants
is possible, if the project remains outside the operating grant work programme and
you make sure that cost items are clearly separated in your accounting and NOT
declared twice (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 6.2.E).
• Multiple proposals — Applicants may submit more than one proposal for different
projects under the same call (and be awarded funding for them).
Organisations may participate in several proposals.
BUT: if there are several proposals for very similar projects, only one application will
be accepted and evaluated; the applicants will be asked to withdraw the others (or
they will be rejected).
• Resubmission — Proposals may be changed and re-submitted until the deadline for
submission.
• Rejection — By submitting the application, all applicants accept the call conditions
set out in this this Call document (and the documents it refers to). Proposals that do
not comply with all the call conditions will be rejected. This applies also to applicants:
All applicants need to fulfil the criteria; if any one of them doesn’t, they must be
replaced or the entire proposal will be rejected.
• Cancellation — There may be circumstances which may require the cancellation of
the call. In this case, you will be informed via a call or topic update. Please note that
cancellations are without entitlement to compensation.
• Language — You can submit your proposal in any official EU language (project
abstract/summary should however always be in English). For reasons of efficiency,
we strongly advise you to use English for the entire application. If you need the call
documentation in another official EU language, please submit a request within 10
days after call publication (for the contact information, see section 12).

Annex 1
Innovation
Innovation in relation to the state of the art
Types of innovative actions
The Innovation Fund aims to support technologies, business models and processes that
are not yet commercially available, but represent breakthrough solutions or are
sufficiently mature to be ready for demonstration at pre-commercial scale.
Thus, a project may consist of a first-of-a-kind commercialisation or large-scale
commercial size demonstration of technologies, processes or business models
previously proven at pilot or smaller scale, or large-scale demonstration plants.
A second or more of a kind commercialisation can also be considered innovative under
certain conditions. In particular, where the relevant costs remain a significant share of
total costs that prohibit commercialisation without further public support.
Smaller demonstrations or pilot plants are also eligible for support, especially if this is
the right scale at which technology needs to be proven before moving to a larger scale
demonstration.
Projects aimed at scaling up innovative techniques, processes and technologies with a
view to their broad roll-out and which contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of
the sectors covered by Innovation Fund can be also considered innovative and are
eligible for support.
State-of-the-art: commercial and technological
The state-of-the-art for a proposed production process, product or service or business
model comprises both the characteristics of the commercially available process, product
or service that is most similar to the proposed one (commercial state-of-the-art) and
the already proved characteristics of the proposed technological solution at the highest
technological readiness level (technological state-of-the-art). Hence, a proposed
project activity or product may be considered as innovative compared to the state-of-
the-art if:
− it differs from that normally offered by existing vendors/technology suppliers
with respect to key characteristics, such as quality of service, carbon footprint,
resource use, etc
− it is not currently offered in the EU market by multiple vendors or it is not offered
as a standard product or service from a single vendor
− its expected outcomes go well beyond existing solutions
− it is further advanced from previously conducted demonstrations for instance in
terms of technology readiness level (TRL) or more generally system readiness
level (SRL), covering also integration of various technologies
− optimally, but not necessarily, it also outperforms competing innovations.
The following list presents examples for activities or products that may be considered
innovative compared to commercial state-of-the-art:
35Call: INNOVFUND-2024-BATT
EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
− a new product/service that requires more than incremental technical
adjustments in production facilities/supply chain or a new production set
up/plants
− a product service, process or business model substitution i.e. a new product,
service, process or business model that eliminates the need for existing
products, processes or business model.
− a new technology that can substitute an existing technology, or that allows the
novel integrated use of existing technology
− more than incremental adjustments in production facilities/supply chain that
enable intrinsically cleaner production, for instance making it possible to
substitute (totally or to a large extent) fossil fuel energy with renewable energy
− an existing technical solution or use applied in one sector is applied and more
incrementally adapted for a new sector or a different use
− system integration, i.e. an integration of existing technologies with lower system
integration readiness today.
Going beyond incremental innovation
The Innovation Fund aims to support projects that go beyond incremental innovation.
A more than incremental innovation requires overcoming major technological and/or
economic barriers, for instance by upscaling production processes or reducing
production costs by an order of magnitude.
In incremental innovation, the degree of innovation is very low since only minor
changes or improvements are made to existing products, processes or business models
(which result in e.g. reduction of costs or functional improvements in existing products,
services or processes at low levels of uncertainty). Incremental innovation does not
imply substantially new knowledge or technology. Since the Innovation Fund aims to
support projects with at least intermediate, possibly even higher degree of innovation,
projects which are likely to deliver only incremental innovation will not be retained.
Intermediate or strong degree of innovation is likely to be present in new or
considerably changed technologies or processes or business models for the production
or delivery of existing or new products or services. Furthermore, novel combinations of
mature technologies, the scale-up of innovative technologies and second (or more)
commercialisations may also fall under this category, if technological and/or economic
barriers need to be overcome to ensure the realisation of the project. Examples could
include, for instance, a lack of interoperability between mature technologies, a required
increase of the commercial readiness level, an adaptation of existing solutions to
fundamentally different markets. A strong degree of innovation is usually accompanied
by an increase of the overall TRL or SRL of key technologies.
Very strong or breakthrough degree of innovation is likely to be present in completely
new technologies or processes or business models or completely new products or
services, which substitute existing products or business models. Such innovation is
likely to lead to significant change that transforms entire markets or industries or
creates new ones and is characterised by high uncertainty. For such a level of
innovation, the projects usually overcome substantial technological and/or economical
barriers, for instance well-known technological limitations or unexpected cost
decreases, and are accompanied by a strong increase of the TRL of key technologies or
the SRL. A breakthrough innovation entails that the project is a first-of-a-kind
commercialisation.

Annex 2
Knowledge Sharing
Knowledge sharing aims to de-risk innovative technologies and solutions with regard to
scaling up to a commercial size, accelerating their deployment, and support their
replication, to increase the uptake and confidence in these technologies or solutions by
the investment community and wider public, as well as to maintain a competitive
market for their post-demonstration deployment. It also serves as a feedback tool to
the European Commission to overcome regulatory and financial barriers for the
innovative technologies under development.
As part of the knowledge sharing requirements incorporated into grant agreements,
Innovation Fund projects are required to actively share information with the public and
other market participants to ensure transparency and knowledge dissemination.
Beneficiaries must present the project on their websites and social media accounts.
Knowledge can be shared through the knowledge sharing reports, the GHG emission
avoidance reports, or communication and dissemination activities. Knowledge sharing
must cover the whole project cycle: reaching financial close; getting to entry into
operation; and operation. Relevant knowledge sharing areas include project
management, financial engineering, permitting, procurement, construction,
commissioning, performance, cost level and cost per unit performance, stakeholder
engagement, environmental impacts, health and safety, and further research and
development needs.
A more in-depth knowledge will be shared with all Innovation Fund projects of the same
sector or category and with any other project (from the specific sector or category) that
has agreed to share information on the same terms. Fair competition and commercial
sensitivity will be safeguarded during knowledge-sharing activities.
More general knowledge on the innovative technologies demonstrated under the
Innovation Fund will also be shared with a wider community beyond the circle of the
Innovation fund beneficiaries including Member States, researchers, NGOs,
international organisations and other projects.
Confidential (sensitive) information shared by the beneficiaries will be fully preserved.
Only anonymised and aggregated information will be shared with the public. Moreover,
no information will be disclosed which could lead to the reverse-engineering of the
beneficiaries’ technology or prejudge their ability to obtain patent or other registered
intellectual property right protection.

Annex 3
Minimum requirements for documentation on project funding support and
project contract terms
1. Project funding support
The purpose of the documents is to demonstrate credible commitment from project
stakeholders (project shareholders, project lenders or public entities) in the form of
preliminary agreements or letters of support with indicative terms and conditions (if
available). They should evidence the assumptions underlying the financing plan for the
project, as well as the state of progress made towards financial close.
Funding support by project shareholders (equity funding providers) can be evidenced
by memoranda of understanding, letters of intent or letters of support. The documents
should be signed by authorised signatories at executive committee and/or board of
director level of the funding entity.
If the proposal is expected to have low profitability as indicated by a negative project
net present value and for proposals falling under NZT-PILOTS topic, confirmation of
funding support from the project shareholders even in the presence of low/negative
profitability level and for this funding support to cover both the construction costs and
any negative operational cash flows is considered essential.
The documents provided should ideally include/confirm : the name of the funding
entity; job title of the signatory(ies); references to the project and investment scope
(aligned with the application project scope); project’s strategic importance; funding
amount and share of the total project’s investment scope (aligned with the description
in the proposal); availability of financing resources to secure the required funding
amount; expected timing and steps to reach final investment decision (if this
information is available).
Funding support by project lenders can be demonstrated by indicative term sheets
showing progress made towards securing financing from prospective lenders (if the
project is sufficiently close to the financial close target date).
For many projects, however, it is not expected that term sheets will be available at the
time of application. To evidence the credibility of the proposed debt financing,
applicants can submit letters of support from lending institutions with: the name of
lending institution; job title of the signatory(ies); specific reference to the project and
investment scope (aligned with the application project scope); role and level of
engagement of the lending institution in the project; endorsement of the project’s
strategic merits; indicative overall funding structure such as total debt amount, whether
debt will be raised at the level of the corporate entity or of the project, level of recourse
to the shareholders, ticket size, debt to equity ratio, expected tenor (if this information
is available and/or relevant at this stage); acknowledgment of target financial close and
preliminary indicative timeline to obtain credit approval and/or implement syndication.
Support by public entities can be demonstrated through letters of support from the
respective public entities with the following information: the name of official public
institution or authority (national or EU programme managing authority); job title of the
signatory(ies); specific reference to the project and investment scope (which must be
aligned with the application project scope); considered funding amount (EU funding or
national funding); if it is national funding please specify if is it State aid) and provide
the name of the funding programme; State aid notification status (if relevant); Target
financial close and indicative steps towards obtaining a formal funding decision.

EU Grants: Call document (INNOVFUND): V1.1 – 17.02.2025
Project funding support documents are recommended best practice to evidence the
credibility of the assumptions made in the application. Confirmation of funding support
from the project shareholders is essential for proposals with low profitability.
Documents which are either generic in nature or do not add meaningful support to
the credibility of the project maturity should not be attached to the application.
2. Project contract terms
Project contract terms — drafted in accordance with the minimum requirements set out
below; the documents should demonstrate the credibility of the business plan main
assumptions with pre-contractual terms from suppliers, off-takers, construction
companies and development partners (if and where relevant).
The purpose of these documents is to demonstrate credible commitment from project
counterparties (suppliers, off-takers, construction companies and development
partners) in the form of preliminary agreements or letters of support with indicative
terms and conditions (if available). They should evidence the assumptions underlying
the business plan, as well as the state of progress made towards financial close.
Support by counterparties can be evidenced by memoranda of understanding, letters
of intent or letters of support. The documents should be signed by authorised
signatories of the counterparty entities concerned.
For joint development preliminary contract terms (if the project is developed
jointly by multiple parties), the documents provided should ideally include/confirm:
specific reference to the project and investment scope (aligned with the application
project scope); key terms of cooperation between the parties; role repartition; cost
allocation and approval responsibility; decision making procedures (for instance
establishment of steering committee); acknowledgment of target financial close,
conditions for final investment decision (including indicative timing of steps and
milestones); Entry into force and expiry of the preliminary development agreement.
For Off-take/supply/construction preliminary contract terms, the documents
provided should ideally include/confirm: specific reference to the project and
investment scope (aligned with the application project scope); the name of off-
take/supply/construction counterparty; type and scope of off-take/supply/construction
works (for off-take including sector of product or service); off-take/supply volume;
pricing indication or quote; duration of agreement; entry into force and expiry of
preliminary agreement.
Documents which are either generic in nature or do not add meaningful support to
the credibility of the project maturity should not be attached to the application.

the GHG calculations also for small-scale projects.
o Energy storage technologies for mobility applications are now
covered under the new category mobility (MOB) in section 5.
o Section 4.1 has been streamlined and aligned with the
provisions in section 1. The text now clarifies that the exclusion
of simultaneous charging and discharging only applies to the
same type of energy.
o In section 4.3, the distinction between inputs to energy storage
and on-site energy consumption has been clarified by
introducing differing subscripts. Equation [4.1] and [4.2] have
been adapted to the general provisions on absolute GHG
emissions avoidance in section 1.
o The methodology for manufacturing of innovative energy
storage systems and their components has been separated in
4EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025

aircrafts, maritime vessels, road vehicles and their components,
including fuel cells and energy storage components for mobility
applications.
▪ The section on CCU/S credit has been renumbered from section 3
to section 6 and has been streamlined and clarified.
o Equation 6.1 has been reframed on a single year rather than
over the sum of project years (section 6.5).
o Equations have been added in a footnote to section 6.5 to
clarify the case that a CC credit must be included in the
reference scenario.
▪ A dedicated section for proposals submitted under the
INNOVFUND-2024-BATT call has been created as section 7.
4.1 15.12.2024 ▪ Updated the emission factor for EV use phase (relevant for relative
and total GHG avoidance) for the INNOVFUND-2024-BATT call.
4.2 01.04.2025 ▪ In section 1.1.7, page 19, clarified the treatment of emissions due
to the manufacturing process in the case of projects manufacturing
innovative technologies and their components.
▪ Corrected a typo in the unit of measure of term Pout,y in Section
3.3.1.1, page 93. The quantity Pout,y must be expressed in
megawatt (MW) to ensure dimensional consistency in equations
3.3, 3.4, 3.5.
▪ Clarified the units of measure to be used in equation 4.4a, page
104. The term EFout, natural gas must be expressed in tonnes CO2
equivalent per terajoule (tCO2e/TJ) and the conversion factor
0.0036 is introduced in equation 4.4a to ensure dimensional
consistency. A related example in section 4.1.2, page 101, was
also clarified accordingly.

1 Introduction and general provisions
The methodology for the calculation of the GHG emission avoidance for projects submitted
under the call “Innovation Fund Call for proposals 2024 Net Zero Technologies”
(INNOVFUND-2024-NZT) is described in the following sections and in the appendixes to
this document:
Section 1: Introduction and general provisions.
Section 2: Energy intensive industries (EII), including substitute products, carbon
capture and utilisation (CCU), and manufacturing of electrolysers and their components.
Section 3: Renewable energy (RES), including manufacturing of components for RES.
Section 4: Energy storage (ES), including manufacturing of components for ES.
Section 5: Mobility (MOB), including manufacturintg of innovative ships, aircraft, road
vehicles and their components.
Section 6: Credit for carbon capture and storage or utilisation.
Projects that apply under the call “Innovation Fund Call for proposals 2024 Batteries”
(INNOVFUND-2024-BATT) must calculate their GHG emissions following the provisions in
Section 7, as the provisions in the rest of this document do not apply to them.
When deciding under which call to submit an application, the applicant should carefully
review the eligibility conditions detailed in the call text of each call.
Each methodology section provides the details to be used when:
• calculating the GHG emission avoidance potential of a project at the application
stage;
• reporting performance for the purposes of disbursement of the portion of the grant
that is linked to GHG emission avoidance verification; and
• reporting performance for the purposes of knowledge-sharing.1
0F
Definitions of terms used within the methodology for the INNOVFUND-2024-NZT call are
provided in Appendix 5.
1.1 GHG emission avoidance: principles and scope
For the purpose of the Innovation Fund, the GHG emission avoidance of a project is
calculated in terms of absolute GHG emission avoidance (section 1.1.3), and relative GHG
emission avoidance (section 1.1.4).
The InnovFund grant disbursement depends on verified emission reductions. Therefore, it
is important that the emissions reductions described in the application can be delivered.
For example, when forecasting operational data, applicants should consider any expected
ramping up period, e.g., if reduced performance can be expected over the first years of
operation due to necessary stops and starts of the production for technical adjustments,
this should be reflected in the calculations.
The final split of products and expected functions for those products needs to be clearly
identified. If the application claims that a product will be used for a specific purpose this
1 These parameters will be reported through a dedicated knowledge-sharing report template once projects
enter into operation. The detailed knowledge-sharing requirements are specified in the Model Grant
Agreement, call text and knowledge-sharing reporting template.
13EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
should be credibly demonstrated, for example by providing draft contracts or other relevant
supporting documents.
In the case that the share of products or their use during project implementation differs
from the products and uses specified in the application, or that other assumptions made
at the application stage cannot be demonstrated during project implementation, the project
may not be able to reach the GHG emission avoidance claimed at the time of the
1F
application, with potential implications on grant disbursement as specified in the Call Text
(see also section 1.1.9 and sction 1.5).
It is a fundamental principle of the Methodology for GHG Emission Avoidance Calculation
that each GHG emission and each GHG saving shall only be counted once ('no double
counting' principle). In any case in which the other provisions in this methodology may
seem to call for a given emission or saving to be counted twice, the ‘no double counting’
principle prevails. If the applicants believes that they have identified such a case, the
applicant should consider seeking clarification via the InnovFund helpdesk.
1.1.1 Key steps for the calculation of the GHG emissions avoidance
The following six steps approach outlines the key stages applicants have to go through for
calculating the GHG emissions avoidance of a project.
Figure 1.1. The step by step of the GHG GHG calculation
1.1.1.1 Step 1: Understanding your project
The first step for an applicant is to understand their project, what practice or product they
intend to replace – does it refer to a change in the process, or a replacement of the final
product? What are the parties involved in the implementation?
For instance, a project could propose to produce an innovative fuel for transport
applications. Alternatively, a project may focus on the use of an alternative fuel in an
innovative vessel or aircraft, or can include both the production and the use of the fuel.
It is very important to have clarity on the scope of the project, and to thoroughly check
the eligibility conditions established in the Call Text for each topic.
1.1.1.2 Step 2: Classify your project and identify your methodology
Then, the applicant need to identify the category and sector under which their project falls.
A project must be classified according to the principal product that is the main aim of
the project, following the provisions in section 1.2. A correct definition of the principal
product that is the main aim of the project is the key for a correct identification of the
sector under which the application shall be submitted, as well as the category.
Once the project has been classified, the applicant can use Table 1.1 in section 1.2 to
identify which section(s) of the GHG methodology they have to follow, in addition to the
general guidance provided under section 1 of this document. Each section includes
instructions, provisions, and/or readymade equations for applicants to use to calculate the
GHG emission avoidance of their project.
14EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Note that some projects may have more than one principal product (section 1.2.2) and
some projects may have principal products associated to more than one category (hybrid
projects, section 1.2.5).
Refer also to section 1.3.1 for projects aiming at manufacturing innovative technologies
and their components and to section 5.1.1 for MOB projects.
1.1.1.3 Step 3: Understand GHG emissions covered & boundaries of GHG Calculation
Once the relevant methodology section(s) has been identified, the applicant must
thoroughly review it to understand the provisions that apply to the category and sector of
their project.
Then, the applicant must define the project boundaries for the purpose of GHG emission
avoidance calculations, in line with the relevant provisions in the Methodology and as a
function of the specificities of the proposed project.
The applicant shall take into consideration that the definition of the project boundaries is
closely linked to the project classification and principal product definition, so applicants
may need to review and confirm the previous steps accordingly, while going through step
3.
Refer to section 1.1.2 to define the time period considered for GHG emission avoidance
calculations, to section 1.1.6, 1.1.7, 1.1.8 for GHG emissions and additional non-CO2
climate impacts that are generally included or excluded from the scope of this
methodology, and to the relevant sub-sections of the methodology to understand the
boundaries of the GHG emission avoidance calculations: section 2.2.3 for EII projects,
section 3.2for RES projects, section 4.2 for ES projects, section 5.2 for MOB projects.
Refer also to section 1.3 for projects aiming at manufacturing innovative technologies and
their components, and to section 6 for projects including a component of CCS or CCU.
1.1.1.4 Step 4: Reference Scenario identification
The emission avoidance of a project is calculated in terms of absolute GHG emission
avoidance (section 1.1.3), and relative GHG emission avoidance (section 1.1.4) by
comparing the emissions in the project scenario to the emissions in the reference scenario.
The reference scenario is a hypothetical scenario that represents what would have occurred
in the absence of the project as further detailed in section 1.4.1.
The applicant must select the reference scenario in line with the provisions of the
Methodology. Often, the choice of the reference scenario is mandated by the Methodology,
and the applicant cannot further adapt the scenario prescribed.
The applicant must thoroughly review and apply the relevant provisions under each section
of the methodology as applicable to the category and sector of your project. In particular:
section 2.2.4 for EII projects, section 3.2.1 for RES projects, section 4 for ES projects, and
section 5.1.2 for MOB projects.
1.1.1.5 Step 5: Complete the GHG Calculators
Once the reference scenario is defined, applicants shall perform their GHG calculations
following the relevant section(s) of the methodology adequate for the category and sector
of the project, as specified in Table 1.1 in section 1.2, in addition to the general provisions
in section 1.
To perform their GHG calculations, the applicant must duly fill-in the relevant GHG
calculator(s). GHG calculators are spreadsheet templates available on the Call application
webpage, which the applicant must complete and submit as part of their application
15EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
documents. The applicants must also complete the “data traceability” section of the GHG
calculator(s), as part of the Monitoring Reporting and Verification requirements for
Innovation Fund projects, as detailed in section 1.5 and Annex 4 to this document.
Since applicants are allowed to upload only one spreadsheet at the application stage, for
the case of hybrid projects (section 1.2.5), the applicant needs to combine two or more
GHG calculators into one single file, following the instructions in section 1.2.5.1.
In addition to completing the GHG calculator, the applicant must complete the relevant
application forms, and provide a detailed explanation of the calculations performed and a
credible justification of the assumptions taken. This includes providing adequate
justification and explanation as to how the proposed project meets the relevant minimum
requirements as specified in the Call Text. The applicant should provide additional
supporting documents where relevant and ensure that the information encoded across
different application documents are consistent.
It is recommended that applicants review the relevant training materials, tutorials, and
examples available on the Innovation Fund webpage.
1.1.1.6 Step 6: Upload GHG calculator to the portal
Once the GHG calculator is completed, the applicant shall upload it on the application portal
along with the other application documents.
1.1.2 Time period considered for GHG calculations
The GHG emission avoidance of a project is calculated over a period of 10 years after the
entry into operation of the project. In the case that the project operates for less than
10 years, operational data will be set to zero for those years in which the project does not
operate. As such, both ∆GHG and ∆GHG shall reflect the reduced period of operation of
abs rel
the project.
The minimum duration of the monitoring and reporting period is specified in the Call Text
and depends on the topic under which the project is submitted. Note that the duration of
the monitoring and reporting period may be shorter with respect to the period of 10 years
over which the GHG emission avoidance of a project is calculated at the application stage.
1.1.3 Absolute GHG emission avoidance
The absolute GHG emission avoidance represents the difference, over a defined period,
between all the emissions that would occur in the reference scenario, i.e., in the
absence of the proposed project, and all the emissions that occur in the project scenario.
Note that, in the calculation of the absolute and relative GHG emission avoidance, it is
necessary to include all the emissions both in the reference and project scenario. This
includes “common” emissions that are the same in both scenarios. If “common” emissions
would be excluded from both scenarios, then the relative emission calculation would be
distorted.
The absolute GHG emission avoidance shall be calculated based on the expected emissions
avoided in each year from the entry into operation over a 10-year period, as defined in
section 1.1.2, using the equation below.
10
∆GHG =∑(Ref − Proj +CC ) [1.1]
abs y y credity
y=1
Where:
16EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
∆GHG = Net absolute GHG emissions avoided due to operation of the project during the first 10
abs
years of operation, in tCO2e.
Ref
𝑦
= GHG emissions that would occur in the absence of the project in year y, in tCO2e.
Proj
𝑦
= GHG emissions in the project scenario in year y, in tCO2e.
CC = credit for storage or utilisation of captured CO , calculated in accordance with
credity 2
section 6.
y = year of the operation of the project.
For projects with multiple principal products and for hybrid projects, Ref and Proj represent
y y
the sum of the reference emissions and project emissions across all principal products and
categories, respectively. For the case of hybrid projects, this will require adding together
reference emissions and project emissions calculated using different sections of this
methodology (see section 1.2.5).
1.1.4 Relative GHG emission avoidance
The relative GHG emission avoidance potential shall be calculated by dividing the
absolute emission avoidance (∆GHG ) by the reference emissions (Ref ) cumulated over a
abs y
10-year period, using the equation below, and subject to the additional conditions detailed
in this sub-section.
∆GHG
abs
∆GHG rel = ∑10 (Ref ) [1.2]
𝑦=1 𝑦
Where:
∆GHG = Relative GHG emissions avoided due to operation of the project over the first 10 years of
rel
operation, in percent.
∆GHG = Net absolute GHG emissions avoided due to operation of the project during the first 10
abs
years of operation, in tCO2e.
Ref
𝑦
= GHG emissions that would occur in the absence of the project in year y, in tCO2e.
The relative GHG emission avoidance of a project cannot be negative. In case the absolute
GHG emission avoidance of a project is zero or negative, the relative GHG emission
avoidance shall be set to zero. In the unusual case in which a project has zero or negative
cumulated reference emissions, but the absolute GHG emission avoidance of the project is
positive, equation [1.2] cannot be used and the relative GHG emission avoidance shall be
set as 100%. This includes projects that consist only of direct air capture of CO , capture
2
of naturally released CO , or CO capture at an existing bioenergy plant without expansion
2 2
of the capacity of the plant, for the purpose of permanent storage.
Note that all the projects must meet the relevant minimum requirement in terms of relative
GHG emission avoidance, as specified in the Call Text.
1.1.5 Net carbon removals
To be considered a net carbon removals project, the project must deliver net negative
emissions excluding any credit for timed operation (section 2.2.6.6) and for non-
principal products (section 2.2.10), i.e. ∑10 (Proj − CC −TO −Proj )<
𝑦=1 𝑦 credity 𝑦 non−principaly
0, where TO is the emission credit associated with timed operation in year y, and
𝑦
Proj is the emission credit associated with production of non-principal products in
non−principal
year y.
17EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
In order to claim net carbon removal, projects that meet the abovementioned threshold
must calculate an adjusted relative GHG emission avoidance by removing any contribution
from timed operation. Negative emissions from non-principal products shall be included in
calculation of this adjusted relative emissions avoidance score, however, they cannot be
the only source of negative emissions for a project claiming net carbon removals. The
adjusted relative GHG emission avoidance ∆̂GHG is therefore calculated using the equation
rel
below, and subject to the additional conditions detailed in this sub-section.
∆GHG +∑10 (TO )
∆̂GHG = abs 𝑦=1 𝑦 [1.3]
rel ∑10 (Ref )
𝑦=1 𝑦
The adjusted relative GHG emission avoidance of a project cannot be negative. In case the
value at the numerator is negative, the adjusted relative GHG emission avoidance shall be
set to zero. In the unusual case in which a project has zero or negative cumulated reference
emissions, but the value at the numerator is positive, equation [1.3] cannot be used and
the adjusted relative GHG emission avoidance shall be set as 100%, if the quantity
∑10 (Proj − CC −TO −Proj ) is positive, or to 200%, if the quantity
𝑦=1 𝑦 credity 𝑦 non−principaly
∑10 (Proj − CC −TO −Proj ) is negative. The latter situation includes
𝑦=1 𝑦 credity 𝑦 non−principaly
projects that consist only of direct air capture of CO , capture of naturally released CO , or
2 2
CO capture at an existing bioenergy plant without expansion of the capacity of the plant,
2
for the purpose of permanent storage, for which an adjusted relative GHG emission
avoidance of 200% always applies.
1.1.6 GHG considered and global warming potentials
The greenhouse gases that must be taken into account in emissions calculations shall be
those listed in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Directive 2003/87/EC, Annex II:
carbon dioxide (CO ), methane (CH ), nitrous oxide (N O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
2 4 2
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF ).
6
Emission factors for all greenhouse gases shall be expressed in terms of CO equivalent
2
emissions on the basis of 100-year global warming potentials. The global warming
potentials (GWPs) to be used are those in the Annex to the Commission Delegated
Regulation supplementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of
the Council with regard to values for GWPs and the inventory guidelines and with regard
to the Union inventory system and repealing Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No
666/2014.2
2F
The methodology is structured with the intention of capturing the most common emission
sources. However, some GHG emissions are generally excluded from the scope of this
methodology (see section 1.1.7).
Examples of emissions that may occur in stages in the lifecycle, and are included within
the scope of this methodology (non-exhaustive list):
• Emissions of non-CO greenhouse gases (e.g., methane and nitrous oxide) due to
2
3F
fuel combustion (including from combustion of renewable fuels),
• Emissions of non-CO greenhouse gases resulting from chemical processes such as
2
refrigerant manufacture.

18EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
1.1.7 GHG emission sources that are generally excluded and may be considered as “other
GHG savings”
Generally, the following emissions are excluded for all projects unless specified otherwise.
These shall not be considered in the calculation of absolute and relative GHG
emissions avoidance.
• Emissions from capital goods (e.g. manufacture of machinery and equipment) and
emissions during construction.
• Emissions due to extraction, processing, refining, distribution and storage of fossil
fuels that are combusted for energy production by the project (or otherwise
consumed to release their chemical energy, e.g. in a fuel cell) are excluded from
the calculation in both the reference and project scenario. This allows aligning to
the methodology for calculating the EU ETS benchmarks, which considers only
combustion emissions of fossil fuels.
• Fugitive CO and CH emissions due to well testing and well bleeding in geothermal
2 4
power plants.
• Avoidance of methane emissions from alternative disposal of biomass inputs (e.g.,
their diversion from landfill).
• Indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions from supply of crops, and consideration
of carbon debt in forestry.
• Emissions related to decommissioning of the plants and machinery at the end of
life.
• Emissions related to employee commuting, business travels and waste generation
at the administrative offices.
• Emissions due to the manufacturing process in the case of projects manufacturing
innovative technologies and their components, when they are classified in one of
the sectors specified in section 1.3.1.
• Emissions associated with the transport of raw materials, inputs, intermediate
products between sites within the system boundary, process waste sent to
treatment, and distribution of final products shall not be considered in either the
project or reference scenario, unless otherwise specified in section 1.4.5.
Should there be substantial GHG emissions savings from emission sources excluded from
the scope of this methodology, the applicant can provide a separate calculation of potential
emission savings, which may be claimed separately as “other GHG savings”. These shall
not be added to the calculation of absolute and relative GHG emissions avoidance.
Note that some emissions are included within the scope of this methodology, even if they
are assigned an emission factor equal to zero. In such cases, the applicants cannot claim
“other GHG savings” associated to these emission sources. For example, this is the case of
biogenic CO2 emissions from biomass-derived fuels and materials as specified in section
1.4.4, and emissions associated to the electricity consumed by a project, as specified in
section 1.4.3.
The specific assumptions taken, and the approach used for the calculation of “other GHG
savings” should, as far as possible, be consistent with the principles of the Methodology.
Applicants shall not selectively choose assumptions and emission factors to inflate emission
avoidance claims. Instead, they should use more realistic alternatives that align with the
principles of the Methodology.
19EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
1.1.8 Additional non-CO climate impacts associated with maritime and aviation activities
2
Maritime and aviation activities are associated with significant non-CO climate impacts in
2
addition to the non-CO greenhouse gases identified in section 1.1.6. These additional non-
2
CO climate impacts derive mostly from emissions by aircraft of water vapour, formation
2
of contrails (condensation trails) and cloudiness in the wake of aircraft, nitrogen oxides
(NOx), soot particles and oxidised sulphur species, and releases of black carbon from
vessels.
The significance of these additional non-CO climate impacts has been confirmed, and shall
2
be characterised in terms of GWP on a 100-year basis and counted towards absolute GHG
emission avoidance for maritime and aviation projects following the provisions in section
5.
1.1.9 Assumptions and data sources
To support the calculation of reference and project emissions, and for those parameters
that are not prescribed by this Methodology, applicants may need to adopt assumptions to
predict operational performance. Applicants should select assumptions that lead to the
most accurate possible estimate of activity data (e.g. energy production or consumption),
operational performance and resulting GHG emissions. Every assumption adopted in the
calculations shall be justified and underpinned with adequate references to verifiable
sources of information. In addition, the operational assumptions adopted for the purposes
of GHG calculations shall be consistent with those adopted in the rest of the proposals.
Failure to provide adequate justification, or the use of assumptions that deliberately give
an unduly favourable result may adversely affect the quality of the GHG emission avoidance
calculations, and the evaluation of the project. In addition, the applicants must propose
adequate monitoring measures in their monitoring plan (see section 1.5 and Appendix 4)
to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting of the assumptions made at the application
stage. Failure to provide an adequate monitoring plan may negatively affect the quality of
the GHG calculations, and the resulting evaluation.
During project implementation, failure to demonstrate that the assumptions made at the
application stage are representative of the actual operation of the project, may affect the
overall GHG emission avoidance that can be achieved, which may have consequences in
terms of grant disbursement as specified in the Call Text.
The Methodology provides additional guidance on the selection of relevant assumptions in
the following sections, where relevant and depending on the type of project. For example,
section 1.3.6 provides specific guidance for projects manufacturing innovative technologies
and their components, and section 1.4.4 provides specific guidance on biomass-derived
fuels and materials. In addition, Appendix 1 provides specific guidance for the selection of
GHG emissions intensities and combustion emissions, when those parameters are not
specified in the relevant section of the methodology, and need to be sourced from the
literature, which is particularly relevant for the case of Energy Intensive Industry (EII)
projects (section 2).
1.2 Principal products and specification of a sector for the purpose of the GHG
emission avoidance calculations
When submitting the application, the applicant needs to identify the principal products that
the project will produce and choose the sector under which the project falls accordingly
(see Table 1.1). Note that this choice may influence the outcome of the evaluation, see
the call text for details. The sector shall be determined based on the function of the
principal product or service that is the main aim of the project.
Table 1.1 provides an overview of sector classification associated with possible principal
products or services and provides an indication of the section of the methodology to follow
20EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
for the GHG emission avoidance calculation of a given type of project. The sector must be
chosen from the list provided, but the principal product that is the main aim of the project
may not be explicitly listed. The applicant should therefore specify this principal product in
the application. For example, a project in the sector ‘glass, ceramics and construction
material’ may specify its principal product as ‘shatterproof glass’ rather than identifying
one of the more generic products listed below.

1.2.1 Choice of a principal product and a reference product
In some cases, the conventional product that will be replaced by a principal product from
a project could have uses in more than one sector. For example, some products could be
used either as chemicals under sector EII/Chemicals, or could be used as fuel under sector
EII/Refineries. In such cases, the applicant must choose the sector associated with the
most common use of the principal product that is the main aim of the project unless the
project includes specific actions and tasks related to the use of the produced product in
less common application. Similarly, in calculating the emissions in the reference scenario
for each principal product (see section 1.4.1), the applicant must determine the appropriate
emission factor based on the most common use of the product, unless the project includes
specific actions and tasks related to the use of the product in a less common application.
Example: The sole product of a project is ethanol, and the project does not involve
specific actions and tasks, nor investments, related to the use of ethanol as a
chemical. The main market for ethanol in the EU is as transport fuel, and therefore
the applicant must apply in the sector EII/refineries rather than EII/chemicals. The
reference scenario emissions shall be determined in accordance with EII Case 4
(transport fuel substitutes).
In some cases, a principal product from a project may be physically different (including
having a different chemical composition) to the conventional product that it will replace
(the reference product). In such cases, the innovative product may not be listed in Table
1.1, but the conventional product that the project aims to replace will often be. In these
cases, the relevant sector associated to the substituted product shall be chosen for the
application. The applicant must clearly specify the principal product and the associated
reference product. The reference emissions will be determined by the product that is being
replaced. In such cases applicants must credibly demonstrate the claimed use of the
24EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
product, for example by providing draft contracts, letters of intent from the buyers, or
other relevant supporting documents.
Example: A project produces a novel biomass-based packaging material and the
applicant states that it will replace polystyrene in packaging applications. The
category/sector/reference product for the application will be
EII/chemicals/polystyrene with a reference scenario based on polystyrene
production. The applicant must credibly demonstrate that the packaging product
will replace polystyrene in practice.
In cases where the product that is the main aim of the project could potentially replace
either a physically similar11 conventional product or a physically different conventional
12F
product, the applicant must determine the sector based on the sector of the physically
similar conventional product unless the project includes specific actions and tasks related
to the use of the product to substitute a physically different product. Similarly, in
calculating reference scenario emissions for each principal product (see section 1.4.1) the
applicant must determine the appropriate emission factor based on production of the
physically similar conventional product unless the project includes specific actions and
tasks related to the use of the product to substitute a physically different product.
Example: A project produces a cardboard product, and the applicant states that it
could be used to replace PVC products in a specified application. If the project
includes specific actions and tasks and investments related to setting up and
operating a manufacturing plant to use the cardboard product in that PVC
application, then the application may be submitted in the category/sector
EII/Chemicals with a reference scenario based on PVC production. If the project
does not include specific actions, tasks, and investments of this sort, then the
application must be submitted in the category/sector EII/Pulp & paper.
During project implementation, copies of contracts will have to be submitted to ensure that
the claims made with respect to the intended use of the product and the related GHG
emission avoidance are verified. If the project does not reach the expected GHG emissions
avoidance due to a change in the use of the product, this may have implications on grant
disbursement.
1.2.2 Choice of a sector when there is more than one principal product
The application may only be submitted for one sector. However, some applications
may produce multiple products associated to more than one sector, and potentially
associated to multiple categories. For such projects, the applicant must therefore choose
the appropriate sector for the application based on the principal product or products that
represent the main aim of the project, as explained below. The other ‘co-principal’ products
do not affect the choice of sector. Note that projects that include principal products
associated to more than one category are referred to as hybrid projects (see section
1.2.5).
In case of a project will earn revenues from the sale of a single principal product that
substitutes a similar conventional product, it is straightforward to choose the sector
according to the single principal product.
11 A physically similar conventional product is a conventional product with a similar or identical chemical
composition and similar or identical physical properties.
25EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Example: The sole product of the project is steel produced in an innovative way to
substitute traditional steel production. The principal product is steel and the relevant
sector to choose is the steel sector under EII/Iron and Steel.
Example: If a project intends to generate electricity through installation of
photovoltaic panels, the relevant sector to choose is RES/Solar energy.
In the case that a project will earn revenues from the sale of several products, the
applicant shall define as ‘principal product(s)’ at least the set of products that generate the
bulk of the revenues from a project. Other products may be identified as principal or non-
principal at the discretion of the applicant. The conventional products substituted by the
13F
principal products must be included in the reference scenario for the GHG emissions
calculation, whereas non-principal products are included in the project scenario only.
From the set of principal products, one must be chosen that reflects the main aim and
innovation of the project. This product will determine the sector for the application. The
main aim should be identified primarily by considering the revenues from the products or
services that the project will produce or deliver, but the applicant should also consider to
which product(s) the main innovation introduced by the project is relateds to. In some
cases, the revenue and innovation in a project will be evenly distributed across products
in more than one sector – in those cases, the applicant may choose which sector to apply
in.
Example: A steel producer proposes a project to modify its existing plant in order
to produce ethanol from carbon monoxide in the flue gas in addition to steel
products. Ethanol will be sold as an alternative transport fuel for blending in gasoline
for road transport. Both steel and ethanol are identified as principal products. The
applicant must therefore decide whether to apply in the sector ‘EII/Iron and steel’
or in the sector ‘EII/Refineries’.
In a project of this sort, the produced steel will normally represent a larger revenue stream
than the produced ethanol. The main innovation introduced by the project, however, may
lay in the conversion of flue gas carbon monoxide to ethanol. In this case, therefore, it
may be appropriate for the applicant to identify the ethanol as the product that is the main
aim of the project and apply in the sector EII/refineries, even though it does not represent
the largest revenue stream for the modified facility. In any case, this choice must be well
justified in the application documents.
1.2.3 CCU/S projects
In case of CCS projects that include the facility from which the CO is captured within the
2
system boundary of the project, the principal product must be set as the main output of
the facility.
Example: A carbon capture unit is added to an existing steel production plant. The
principal product and main aim of the project is steel and the relevant sector is
EII/Iron and Steel.
Projects for which the main aim is CCS based on direct air capture or capture of naturally
released geological CO , in which CO is captured from the atmosphere or from a naturally
2 2
occurring geological source, rather than from an industrial process, shall apply under
category “EII” and sector “other” with the principal product identified as “CO storage” (see
2
also section 2.2.4.7).
Projects that will transport and/or geologically store CO captured outside the system
2
boundary shall apply under category “EII” and sector “other” with the principal product(s)
identified as “CO transport” and/or “CO storage” (see also section 2.2.4.8, and section
2 2
6.2).
26EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
For projects including a CCU component, the sector shall be determined by consideration
of the principal product that is the main aim of the project. If both the process from which
the CO is captured and the carbon utilisation process are within the system boundary of
2
the project, then at least one of the products from the process from which the CO is
2
captured and at least one CCU product must be identified as principal products of the
project, and the applicant must determine from these the product that is the main of the
project following the guidance in section 1.2.2 above.
Example: A carbon capture unit is added to an existing steel production plant and
the captured CO is used in plastic production. Both the steel plant and the plastic
2
production plant are within the system boundary of the project. Both steel and
plastic must be treated as principal products. The main aim and therefore the sector
of the project must be determined by considering the main innovation and sources
of revenue for the project.
If the CO capture occurs outside the boundaries of the project, and the CO is brought in
2 2
as an input, then one of the CCU products shall be identified as the principal product that
is the main aim of the project. In case of multiple CCU products, the guidance in section
1.2.2 above applies.
Example: A project sources captured CO from outside the system boundaries
2
for it to be used in plastic production. The principal product and main aim of the
project is plastic, and the relevant sector is EII/Chemicals.
Note that in the case that CO is captured for utilisation from a project in the RES or MOB
2
categories , then the CCU product(s) produced will normally fall under the EII category,
and a hybrid RES/EII or MOB/EII application may be required (see section 1.2.5).
See section 6 for additional guidance on the calculation of the carbon capture credit. See
section 2.2.5.2 for additional guidance on EII projects with a component of CCS, and
section 2.2.5.3 for additional guidance on EII projects with a component of CCU.
1.2.4 Buildings
This sub-section applies to projects focusing on innovative solutions that reduce GHG
emissions in Buildings (BIL). Such projects shall apply the general provisions outlined in
section 1 and in the Annexes as relevant. In addition, such projects should refer to the
chapters of the methodology that best correspond to their project activity, namely: EII
(section 2), RES (section 3), or ES (section 4).
For example, a project that intends to produce electricity and/or heat for use in buildings
should use section 3 of the Methodology if the heat or electricity produced or used is of
renewable origin, including bio-origin. Conversely, the project should use section 2 of the
methodology if the heat or electricity is of a different origin. In addition, a project that
intends to produce innovative construction materials for use in buildings should apply
section 2 of the methodology.
The list of examples in this section is not exhaustive.
1.2.5 Hybrid projects
When a project combines activities related to more than one category, such as EII, RES,
ES, MOB, this will be considered a hybrid project. In such cases, the applicant shall still
choose a main sector and associated principal product that best corresponds to the main
aim of the project (see 1.2.2).
Example: a hybrid project involves installation of a large wind power generation
facility coupled to an electrolyser producing hydrogen. The export of electricity, in
excess to the electricity used by the electrolyser, is anticipated to generate ten
times as much revenue as the sale of hydrogen and the integration of the two
27EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
installations is innovative in terms of process and technology. The applicant should
choose wind energy as the main sector.
If, however, the project’s innovation is related only to the electrolyser and is not
related to the wind farm, nor the integration between the two facilities, then it would
not be appropriate to make a hybrid application. The applicant may instead consider
making an application for the electrolyser only under the energy intensive industries
or energy storage categories (i.e. considering hydrogen as the principal product and
treating electricity production as out of scope).
In cases where the expected revenues for products in different sectors under a potential
hybrid project are comparable (i.e. cases where a lower-revenue product would generate
at least 70% of the expected revenue of the highest-revenue product) and the innovation is
associated with a lower revenue product, the applicant may choose the main sector based
on the more innovative product rather than the product with the highest revenue share.
The applicant shall then clearly identify the distinct parts in the project relating to the
relevant categories so that the calculations follow the respective sections of the
methodology.
1.2.5.1 Calculation of GHG emission avoidance for hybrid projects
Hybrid projects may involve elements of any two or more of the categories EII, RES, ES
and MOB. Such hybrid projects should combine the various components and clarify the
system boundaries for each part. The GHG emissions from each component need to be
then summed up while removing double counting. The following sub-sections 1.2.5.2 to
1.2.5.5 provide specific guidance on some more common combinations.
Hybrid projects shall calculate their reference emissions and their project emissions by
summing up the single components calculated according to the relevant sections of the
methodology (e.g., EII, RES, ES, MOB)while removing double counting of avoidance and/or
emissions, if any. Then, the absolute GHG emission avoidance is calculated as the
difference between the cumulated reference emissions, and the cumulated project
emissions, while the relative GHG emission avoidance is calculated as the cumulated
absolute GHG emission avoidance divided by the cumulated reference emissions.
Since applicants are allowed to upload only one spreadsheet at the application stage, for
the case of hybrid projects, the applicant needs to combine two or more GHG calculators
into one single file. For instance, for an hybrid EII + RES application the applicant shall
add a copy of the tabs 'Reference emissions RES', 'Project emissions RES' and “Conversion
factors RES” from the RES GHG Calculator into the EII GHG Calculator. If the project
involves other categories such as storages or MOB, then the file shall include a copy of the
“Reference emissions”, “Project emissions” and “Conversion factors” tabs from the
corresponding GHG Calculator as well. There is no need to duplicate the remaining tabs,
e.g. for 'Assumptions', 'Net carbon removals', etc. Applicants can fill all the required
information in one single version of the tab.
Note that, after filling in the project data, calculating the GHG emissions in the reference
and project scenario for each of the project categories, and removing any double counted
emissions, applicants shall adjust the links to other tabs in the “Summary per year” sheet,
to ensure they capture the total reference emissions and project emissions from all the
relevant categories. The formulas in the “Net carbon removals” sheet may also need to be
adjusted, while the formulas in the “Summary” sheet should not be modified.
1.2.5.2 Energy intensive industries (EII) and renewable energy (RES) projects
For a project including EII and RES parts, the applicant should consider submitting a hybrid
application. A typical case could be a project that proposes an innovative EII installation
coupled with a RES generation plant, which will both supply power to the EII installation
and export excess power to the grid. In this situation, only the portion of electricity
28EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
exported to the grid can be claimed as part of the RES calculations, and result in additional
emission savings.
Projects generating energy from partly biogenic resources (such as waste-to-energy plants
where the consumed waste is partly biogenic) must make hybrid applications considering
the renewable/biogenic part under RES and the non-renewable/non-biogenic part under
EII. For projects involving carbon capture, refer also to the examples provided in section
6.4.
Applicants should pay particular attention to use in the calculation of the correct emission
factor for electricity for each part of the project. An applicant should use the appropriate
RES EF value from Table 1.3 in section 1.4.3.1 for the net electricity (dispatchable or not)
exported from the RES part of the project, even if the hybrid project application is
submitted for an EII sector as its main sector. The emissions accounting of EII and RES
parts follows the principle of “adding up while removing double counting”.
Example: A project proposes a hydrogen electrolyser, with principal product
hydrogen, combined with an on-site wind energy farm. During wind peaks, the
project plans to export half of the power to the grid. The project can be submitted
as a hybrid project with an EII part (EII/hydrogen) and a RES part (RES/wind
energy). Only the portion of electricity exported to the grid can be included as part
of the RES calculations.
Conversely, in case all the renewable energy will be used in the production of
hydrogen with no electricity export, then the calculation follows only the EII section,
and the project does not need to be considered as hybrid.
For a hybrid EII+RES project, the applicant shall demonstrate that the power from the RES
part will be preferentially supplied to local use in the EII part with only the remainder
exported.
Example: A project intends building a RES facility that supplies 100% of its power
to the grid and it is co-located in an EII facility. In such a case the applicant may
consider submitting two separate funding applications for the RES and EII facilities,
but cannot submit a hybrid application.
1.2.5.3 Energy intensive industries (EII) and energy storage (ES) projects
A project that includes energy storage in an EII plant should split the GHG calculation into
two contributions based on the energy intensive industry section 2 and based on the energy
storage section 4. The EII emissions and the ES emissions need to be then summed up
while removing double counting.
In case of activities overlapping between the EII and the ES parts, the revenue should be
the guiding principle to split production activities between the EII part and the ES part.
Example: a project produces steel through the electric-arc method, and has on-site
battery storage to take advantage of low electricity prices. During some periods of
high electricity price, the plant will release stored electricity to the grid instead of
using it for steel production. It is expected that 85% of the revenue comes from
steel production (EII part) and 15% from the energy stored (ES part). The applicant
should apply in the sector iron and steel and then follow section 2 for the EII part
(principal product steel) and section 4 for the ES part (principal product intra-day
or other electricity storage).
1.2.5.4 Renewable energy (RES) and energy storage (ES) projects
Projects that include production of renewable energy and storage of energy should be
presented as hybrid projects combining a RES component and an ES component. The
29EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
application should clarify the system boundaries for the two parts. The RES emissions and
the ES emissions need to be then summed up while removing double counting.
The correct emission factors shall be used for the RES and ES component of the project.
Refer to the provisions in this section and to section 1.4.3 for the relevant emission factors
for dispatchable and non-dispatchable electricity for the RES and ES components.
Example: Projects that generate renewable electricity and include a storage
component at times when there is an excess of electricity in the grid, e.g., smart
grid applications, are an example of hybrid projects. The application should clarify
the split for their feed-in of grid electricity into a storage component and the residual
uncontrolled feed-in. The emission avoidance of the storage component shall be
calculated as in section 4. The emission avoidance of the uncontrolled feed-in shall
follow the calculation of section 3.
For a hybrid RES+ES project, the applicant must demonstrate that the power from the
renewable energy facility will be supplied to the energy storage facility when the timing of
power generation is consistent with the needs of the storage facility. These projects can
claim credit under the RES methodology for any excess power exported. This also means
that the combined facility shall never be assumed to store power from the grid at the same
time as it is discharging power to the grid.
Example: Consider a hybrid project with a wind farm coupled with a battery storage
facility. If the wind farm is generating power during a period during which the
battery is being charged, the wind power should be used to charge the battery. Any
excess power not required for battery charging may then be exported to the grid.
To calculate the GHG emissions avoidance the equations described in sections 3 and
4 should be combined, and any double counted emissions removed.
1.2.5.5 Fuel production under energy intensive industries (EII) combined with fuel switch
under mobility (MOB)
Projects aiming exclusively at producing fuels for transport applications shall apply under
the EII category. However, projects that include both the production of the fuel and the
use of that fuel in a vessel, aircraft, or road vehiclefor may apply as hybrid projects
combining the EII category (for production of the fuel) with the MOB category.
In this way, MOB projects operating in the aviation and maritime sector may claim eventual
benefits from using the novel fuel in terms of reduced additional non-CO climate impacts
2
(e.g. black carbon in maritime or contrails in aviation). In such hybrid projects, CO , CH
2 4
and N O emissions from fossil fuel combustion that the project avoids by fossil fuel
2
substitution shall be included in the reference scenario for the EII part of the calculation,
by using the relevant fossil fuel comparator. Therefore, those terms shall be excluded from
the MOB part of the calculation to avoid double counting (i.e. from equation [5.1]).
1.3 Manufacturing of innovative technologies and their components
Some projects involve the manufacturing of components to be used in specific
renewable energy generation systems, energy storage systems, electrolysers, fuel cells,
or mobility systems, including the manufacturing of the entire systems (see Table 1.1,
section 1.2).
Such projects that submit an application for the call “Innovation Fund Call for proposals
2024 Net Zero Technologies” (INNOVFUND-2024-NZT) shall follow the rules in this section
and calculate emissions reductions based on the intended use of the manufactured
components rather than on the manufacturing process itself.
Instead, projects that submit an application under the call “Innovation Fund Call for
proposals 2024 Batteries” (INNOVFUND-2024-BATT) shall calculate their GHG emissions
30EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
following the provisions in Section 7, as the provisions in the rest of the methodology do
not apply to them.
When deciding under which call to submit an application, the applicant should carefully
review the eligibility conditions detailed in the call text of each call.
1.3.1 Choice of a sector for projects manufacturing innovative technologies and their
components
Projects covered under this section shall select the dedicated manufacturing sector under
the relevant category based on the type of component manufactured and its
intended use (see section 1.2):
• electrolysers and their components (EII/Manufacturing of components for energy
intensive industries);
• components for renewable energy generation, including heat pumps and fuel cells
for stationary applications (RES/Manufacturing of components for renewable
energy);
• components for energy storage systems, including batteries for stationary
applications (ES/Manufacturing of components for energy storage);
• components for maritime vessels, including batteries and fuel cells for application
in maritime vessels (MOB/Maritime).
• components for, aircrafts, including batteries and fuel cells for application in
aircrafts (MOB/Aviation).
• components for road vehicles, including batteries and fuel cells for road transport
applications (MOB/Road transport).
Eligible projects that manufacture components that are not listed above may not use the
rules in this section, may not apply in a “manufacturing of components” sector
under category EII, RES, and ES, and may not apply the manufacturing methodology under
category MOB, but may be permitted to apply in another sector following the relevant
provisions as applicable.
1.3.2 Definition of component
Projects covered under this section must produce specialised components, which includes
some specialised materials. Projects producing bulk materials shall not apply as
”manufacturing of components” projects under category EII, RES and ES, nor apply the
manufacturing methodology under category MOB, and they shall not use the provisions in
this section. However, they may be permitted to apply in another sector, for example a
relevant EII sector, following the relevant provisions as applicable.
For a manufactured product, including a recycled product, to be considered a component,
it shall have all the following characteristics distinguishing it from bulk materials:
• It shall be either a part of the energy or mobility system or a specialized material
used in the energy or mobility system and could be replaced with a spare part or
with replacement material;
• When leaving the manufacturing facility, it already has the intended specialized
function relevant to the final purpose of the energy or mobility system;
• It is innovative or produced/recycled in an innovative way;
31EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
• It is in a ready to use form, i.e., it can be directly assembled or integrated into the
energy or mobility system. Specialised materials must be in their final chemical
form for utilisation.
Example: bulk materials that can be used for manufacturing of batteries, but also
for other purposes, are not considered components. Instead, materials to be solely
used in batteries can be considered components, e.g., specific battery-grade anode
and cathode materials. Other examples of specialised materials are the cooling fluid
for a heat pump, and electrolytes.
The methodology for the manufacturing of a component may be applied to the
manufacturing of a whole consumer product, with the component being the whole
consumer product in this case (see section 1.3.3 and 1.3.5), and it may include the
assembling of sub-components procured from a supplier external to the project.
Example: the manufacturing of innovative electric vessels does not require the
manufacturing of the electric engines as part of the project but may be limited to the
assembly of the innovative vessels with the engines purchased from an external supplier.
1.3.3 Definition of facility and consumer product
Components manufactured by projects covered under this section may be used in facilities
which themselves produce product(s) within the scope of the Innovation Fund or may be
used in relevant consumer products:
• For projects manufacturing components for electrolysers (EII/manufacturing of
components for energy intensive industry), the component shall be considered to
be used in a fully functioning electrolyser, which can operate as a facility or can be
sold as a consumer product.
Example: components for electrolysers may be used in large-scale electrolysers for
the industrial production of hydrogen (facilities), or in small-scale electrolysers for
household or commercial use (consumer products).
• For projects manufacturing components for renewable energy generation, including
heat pumps (RES/manufacturing of components for renewable energy), the
component may be used in a facility or in a consumer product.
Example: components for solar panels may be used in solar farms (facilities) or in
solar panels for household use (consumer products).
• For projects manufacturing components for energy storage, including batteries for
stationary applications (ES/Manufacturing of components for energy storage), the
component may be used in a facility or in a consumer product.
Example: component for batteries may be used in large-scale installations for intra-
day electricity storage (facilities) or in batteries for household use (consumer
products).
• For projects manufacturing components for aircrafts, vessels, or road transport
vehicles, including batteries and fuel cells for transport applications (MOB/Aviation,
MOB/Maritime, MOB/Road Transport), the relevant consumer product is a
functioning aircraft, vessel or road vehicle.
1.3.4 Calculation of GHG emission avoidance for projects manufacturing innovative
technologies and their components
For the purpose of the GHG calculations, applicants shall bring within the system boundary
the operation of the facilities or consumer product that will be built using the components
manufactured by the project and supplied to the market (subject to the requirements in
32EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
section 1.3.5 regarding allocation of emissions savings proportionally to the cost share of
the component produced with respect to the total cost of the facility or consumer product).
The manufacturing plant producing the components shall be outside the system boundary
of the GHG calculation. Any additional GHG emission reduction compared to the traditional
processes of components manufacturing is outside of the scope of the GHG avoidance
calculations but may be claimed under “Other GHG savings” (see section 1.1.7).
For manufacturing of component projects, the emissions in the project and reference
scenarios are calculated considering that the components produced by the project (over
the first 10 year of operation of the manufacturing plant) will be installed in relevant
facilities and/or consumer products where they will be used for a use period (UP) of 5
years. Unless, the lifetime of the component is expected to be less than five years, in which
case the emissions shall be calculated based on the expected lifetime of the component
(i.e., the UP shall be set equal to the expected lifetime of the component).
Example: A manufacturing plant produces wind turbine blades. The manufacturer
expects the blades to remain in service for 20 years. The emission avoidance
calculations will consider that the blades produced each year will be used over a
period of 5 years, corresponding to the maximum allowed by the methodology.
Example: A manufacturing plant produces an innovative component for road
vehicles with an expected lifetime of 3 years. The emission avoidance calculations
will consider that the components produced each year will be used over a period of
3 years, corresponding to its lifetime.
1.3.5 Allocation of emissions avoidance based on the cost share of the component
Applicants can only claim a portion of the emission avoidance generated by the facility or
consumer product in which the manufactured component is used. This portion shall be
proportional to the cost of the single component as a share of the total capital cost of the
relevant facility or of the total retail price of the relevant consumer product (CS ).
component
For projects manufacturing a whole consumer product, as defined in section 1.3.3, the
CS shall be equal to 100%.
component
The relevant facility or consumer product to be used for this purpose is the one in which
the component is intended to be used. The same component use must be assumed when
calculating the cost share of the component as when determining the sector and when
calculating project and reference emissions.
If a manufacturing project will produce components with different possible uses, distinct
principal products may be defined for each of the intended use, which need to be well
justified.
Example: A project will manufacture fuel cells. The fuel cells are specifically
designed to be used in road transport vehicles (i.e., the consumer product). The
applicant must apply in the sector MOB/Road transport, and must calculate the cost
share of the component as the ratio between the cost of the fuel cell and the retail
price of a representative fuel cell vehicle. The applicant is not permitted to calculate
the cost share based on the use of the fuel cell for stationary applications. The
applicant should also justify the intended use of the fuel cells in road transport
applications by providing technical specifications, letters of intent and/or other
relevant supporting documents.
Example: A project will manufacture fuel cells. Some of the fuel cells are designed
to be used in road transport vehicles, while others are designed for use in stationary
applications. The applicant must make a hybrid application treating the different
33EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
types of fuel cells as two co-principal products, considering the stationary fuel cells
following the RES category rules in section 3 and the fuel cells for vehicles following
the mobility category rules in section 5. The sector for the application shall be
chosen considering the revenue share and level of innovation for each of the fuel
cell types, following the rules in section 1.2.2. A different cost share shall be
calculated for each part of the hybrid application, one based on the cost of a fuel
cell vehicle as consumer product, and the other based on the cost of a
representative stationary fuel cell facility. The applicant should justify the two
intended uses of the fuel cells, and the volume of products allocated to each use,
by providing technical specifications, letters of intent and/or other relevant
supporting documents.
The total capital cost of a facility is the sum of the cost of the manufactured component
plus the cost(s) of the remaining components constituting a typical operational facility. For
components used in consumer products, the retail price of the consumer product shall be
based on a typical use case for the component and shall exclude sales taxes. Applicants
must provide appropriate references to justify this cost assessment.
Example: A manufacturing plant produces wind turbine blades. The project shall
consider only a share of the reference and project emissions proportional to the
share of the capital cost of a wind farm facility spent on the blades. If the applicant
presents evidence that the rotor blades represent 25% of the total capital cost of a
wind turbine installation, then the project shall include only 25% of the associated
reference and project scenario emissions in its GHG calculations.
1.3.6 Assumptions for projects manufacturing innovative technologies and their
components
The operating conditions of the facility or consumer product in which the component will
be installed shall be estimated based on credible assumptions, and shall be well justified,
for example by providing technical specifications, letters of intent and/or other relevant
supporting documents. Applicants will have to justify the rationale for the projected
performance of the component produced, as well as of other components that will be
needed in the operational facility or consumer product, including performance degradation
where relevant.
The applicant may not assume that the facility or consumer product equipped with a
component manufactured by the project will have better performance or will be operated
in a way which increases the resulting emission avoidance with respect to standard
practice, unless these are a direct consequence of the installation of the innovative
component manufactured by the project.
The intended use of the facility or consumer product equipped with the manufactured
component may have an impact on the GHG emission avoidance calculations (see section
1.3.4). Therefore, the choice of the facility or consumer product in which the component
will be used must be well justified, for example by providing technical specifications, letters
of intent and/or other relevant supporting documents.
In case the actual user of the components produced during project implementation differs
from, or is not compatible with, the intended use specified in the application, the project
may not be able to reach the expected GHG emission avoidance, with potential implications
on grant disbursement.
Applicants shall estimate the number of components manufactured by the project and
supplied to the market based on the expected output of the manufacturing plant and the
market potential, and in line with the assumptions made in the rest of the proposal
concerning the operation of the plant, and including financial calculations. The actual
number of components manufactured and provided to the market must be monitored,
reported, and demonstrated with relevant supporting documents during project operation.
34EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
1.3.6.1 Default assumptions for projects manufacturing components for electrolysers and
hydrogen fuel cells for stationary applications
Applicants with projects manufacturing electrolyser components (EII/Manufacturing of
components for energy intensive industries) may assume that the electrolysers will operate
for 5,000 hours a year12 and may choose to use the following electrolyser capital cost
14F
assumptions13, or may provide their own project specific values:
15F
Electrolyser Alkaline PEM Solid oxide Anion exchange
technology
Capital cost 480 €/kW 700 €/kW 520 €/kW 550 €/kW
Applicants with projects to manufacture hydrogen fuel cell components for stationary
applications (RES/Manufacturing of components for renewable energy) may use the
following fuel cell capital cost assumptions, or may provide their own project specific
values:
Fuel cell technology < 5 kW 5-50 kW 51-500 kW
Stationary SOFC system 8,000 €/kW 7,500 €/kW 7,500 €/kW
(CHP)
Stationary PEMFC system 5,500 €/kW 2,150 €/kW 1,550 €/kW
(power generation)
1.4 Calculation of GHG emission avoidance
The calculations of GHG emission avoidance should comprehensively cover the emissions
in the reference scenario and in the project scenario. In the following, some general
guidance is provided. Detailed calculation guidance is provided by project category in
section 2 (EII), section 3 (RES), section 4 (ES), and section 5 (MOB), and in section 6
concerning the calculation of a carbon capture credit.
1.4.1 The reference scenario
The reference scenarios should reflect the production of a quantity of reference products,
produced in a way consistent with the current practice in the relevant sectors, that provides
an equivalent function to the principal products produced by the project.
Tables 1.2 and Table 1.3 provide examples or reference scenarios for a number of possible
principal products. The default values are also given in the spreadsheet-based GHG
calculators.

Example: A project converts biogenic residues into heat and sells the heat for
industrial and residential use. The reference scenario for renewable heating is pre-
set as the EU ETS benchmark for heat (see Table 1.2).
Example: A project produces hydrogen. The reference scenario is the EU ETS
benchmark for hydrogen.
1.4.2 Relationship to the calculation of relevant costs
The GHG emission avoidance calculations and the relevant cost calculations should
generally be aligned and based on coherent assumptions, where relevant. For example, in
terms of yearly production volumes, plant operation, and quantity of components yearly
supplied to the market. However, applicants should be aware that the scope of the relevant
costs methodology and the scope of the Methodology for GHG Emission Avoidance
Calculation may differ in some cases.
36EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Example: In a CCS project, in the GHG methodology, applicants must consider
downstream emissions along the entire CCS chain, including emissions which may
fall outside the scope of the project in terms of capital investment.
Example: In a manufacturing facility, the GHG methodology focuses on the
emissions during the use of the components, while the relevant cost methodology
considers the construction and operation of the manufacturing plant.
1.4.3 GHG emission factors for electricity, hydrogen, and heat
The calculation methodology requires the use of different emission factors for electricity,
hydrogen and heat depending on whether they are inputs to, or outputs from a project,
and on other contextual factors such as the project category. This section details which
emission factors to use in each case.
1.4.3.1 Electricity
The EU is expected to achieve full decarbonisation of grid electricity by 2050. In order to
assess Innovation Fund applications based on their long-term potential in a decarbonised
economy, the GHG emissions for Innovation Fund projects shall be calculated treating the
grid electricity consumed by a project as having zero associated GHG emissions,
which corresponds to the projected average emissions of the 2050 grid electricity
mix14. Applicants must still report expected electricity consumption by their projects for
16F
knowledge-sharing purposes.
The Innovation Fund also seeks to support projects that will make a contribution to
delivering a fully decarbonised grid. The GHG emissions for projects that will supply
non-dispatchable renewable energy shall be calculated treating the electricity replaced by
the project as having the expected average emissions of the 2030 grid electricity mix (with
an emission factor of 48.8 gCO e/MJ [0.176 tCO e/MWh]15), while the GHG emissions for
2 2

projects that provide dispatchable renewable electricity or energy storage shall be assessed
treating electricity replaced as having the GHG emissions of dispatchable single cycle
natural gas power generation (with an emission factor of 140 gCO e/MJ [0.505
2
tCO e/MWh]16).
2
18F
Example 1: A project produces renewable electricity from an intermittent source,
such as wind or solar power. The electricity replaced by the project shall be
considered to be non-dispatchable, and the corresponding emission factor is the
expected average emission factor of the 2030 grid electricity mix (0.176
tCO e/MWh).
2
Example 2: A project produces renewable electricity from a source that can make
the energy output available on demand, such as geothermal or biomass power. The
electricity replaced by the project shall be considered to be dispatchable, and the
corresponding emission factor is the one corresponding to single cycle natural gas
power generation (0.505 tCO e/MWh).

Example 3: A project produces renewable electricity from an intermittent source,
such as wind or solar power, and is coupled with a battery storage system. The
project can apply as a hybrid RES + ES project following the provisions in section
1.2.5.4. The amount of renewable electricity that is fed directly to the grid shall be
considered non-dispatchable. In turn, the amount of renewable electricity that is

from the emission-saving methodology the Commission proposes for renewable fuels of non-biological origin
and recycled carbon fuels under REDII.

used to charge the battery during periods of low demand from the grid, and that is
then discharged to the grid during period of high demand, may be considered
dispatchable.
The project cannot consider “dispatchable” any amount of electricity that is
discharged by the energy storage system while it is simultaneously charging. This
means that, for the purposes of GHG calculations, the energy storage system cannot
discharge electricity while it is charging at the same time. Also, the project cannot
consider “dispatchable” any amount of electricity that is discharged by the energy
storage system, while the renewable energy system could have provided the same
amount at the same time. This means that the project cannot artificially lower the
output of the renewable energy system during period of high demand, to prioritise
energy discharge from the battery storage system.
In the energy intensive industries category (EII, section 2), emission avoidance associated
with electricity use or generation can be claimed by projects in one of the following three
cases:
• EII projects generating electricity for export to the grid can claim related emission
avoidance by treating the produced electricity as a co-principal product and
including the net amount of electricity exported to the grid as a term in the
reference scenario, with an emission factor equal to the expected average emissions
of the 2030 grid electricity mix (48.8 gCO e/MJ [0.176 tCO e/MWh]). Note that in
2 2
the case that a project both consumes electricity from an external source (such as
the grid) and exports electricity, only the net amount of electricity exported can be
considered as a product when assessing reference emissions.
Note that projects that combine an EII component with a component of renewable
energy generation for net export to the grid should instead apply as hybrid projects
following the provisions in section 1.2.5.2.
• EII projects that reduce their electricity consumption with respect to the reference
scenario can claim related emission avoidance by identifying the net amount of
electricity saved as a term in the reference scenario, with an emission factor equal
to the expected average emissions of the 2030 grid electricity mix (48.8 gCO e/MJ
2
[0.176 tCO e/MWh]).
2
This type of project cannot be combined with other emission avoidance measures
and shall follow the provisions detailed in section 2.2.6.
• EII projects that use predominantly electricity with low emission factor by timing
their electricity demand, thereby increasing absorption of variable renewable
electricity and reducing the need for dispatchable fossil power, can claim a credit
related to the ‘virtual’ energy storage service provided by applying the provisions
in section 2.2.6.6).
Table 1.3 summarises which emission factors for electricity shall be used in the calculations
depending on the type of project and whether the electricity is consumed by or exported
from it. These emissions factors apply to both the project and reference scenarios as
specified in the table. The treatment of electricity under each project category is detailed
in the respective section of this methodology.

1.4.3.2 Hydrogen
Table 1.4 summarises which emission factors for hydrogen shall be used in the calculations
depending on the type of project and whether the hydrogen is consumed by or exported
from it. These emissions factors apply to both the project and reference scenarios as
specified in the table. The treatment of hydrogen under each project category is detailed
in the respective section of this methodology.
For EII projects (section 2), the emission factor to be used for the hydrogen that is fed to
the project as an input (i.e. sourced from outside the project boundary) is determined by
the origin of the hydrogen. If hydrogen is used as an input in both the project and reference
scenarios, the applicant must assume the same origin for the hydrogen in both
scenarios, in line with the provisions in section 2.2.6.1. This includes the case in which
the reference scenario is based on an EU ETS benchmark that includes the consumption of
generic hydrogen (see example 2 below).
The origin of hydrogen can be classified as:
• Generic hydrogen, for which an emission factor of 6.84 tCO e/tH shall be used.
2 2
• Renewable hydrogen (i.e. hydrogen as a renewable fuel, RFNBO or of biological
origin) as defined in the Renewable Energy Directive 2018/2001 (RED) and its
Delegated Regulations, and meeting the greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria
set in Article 29 or Article 29a. An emission factor of 0.00 tCO e/tH may be used
2 2
for renewable hydrogen.
• Low-carbon hydrogen as defined in Directive 2024/1788 on common rules for the
internal markets for renewable gas, natural gas and hydrogen, for which an
emission factor of 0.00 tCO e/tH may be used.
2 2
The applicant must credibly justify the assumptions made with respect to the origin of the
hydrogen, for example by providing letter of supports from potential suppliers or other
supporting documents. If the origin of the hydrogen is not known yet at the time of the
application, and/or if its renewable or low-carbon origin cannot be credibly justified, then
the hydrogen should be considered of “generic” origin.
In addition, the applicant must propose adequate monitoring measures in its monitoring
plan (see section 1.5 and Appendix 4) to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting of the
assumptions made at the application stage with respect to the origin of the hydrogen.
Failure to provide adequate justification and an an adequate monitoring and reporting plan
may affect the quality of the GHG calculations and the resulting evaluation. In addition,
failure to demonstrate the actual origin of the hydrogen during project implementation
may affect the overall GHG emission avoidance that can be achieved by the project, which
may have consequence in terms of grant disbursement as specified in the Call Text.
Example 1: A project intends to use direct hydrogen reduction to produce sponge
iron instead of a traditional coal-based steel making process. Hydrogen is only used
as an input in the project scenario; therefore, the applicant shall choose the relevant
emission factor based on the origin of the hydrogen. An emission factor of zero can
only be assumed if the applicant is able to credibly justify, and demonstrate during
project implementation, the renewable or low-carbon origin of the hydrogen.
Otherwise, the hydrogen shall be assumed to be of generic origin.
Example 2: An ammonia production project will use hydrogen as an input, and the
applicant intends to source RFNBO hydrogen from outside the project boundaries.
The ammonia production process is similar to a conventional hydrogen to ammonia
process, and the reference scenario is based on the EU ETS benchmark for ammonia
production. Since the reference scenario is based on an EU ETS benchmark that
includes the consumption of generic hydrogen, then the emissions associated to the
40EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
hydrogen input in the project scenario must be based on the emissions factor for
generic hydrogen, irrespective of the actual origin of the hydrogen.
Example 3: An ammonia production project includes within its scope (i.e. includes
specific actions, tasks, and investments into) an electrolysis unit to produce
electrolytic hydrogen on-site to be fed into the Haber-Bosch process. The hydrogen
production process is within the project boundaries. Therefore, hydrogen is not an
input to the project, and the rules concerning hydrogen used as an input do not
apply. The project can consider an emission factor of zero for the electricity
consumed by the electrolyser, and the reference scenario shall be based on the EU
ETS benchmark for ammonia.

1.4.4 Biomass-derived fuels and materials
For the purposes of this methodology, ‘biomass-derived fuels’ include biomass, biomass
fuels, biogas and biomethane, bioliquids, and biofuels, used for energy generation (see
Appendix 5). CCU fuels produced using CO of biogenic origin are not considered to be
2
biomass-derived fuels.
For the purposes of this methodology, ‘biomass-derived fuels and materials’ include
biomass-derived fuels and biomassderived materials (i.e. materials of biogenic origin used
-
for purposes other than energy generation, see Appendix 5). CCU products produced using
CO of biogenic origin are not considered to be biomass-derived fuels and materials.
2
This methodology requires applicants to use an emission factor of zero for biogenic CO
2
emissions from: the combustion of biomass-derived fuels and materials; their
decomposition or degradation; and other chemical or biological processes (e.g.
43EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
fermentation). This methodology also excludes the avoidance of methane emissions from
alternative disposal of biomass-derived fuels and materials entering the project as inputs
(e.g. their diversion from landfill).
CO and non-CO emissions associated with the supply of biomass-derived fuels and
2 2
materials used as an elastic input by an EII project, or used for energy generation by a
RES project, are in scope and must be considered in line with section 1.4.4.2.
If biomass-derived fuels and materials are used as rigid inputs by an EII project, for
example residual and waste biomass resources, the provisions of section 2.2.6.4 and the
other relevant provisions in the EII section of the methodology apply.
Emissions of non-CO greenhouse gases (e.g. CH and N O) associated with the combustion
2 4 2
or use of biomass-derived fuels and materials, the leakage or venting of biogas and
biomethane, decomposition and degradation, and any other chemical or biological process
within the system boundary (e.g. fermentation) are in scope, and must be included unless
an exception is stated in the methodology sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 as relevant to the type of
project (e.g. EII, RES, ES, MOB).
For EII projects, combustion and end-of-life emissions of biomass-derived fuels and
materials produced as principal products are covered by the provisions of section 2.2.7 and
2.2.9. For non-principal products, refer to the provisions in section 2.2.10.
1.4.4.1 Sustainability requirements for biomass-derived fuels and materials
Any biomass used in Innovation Fund projects, including residual and waste biomass
resources, must conform to the relevant minimum requirement specified in the Call Text.
Any biofuel, bioliquid, and biomass fuel (including biogas and biomethane) used in an
Innovation Fund project must comply with the Renewable Energy Directive 2018/2001
(RED) and its Delegated Regulations, and meet the sustainability and greenhouse gas
emissions saving criteria set in Article 29 of RED.
The applicant must credibly justify the assumptions made with respect to the classification
and origin of a biomass-derived fuel or materials, for example by providing letter of
supports from potential suppliers or other supporting documents. In addition, the applicant
must propose adequate measures in the monitoring plan (see section 1.5 and Appendix 4)
to ensure that the nature and origin of biomass-derived fuels and materials can be
adequately reported and monitored.
Failure to provide adequate justification and to propose adequate monitoring measures
may affect the quality of the GHG calculations and the resulting evaluation. In addition,
failure to demonstrate the actual nature and origin of the biomass-derived fuel or material
during project implementation may affect the overall GHG emission avoidance that can be
achieved by the project, which may have consequence in terms of grant disbursement as
specified in the Call Text.
1.4.4.2 Production and supply of biomass-derived fuels and materials
Where biomass-derived fuels and materials are consumed by a project as an elastic input
under the EII category or as fuels for the production of energy under the RES category (in
the term Proj in equation 3.8), the GHG emission factor for the production and
bio supply
supply of those biomass-derived fuels and materials, including both CO and non-CO
2 2
emissions, shall be calculated, in tCO e/TJ, following the provisons in this sub-section.
2
When the biomass-derived fuels and materials utilised are listed in Annex V or VI of the
Renewable Energy Directive 2018/2001 (RED), the applicant shall calculate the relevant
emission factor by summing together the following terms, as provided in the directive:
19F
44EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
• e emissions from the extraction or cultivation of raw materials;
ec
• e annualised emissions from carbon stock changes caused by land-use change;
l
• e emissions from processing;
p
• e emission savings from soil carbon accumulation via improved agricultural
sca
management.
If the biomass-derived fuels and materials used are not listed in Annex V or VI of the RED,
then the applicant shall define an appropriate emission factor following the RED calculation
principles and the hierarchy of data sources (Appendix 1).
Emissions associated to the transport of biomass feedstocks are covered by the provisions
in section 1.4.5, and should be considered only if the biomass feedstocks are transported
for more than 500 km to reach the first point of processing/treatment. When transport
emissions must be considered, then they shall be calculated, in tCO e/TJ, and added to the
2
emission factor for production and supply of biomass-derived fuels and materials as defined
above. Otherwise, transport and distribution emissions may be treated as zero.
Credit for carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use may only be given to a
project by including a carbon capture credit following the rules in section 6. Therefore, a
carbon capture term cannot be included in the emission factor for biomass-derived fuels
and materials.
1.4.5 Transport emissions
Emissions associated with transport are to be considered in the following cases:
Where a project includes an element of carbon capture and utilisation or carbon capture
and storage (CCU/S) the project emissions must include any emissions associated with
CO transport. This is to ensure that the net GHG benefits from carbon capture are not
2
unduly undermined by any energy intensive CO handling. Refer to section 6 for dedicated
2
guidance.
Where a project is basing the reference scenario for one or more of its principal products
on a physically different product that is used for a comparable function, then the project
emissions must include any emissions associated with distributing that principal product to
the point of use. This is to ensure that the net GHG benefits from a shift to the use of novel
products are not unduly undermined by energy intensive distribution practices.
Example: Project scenario: hydrogen supplied for transportation.
The project scenario must include in the processes box the emissions associated
with distributing the principal product (hydrogen) to the vehicle tank, including any
emissions from the transfer of hydrogen by truck, pipeline or other means to a
hydrogen refuelling station.
Hydrogen refuelling stations may lose hydrogen by boil-off from the liquid hydrogen
storage tank, or use energy to re-liquefy the boiled-off hydrogen. Any emissions
from re-liquefaction must be included in the processes box, and the amount of
energy supplied in the reference scenario should reflect the amount of hydrogen
that is finally supplied to vehicles if this is less than the amount of hydrogen leaving
the hydrogen production facility.
The reference scenario emissions shall be calculated based on the relevant fossil
fuel comparator.
Where a project uses biomass or waste materials as feedstock/inputs, the project
emissions must include any additional emissions associated with gathering those materials
45EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
and transporting them to the first point of processing/treatment when the transport range
exceeds 500 km. This is to ensure that the net GHG benefits associated with utilising
biomass or resources that would otherwise be wasted are not unduly undermined by the
emissions associated with their transport, given that they may be transported over
potentially long distances.
To calculate GHG emissions from the transportation of biomass or waste feedstock which
are input to or are used as fuels in the system, applicants shall either use:
• Primary data: actual fuel consumption figures in the calculation submitted when
data can be tracked from the distribution/logistics companies, or;
• Secondary data: estimated fuel consumption, based on distance between sites, and
volume transported multiplied by the emission factors presented in Table 1.6 or other
similar values that the applicant could duly justify.
If applicants’ data is available per trip, applicants should calculate the emissions for each
trip, using the average distance in each leg, and the amount of material transported in that
exact leg, which can be derived from the estimate capacity of the truck. Otherwise, an
approximated estimate of the total distance travelled in the year and the total emissions
transported in the year is allowed as a proxy.

1.4.6 Combustion emissions
Emissions from combustion of fuels or other materials within the system boundary must
be included in the emissions avoidance calculation. This must include the amount of non-
CO greenhouse gases (in particular CH and N O) produced under the expected
2 4 2
combustion conditions, on a CO equivalent basis.
2
CO emitted from the combustion of biomass-derived fuels and materials may be treated
2
as having an emission factor of zero, but other greenhouse gases emitted in the
combustion of biomass-derived fuels and materials shall be considered.
Where materials containing carbon atoms are used or produced by a project, the
methodology requires in some specific cases that the applicant must consider the
‘stoichiometric combustion emissions’ of CO for that material. The stoichiometric
2
emissions shall be calculated as the amount of CO that would be produced if all of the
2
46EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
carbon in the material were to be oxidised to CO . Where the guidance asks for
2
stoichiometric combustion emissions to be included, it is not necessary to consider the
potential generation of other greenhouse gases under real-world combustion conditions.
1.4.7 Changes in performance over the period of a project
Some projects will be subject to predictable changes in production over the course of the
first ten years of operation. For example, solar panels are subject to a degree of
degradation that can be expected to reduce electricity output per installed solar cell over
the time. The effects of such degradation or other changes should be reflected in the
calculation of the reference scenario emissions or project scenario emissions as relevant.
If likely changes in performance have not been properly considered in the GHG calculation,
this may affect the assessment of the quality of the GHG calculation.
1.5 Monitoring, reporting and verification of performance for disbursement and
knowledge-sharing
During operation, beneficiaries will have to demonstrate the GHG emission avoidance
achieved by the project, and demonstrate that the assumptions made at the application
stage are representative of the actual operation of the project. Additional requirements are
introduced for the purpose of knowledge-sharing (KS).
In general, beneficiaries shall obtain, record, compile, analyse and document monitoring
data, including assumptions, references, activity data and calculation factors in a
transparent manner that enables the checking of performance achieved during the
operation of the project. Beneficiaries shall ensure that the operational data determination
is neither systematically nor knowingly inaccurate17 and avoid bias in the selection of
20F
assumptions. In selecting a monitoring methodology, the improvements from greater
accuracy shall be balanced against additional costs.
At the application stage, failure to provide an adequate monitoring plan may negatively
affect the quality of the GHG calculations, and the resulting evaluation.
During project implementation, failure to demonstrate that the assumptions made at the
application stage are representative of the actual operation of the project, may affect the
overall GHG emission avoidance that can be achieved, which may have consequences in
terms of grant disbursement as specified in the Call Text.
The GHG emission avoidance achieved by a project over the entire monitoring period will
need to be verified by an independent GHG verifier. This includes a verification that the
assumptions made at the application stage are representative of the actual operation of
the project. A verified GHG emission avoidance report over the entire monitoring period
must be provided at the end of the last year of operation, as specified in the Call Text. The
general conditions on monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of performance,
disbursement of the grant, and knowledge-sharing are described in the Call Text. The
duration of the monitoring and reporting period is also specified in the Call Text.
Appendix 4 provides details on the specific requirements for reporting for the purposes of
grant disbursement and for knowledge-sharing purposes for the different project
categories and sectors.

2 Energy intensive industry (EII), including substitute products, and carbon
capture and utilisation (CCU)
2.1 Scope
This section deals with the methodology to estimate GHG emission avoidance in the
proposed projects concerning activities falling in the energy intensive industry category
and sectors (see section 1.2).
Projects that produce a CCU product as one of their principal products must follow
the rules in this section. Projects concerned with innovative processing of biomass
feedstock to produce biomass-derived fuels and/or materials in bio-refineries also must
follow the provisions in this section.
Some guidance on cases where a sector choice might be less obvious is given in Table 2.1.
Table 2.1. Examples of sector choices
Projects Choice of sector
Bio-refineries Depending on the final products, bio-refinery projects need to choose either: refineries if
predominantly producing fuels; or chemicals if predominantly producing chemicals; or pulp
and paper if predominantly producing pulp and paper products. In some cases (such as a bio-
based substance with both fuel and chemical applications) applicants will have to choose
between refineries and chemicals referring to the guidance in section 1.2.
Direct air capture with CCS EII / Other
(DACCS)
Waste-to-energy with CCS
DAC with CCU Such projects must produce in substitute products for the products listed in Annex I of the
CCU ETS Directive. The sector to choose is the sector of the substitute product.
Wastewater treatment If biofuels are produced, then refineries can be chosen.
If there is no EII relevant product produced but the treatment of wastewater uses renewable
energy, then the sector is “Use of renewable energy outside Annex I” under the RES category
(section 3).
Water desalination If using renewable energy, then the sector is “Use of renewable energy outside Annex I” in
the RES category.
Otherwise, the sector can be EII / Other.
Production of hydrogen Such projects generally fall under the sector EII/hydrogen.
from electricity If the project includes specific actions and tasks related to ensure the use of the hydrogen in
a specific application, then the sector may be determined by that application in which
hydrogen will be used. For example, a project including actions and tasks related to setting
up and operating hydrogen refuelling stations could apply in the sector EII/refineries.
If the main aim of the project is the production of hydrogen as a mean of storage of excess
renewable electricity (e.g. the electricity consumed is limited to periods of high renewable
energy production, which result in a particularly low load factor) the project could apply in
the sector Energy Storage/Other energy storage Following the provisions in section 4.

2.2 GHG emissions avoidance
2.2.1 Absolute and relative GHG emissions avoidance
Applicants have to calculate both the absolute and relative emissions avoidance expected
from the project. For the general formulas, refer to sections 1.1.3 and 1.1.4. The absolute
emissions avoided by the project are the emissions of the reference scenario minus the
emissions of the project scenario. The relative emissions avoidance is then calculated
by dividing the absolute emissions avoided by the emissions of the reference scenario.
2.2.2 Life-cycle stages
The GHG emissions for each life-cycle stage shall be included in the calculations for the
reference scenario and the project scenario, as illustrated in Figure 2.1.
The reference scenario provides the same functions as principal product(s) provide(s) in
the project scenario. As explained in the section 1.2: the principal product(s) should reflect
the main aim and innovation of the project; the reference scenario should reflect the
current state-of-the-art in the given sector.
The applicants shall provide a detailed process diagram for the project and reference
scenarios, indicating all the sub-processes, inputs, and products for both scenarios. The
diagram should include quantities of the material and energy flows, when relevant. The
applicants may use Figure 2.1 for guidance.
Figure 2.1. Diagram of GHG emission avoidance related to InnovFund EII projects
Source: European Commission internal elaboration.
Both scenarios shall include any relevant emissions in the boxes corresponding to “inputs”,
“processes”, “combustion (principal products)”, “end of life (principal products)”, and “non-
principal products”. The emission sources (positive emission terms) and credits (negative
emission terms) to be considered in each life-cycle stage (“box”) are explained in further
detail in this section.
The “change to in-use (principal products)” emissions box appears only in the project
scenario. If an innovative product reduces GHG in-use emissions compared to the reference
49EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
scenario, then this change should be recorded only in the box for the project scenario with
a negative term. The in-use emissions shall not be reported in the reference scenario.
Applicants shall differentiate “change to in-use (principal products)” box from the case of
fuels or other combusted products, where combustion emissions are included in the
“combustion (principal products)” box.
2.2.3 System boundary
In the context of the GHG emission calculations for an Innovation Fund project, the system
boundary defines the set of processes to be assessed.
At the minimum the system boundary for the project scenario must include the parts of an
installation at which innovative practices are being introduced by the project and any
processes downstream of those innovative practices that are required to produce the
principal products from the project. These processes must be included in the “processes”
box of the project scenario (see section 2.2.5).
Processes upstream of the innovative processes may also be brought within the
system boundary if they are under the control of the applicants and within the scope of the
project. Otherwise, the outputs of those upstream processes shall be treated as inputs to
the project and included in the “inputs” box (see section 2.2.6).
Note for applicants familiar with earlier versions of the methodology: This
provision has changed with respect to previous versions of the methodology, in which
applicants were allowed to expand the system boundary to include any number of upstream
processes, even when they were not under their control and outside the scope of the
project – this is no longer permitted.
The reference scenario is defined by the principal product(s) being produced by the project.
The system boundary for the reference scenario will depend on the type of reference
scenario that is appropriate to the project in question. The different cases for construction
of a reference scenario are detailed in section 2.2.4.
Proposals may be submitted jointly by more than one entity that have formed a
consortium. The methodology calculates the emissions savings for the whole project, not
for each individual entity within the consortium. Therefore, there is no need to split the
emission reduction between members of a consortium.
2.2.3.1 System boundary in the case of an innovation applied to only part of a plant’s
throughput
In some cases, an innovative element of a process may be introduced that reduces the
emissions of only a fraction of the overall throughput of an existing industrial plant. In such
cases, the GHG calculations shall be undertaken as follows:
• If the innovation could, in principle, be extended (i.e. scaled up) to cover the entire
throughput of the plant then the system boundary must be drawn around a part of
the plant proportional to the amount of throughput to which the innovation is
applied. If, for example, the innovation applies to 30% of the throughput, then the
GHG calculations may include that 30% of the throughput only. The project scenario
shall include only the portion of the throughput to which the innovation is applied,
and the reference scenario shall include the conventional production of an
equivalent amount of reference product.
Example: an ammonia production plant that currently consumes 100 thousand
tonnes of hydrogen and produces 550 thousand tonnes of ammonia per year applies
to the Innovation Fund for support to add an electrolysis unit (powered by electricity
from RES) capable of producing 10 thousand tonnes of green hydrogen per year
(one tenth of the input hydrogen). In principle it would be possible to add additional
50EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
electrolysis units to produce enough green hydrogen to supply the entire facility.
The applicant may set the system boundary to include only a tenth of the whole
facility, so that the project scenario would be based on 100% green hydrogen use
and 55 thousand tonnes of ammonia output. The reference scenario would be based
on the EU ETS ammonia benchmark for 55 thousand tonnes of production.
• If there are technical reasons that prevent the innovation from being scaled up to
cover the entire throughput of the plant, then the project scenario must include the
whole throughput of the plant, including the portion to which the innovation is
applied and the portion to which the innovation is not applied. The reference
scenario should include the conventional production of an amount of reference
product equivalent to the total throughput of the plant.
Example: a glass production project will produce new glass by a combination of
waste glass recycling and additional raw materials, recycling 20 thousand tonnes of
waste glass a year and producing 40 thosuand tonnes of new glass. For technical
reasons, the project limits the use of waste glass to 50% of the input stream. The
whole facility must be placed within the system boundary, and the project must
include the emissions associated with sourcing and processing the non-waste raw
materials. The reference scenario would be based on the EU ETS benchmark for
glass making for 40 thousand tonnes of output.
If the system boundary is set to anything other than the size of the full facility, and the
GHG calculations consider anything than the entire throughput of the plant, applicants
must justify this decision. Failure to do so may negatively impact the credibility of the GHG
emission avoidance calculations, and the resulting evalution.
2.2.4 Choice and construction of a reference scenario
The reference scenario includes emissions of conventional “processes” that would produce
products that provide equivalent function(s) to the project’s principal product(s). An
“equivalent function” is usually the same quantity of a physically similar conventional
product(s). If the principal product does not have a physically similar conventional
alternative, then the reference scenario would be based on the production of the
conventional product, or combination of conventional products, that would fulfil an
equivalent function as the produced product.
In any cases where there is more than one possible reference scenario, the reference
scenario must be based on the conventional products most likely to fulfil the function in
the absence of the project, unless the project includes specific actions and tasks to use the
product to substitute a physically different product (refer to section 1.2.1).
If the application is based on an inappropriate reference scenario (e.g., by choosing a
reference scenario with higher emissions in preference to a reference scenario that would
be more likely in the absence of the project) then this may affect the quality of the GHG
emission avoidance calculations and the resulting evaluation.
Sum of individual reference scenarios: the full reference scenario of the project will
consist of the sum of the individual reference scenarios for each of the principal products
identified for the project. This may involve summing reference scenario emissions
calculated following more than one of the nine cases detailed below.
Example: A project with two principal products: hydrogen and synthetic diesel fuel.
A reference scenario consists of the sum of a reference scenario based on the EU
ETS product benchmark for hydrogen production, and a reference scenario based
on the InnovFund fossil fuel comparator for diesel.
One ‘combined’ reference scenario: in some cases, it may be possible to identify for
two or more principal products in the project scenario just one ‘combined’ production
51EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
process in the reference scenario, provided that it is possible to match the quantity of each
principal product in the project scenario to the quantity of each product from the reference
scenario.
Example: An innovative process produces ethylene and propylene as principal
products. Ethylene and propylene are co-products of the conventional steam
cracking process, for which there is an EU ETS benchmark. The EU ETS benchmark
for steam cracking may be used as a combined reference provided that the outputs
of ethylene and propylene from the project are consistent with the benchmark
specifications. The description of the benchmark (definition of products covered)
reads: “Mix of high value chemicals (HVC) [...] with an ethylene content in the total
product mix of at least 30 mass-percent and a content of HVC, fuel gas, butenes
and liquid hydrocarbons of together at least 50 mass-percent of the total product
mix”.
Nine cases for setting the reference scenario for a principal product:
The following nine cases (discussed in detail in sub-section 2.2.4.1 through 2.2.4.9) shall
be used to define a reference scenario for each of the principal products of the project.
1. If there is an EU ETS product benchmark corresponding to production of the
principal product, that benchmark shall be the basis for the reference scenario.
2. If there is no EU ETS product benchmark available that directly corresponds to
production of a principal product, it may be possible to construct an appropriate
reference scenario by combining EU ETS heat, fuel and/or process sub-installations
with an existing EU ETS product benchmark.
3. If the project is a modification of an existing production system, the applicant may
choose to use the existing production system as the reference scenario, subject to
conditions detailed in sub-section 2.2.4.3.
4. If the principal product is a transport fuel substitute, then the reference scenario
for that product shall be based on the InnovFund fossil fuel comparator values.
5. If the principal product is a natural gas substitute, then the reference scenario shall
be based on the combustion emissions intensity of natural gas.
6. If the principal product can be synthesised from natural gas (e.g., methanol) and
an emission value is available in the inputs data hierarchy (Appendix 1) for
production of that principal product with natural gas as the primary feedstock18,
21F
then the applicant shall base the reference scenario on that emission value.
7. If the project is for CCS from direct air capture, the reference scenario is zero
emissions.
8. If the project is to transport and/or store CO captured outside the system
2
boundary, the reference emission is the quantity of CO entering the system
2
boundary.
9. Where it is not possible to construct a reference scenario for the production of one
or more of the principal products from a project in the ways identified above, then
the applicant may propose an appropriate reference scenario, subject to the
conditions detailed in sub-section 2.2.4.9 This option can only be used for situation
that are not covered by any of the previous cases, and the choice to use this option
must be credibly justified by the applicant. In addition, the applicant must provide
18 If it is not clear whether a pathway value contained in the data hierarchy assumes a natural gas feedstock,
then the applicant should instead propose a reference scenario following the requirements of case 9.
52EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
clear justifications of the proposed approach and a robust characterisation of the
emissions associated with the reference system proposed.
2.2.4.1 Case 1: A relevant EU ETS product benchmark (or benchmarks) exists
For projects producing principal products for which an EU ETS product benchmark is defined
in Annex I of the applicable Benchmarking Decision19 at the time of the submission of the
22F
application, the reference scenario shall be based on that EU ETS product benchmark. The
EU ETS benchmark emissions for the production of the relevant amount of the
principal product shall be included in the “processes” box of the reference scenario.
For projects producing heat as a principal product, the EU ETS heat benchmark shall
be used to calculate the emissions in the ”processes” box of the reference scenario.
For projects producing hydrogen as a principal product, the EU ETS hydrogen
benchmark shall be used to calculate the emissions in the ”processes” box of the reference
scenario unless the project includes specific actions and tasks related to the use of the
hydrogen produced in a specified application (section 1.2.1).
Example: A project produces hydrogen at a new facility to be used in an industrial
application. The EU ETS benchmark value for hydrogen (2021 Benchmarking
Decision: 6.84 tCO e/tH ) shall be applied to all the hydrogen production as the
2 2
reference.
Example: A project produces hydrogen at a new facility to be supplied to hydrogen
refuelling stations for use in fuel cell vehicles, but the project does not include
any action or task related to the construction and operation of the
hydrogen refuelling stations, nor associated investments. The EU ETS
benchmark value for hydrogen (2021 Benchmarking Decision: 6.84 tCO e/tH ) shall
2 2
be applied to all the hydrogen production as the reference.
Example: A project produces hydrogen at a new facility to be supplied to hydrogen
refuelling stations for use in fuel cell vehicles, and the project includes relevant
actions and tasks related to the construction and operation of a sufficient number
of refuelling stations to supply the entire volume of hydrogen produced for the
intended application. The applicant may choose to set the reference scenario
emissions based on Case 4: Transport Fuel Substitutes instead of using Case 1
based on the EU ETS benchmark value for hydrogen, provided that this choice is
credibly justified.
Benchmark values for refinery units and processes included in Annex II of Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 shall not be used to set reference scenario
emissions. If no relevant benchmark value is available in Annex I of the applicable
Benchmarking Decision20, then the reference scenario shall be determined following one of
23F
the other cases below.
In some cases, the processes producing a principal product in the reference scenario may
correspond to a combination of multiple EU ETS product benchmarks.

53EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Example: A project producing hot metal.
Constructing the appropriate reference scenario may require the applicant to
combine the benchmarks for coke, sintered ore, and hot metal as all are part of the
conventional hot metal production process. It will be necessary to provide in the
calculation the expected consumption per unit of output of the intermediate
products (in this case coke and sintered ore) that are used in the production of the
final product (hot metal).
The reference scenario shall include emissions in additional boxes that the EU ETS
product benchmark(s) do(es) not cover21:
24F
“Inputs”. The EU ETS benchmarks do not include emissions associated with the production
and supply of inputs used by the process. The applicant shall identify the quantities of
inputs to be used in the conventional production process associated with the ETS
benchmark in the reference scenario.
Example: the EU ETS benchmark for ‘bottles and jars of colourless glass’ does not
include upstream emissions associated to the production of the material inputs to
the conventional glass making process, such as sand, soda ash, and limestone.
Therefore, the applicant shall identify appropriate emission factors for sand, soda
ash, and limestone in the input data hierarchy (Appendix 1) and include the relevant
input emissions in the “inputs” box or the reference scenario.
Note that, in the definition of the reference and project scenario, and the
calculation of reference and project emissions, it is necessary to include also
emissions that are the same in both scenarios as their exclusion would alter the
relative emissions savings result. This is applicable to the case that some of the
inputs are the same in the reference and project scenarios in terms of volumes
and associated emissions.
“Non-principal products” associated with the reference scenario. In some cases, non-
principal products must be included in the “non-principal products” box of the reference
scenario.
Example: The EU ETS benchmark for short fibre kraft pulp reflects a process that
generates tall oil as a non-principal product. An emission credit associated with the
production of the associated quantity of tall oil must be included in the “non-
principal products” box of the reference scenario.
If the same non-principal product is produced in both the reference and project scenarios,
then the credit should be included in both scenarios.
“Combustion (principal products)” where combustion of principal products occurs in
the reference scenario, related emissions must be included in the “Combustion (principal
products)” box of the reference scenario.
Example: A project will produce a coke substitute for use in iron production as a
principal product. The reference scenario includes emissions in the “processes” box
based on the EU ETS benchmark value for producing coke, and emissions in the
“combustion (principal products)” box based on combustion emissions for the coke.
21 The processes and emissions covered by the EU ETS product benchmarks can be found in the “Guidance
Document n°9 on the harmonized free allocation methodology for the EU-ETS post 2020 Sector-specific
guidance” available at https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2019-
07/p4_gd9_sector_specific_guidance_en.pdf
54EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
“End of life (principal products)”. The EU ETS benchmarks do not include emissions
associated with the end of life of principal products. These should be included in the
dedicated box following the provisions in section 2.2.9.
Example: For a project producing ethylene glycol, emissions calculated using the
EU ETS benchmark value will be included in the “processes” box of the reference
scenario, but this does not include end of life emissions associated with the carbon
contained in the product. The emissions from conversion of the carbon in the
ethylene glycol to carbon dioxide at end of life should be included in the “end of life
(principal products)” box.
2.2.4.2 Case 2: An appropriate reference scenario can be constructed from a combination
of EU ETS product benchmarks and other benchmarks sub-installation
Where the conventional processes required to provide the same functions as the principal
product(s) do not correspond directly to an EU ETS product benchmark, it may be possible
to construct an appropriate reference scenario by combining the existing product
benchmark with the EU ETS fallback benchmarks sub-installations. In other words, when
the boundaries of the project scenario do not coincide with an EU ETS product benchmark
in the reference scenario, other EU ETS fallback sub-installations can be added to the
“processes” box in the reference scenario to balance the scenarios.
In these cases, the relevant EU ETS product benchmark plus additional fallback sub-
installation(s) shall be added to the “processes” box in the reference scenario to properly
reflect the set of processes required to provide the same or equivalent function(s).
There are three types of other EU ETS fallback benchmarks sub-installations22:
25F
• heat benchmark sub-installations.
• fuel benchmark sub-installations.
• process emissions sub-installations.
Heat benchmark sub-installations shall be added to the “processes” box of the reference
scenario to account for additional heat used to produce an equivalent quantity of principal
products in the reference scenario, beyond the amount of heat already covered by any of
the EU ETS product benchmark required.
Fuel benchmark sub-installations shall be added to the “processes” box of the reference
scenario to account for additional fuel use to produce an equivalent quantity of principal
products in the reference scenario, beyond the fuel use already covered by any of the EU
ETS product benchmark required.
Process emissions sub-installations may be added to cover any emissions occurring in the
“processes” box of the reference scenario not already covered by any of the EU ETS product
benchmark required.
Example: A project manufacturing cold drawn steel bars may be able to construct
a reference scenario in which the “processes” box is based on combination of the
product benchmark for hot metal and a fuel benchmark sub-installation reflecting
additional fuel consumption for the drawing process.
22 The applicable EU act is Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/447 of 12 March 2021 determining
revised benchmark values for free allocation of emission allowances for the period from 2021 to 2025
pursuant to Article 10a(2) of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, available
at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2021/447. All the guidance documents are here:
https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/allowances_en#tab-0-1 (make sure to scroll down to 2021-2030).
55EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Example: A project manufacturing sodium bicarbonate may be able to construct a
reference scenario in which the “processes” box is based on the combination of the
EU ETS benchmark for soda ash and a fuel benchmark sub-installation reflecting
additional fuel consumption for reacting soda ash with water and CO to produce
2
sodium bicarbonate.
All assumptions made in the characterisation of these additional sub-installations should
be clearly stated and justified (for example in determining whether to assume that
additional energy is supplied as heat, fuel or electricity), and the applicant should provide
a reasonable characterisation of normal practice in the conventional production process.
When a decision must be made between two alternatives that are both equally
representative of the current practice, the reference scenario should always reflect the
lower GHG emissions option (i.e., the most conservative).
Example: If there is a choice between assuming that an additional process would
be powered with electricity from the grid (zero emissions under the InnovFund
calculation methodology for energy-intensive industry projects) or by adding an
additional fuel benchmark sub-installation, then it should be assumed that power
would be taken from the grid.
Electricity consumption (see Table 1.3) is treated as having zero GHG emissions in energy
intensive industry projects. Therefore, any additional electricity consumption not covered
by the EU ETS product benchmark sub-installations should be included with zero emission
factor for transparency.
The reference scenario shall include emissions in additional boxes that the EU ETS product
benchmarks and other benchmarks sub-installation do not cover, such as “inputs”, “Non-
principal products”, “Combustion (principal products)”, and “End of life (principal
products)”. See related guidance in section 2.2.4.1.
2.2.4.3 Case 3: Modifications to existing production systems
A project may be treated as a modification of an existing production system if emissions
reductions are delivered by modifying one or more units or processes in an existing system
in an innovative way, without simply replacing the main processes of the system and
without changing the principal product that is produced by the system, and that is used to
determine the sector of the application.
Projects that add carbon capture units to existing installations without changing the
products from those installations must be treated as modifications to the existing
system.
If the CAPEX associated with a project is more than a third of the CAPEX that would be
required to develop a whole new production facility, then the project cannot be treated
as a modification of an existing system.
A project in which only inputs are changed does not qualify as a modification to an
existing system.
Example: In the diagram below Companies 2 and 3 jointly submit a project to use
additional renewable electricity to produce hydrogen (the intermediate product) for
making ammonia (the principal product), replacing hydrogen from an existing
steam methane reformer in the existing ammonia plant.
56EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
In a joint application, the project can be defined as a modification to the ammonia
plant, as the hydrogen production unit is only a part of the production system.
Therefore, the reference scenario may be taken to be the existing ammonia
production plant, subject to the rules for modified plants detailed above.
Alternatively, company 3 could propose the project alone. The hydrogen coming out
of the pipe from the electrolyser (company 2) would now be treated as an input
(from ‘outside’ the system boundary). Company 3 would therefore not be permitted
to treat this project as a modification to an existing production system, unless there
were other innovative changes being made to the ammonia production system. The
reference scenario would be the EU ETS benchmark for ammonia (see case 1 in
section 2.2.4.1 above) ), and the relevant emission factor for the hydrogen used as
an input in the project scenario is 6.84 tCO2e/tH2 (see also example 2 in section
1.4.3.2). Note that this option prevents the applicant from claiming emission
avoidance associated to the production of hydrogen, since it occurs outside the
project boundaries.
Finally, if company 2 applied alone, then the principal product is hydrogen. In this
case it would also not be possible to treat the project as a modification of an existing
plant, and the reference scenario would be the EU ETS benchmark for hydrogen
(see case 1 in section 2.2.4.1 above).
In some cases, identifying a project as a modification will depend on the choice of principal
product.
Example: if a steam methane reformer at an oil refinery is replaced with an
electrolyser and the principal product is identified as hydrogen, this could not be
treated as a modification as the main element of the hydrogen production system
is entirely replaced.
If, however, refined hydrocarbon fuels were treated as the principal product then
the project could be treated as a modification in the context of this wider production
system, which should then be included within the project boundaries in both the
reference and project scenario.
Applicants must provide justification to support the decision to treat a project as a
modification to an existing production system. If the applicant incorrectly identifies a
project as a modification of an existing production system, or does not provide sufficient
justification, this may affect the assessment of the quality of the GHG calculations.
Rules for modified production systems: When a project is identified as a modification
of an existing production system, the applicant may be permitted to take the unmodified
processes as the reference scenario, rather than the relevant EU ETS benchmark(s), under
the following conditions:
• The emissions in the project scenario must be lower than the emissions in the reference
scenario, otherwise the modification would not make sense from the GHG emissions
avoidance perspective.
57EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
• Where modifications are made to at least one sub-process of a process corresponding
to an EU ETS product benchmark, then the total of emissions for that modified process
should be lower than the respective EU ETS product benchmark emissions.23
26F
• If a project produces only one principal product and it is associated with an EU ETS
product benchmark, then the GHG emissions from the modified production system must
be below the EU ETS product benchmark emissions for the relevant quantity of that
principal product. This requirement is not relevant to cases where there is not a
corresponding EU ETS product benchmark for at least one principal product of the
project.
• When comparing the “processes” emissions in a modification project to an EU ETS
product benchmark, the benchmark must be chosen based on the modified plant, which
may be different to the relevant EU ETS benchmark for the unmodified plant.
Example: the existing, unmodified facilities operate a blast furnace steel production.
The project would replace the blast furnace capacity with electric arc furnace (EAF)
capacity. EAF processes only scrap steel, not iron ore, and therefore is a
fundamentally less CO intensive technology (hence the total of emissions for the
2
modified process EAF has a much lower EU ETS benchmark than 'hot metal'). For
the benchmark comparison: the project “processes” emissions should be below
those for a benchmark EAF facility.
Note that this project modification would also cause a change in the inputs from
iron ore to scrap steel. Scrap steel should be assessed as a rigid input (see section
2.2.6.4), which may result in additional emissions being assigned in the “inputs”
box following the modification.
• When defining the reference scenario based on an existing production system, the
applicant shall identify inputs in the “inputs” box. The other boxes shall also be used
as required.
Note that, in the definition of the reference and project scenario, and the calculation of
reference and project emissions, it is necessary to include also emissions that are the
same in both scenarios as their exclusion would alter the relative emissions savings
result. This applies also to the case in which some of the inputs are the same in the
reference and project scenarios in terms of volumes and associated emissions.
2.2.4.4 Case 4: Transport fuel substitutes
For projects with a principal product that replaces (i.e. provides an equivalent function to)
a conventional transport fuel, the reference scenario shall be based on the “IF fossil fuel
comparator”24 (emission factors) of the substituted fuel(s) defined in Table 2.2. This
27F
includes projects producing novel transport fuels falling under the definition of biofuels,
renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs), or recycled carbon fuels (RCFs) under
REDII.
Proposals must credibly justify the intended use of the product as a substitute transport
fuel, for example by providing draft contracts with distributors, letters of intent, or other
relevant supporting documents.
For projects producing fuels for which transport is not the most common application, such
as hydrogen, electricity, natural gas, natural gas substitutes, etc., a reference scenario
23 Summed in both cases for the years of operation of the project.
24 For fuels that are blended into fossil transport fuel or used as their direct replacements in existing unmodified
vehicle engines, the equivalent quantity of the substituted fuel is that with an equal lower heating value
(LHV; = net calorific value, NCV). For fuels (such as hydrogen) used in heavily modified vehicles, the
equivalent quantity of substituted fuel is that which provides the same transport function (i.e. delivers the
same kilometres x tonne of load), derived from v5 of the JEC-WTW report.
58EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
based on a fossil fuel comparator can only be chosen if the project includes specific actions
and tasks to supply the fuel produced to the final user for the intended application, for
example through the construction and operation of hydrogen refuelling stations that will
supply the hydrogen produced to fuel cell vehicles. See section 1.2 for further guidance.
The emissions for the equivalent quantity of substituted conventional fuel(s) shall be
included in the “combustion (principal products)” box of the reference scenario and
based on the relevant IF fossil fuel comparators25. In this case no emissions need to be
28F
included in the processes box of the reference scenario as the relevant processing
emissions are already included in the fossil fuel comparators. This approach also applies to
projects producing synthetic crude oil as a principal product, for which a specific fossil fuel
comparator is provided in Table 2.2.
For projects using a fossil fuel comparator as the reference scenario, the combustion
emissions of the novel fuel (if any) must be included in the “combustion (principal
products)” box of the project scenario. This must include any CH or N O emissions
4 2
29F
associated with combustion of the fuel in a relevant vehicle. Lower Heating Values (LHV),
also called Net Calorific Values (NCV), shall be used for the different fuels as provided in
Table 2.2.

Source: JRC elaboration of data from JEC-WTW report v5.
For fuels used in highly modified vehicles, such as hydrogen for fuel cell cars, the applicant
shall take into account a change in vehicle efficiency based on typical vehicle efficiencies
documented in JEC-WTW report v.5 (matching the function provided as detailed above).
If the fuel or transport mode (e.g., maritime, aircraft) is not dealt with in JEC-WTW report
v.5, the relative efficiency compared to fossil fuels in conventional vehicles is found from
the hierarchy of data sources in Appendix 1. If the fuels will be used in vessels or aircraft
25 Note that the InnovFund fossil fuel comparator differs from comparator values used in the REDII because the
InnovFund methodology (in order to align with EU ETS) does not consider the emissions from extraction and
transport of crude oil, nor the transport and distribution of the final fuel. Specifically in the InnovFund
methodology, the FFCs include: Combustion emissions + Transformation near market (crude refining). The
FFCs do not include: production and conditioning at source (crude oil production), transformation at source,
transportation to market (crude oil transport), conditioning and distribution (distribution and dispensing at
retail site). FFCs include CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions.
26 The FFCs are not to be used as emissions factors for these fuels when combusted for process energy – in that
case, combustion-only emission factors should be used, as stated in section 2.2.5.
59EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
and the applicant wants to include other non-CO climate impacts (e.g., black carbon),
2
then the applicant may submit a hybrid application as detailed in section 1.2.5.5.
When the novel fuel is physically different with respect to the relevant fossil fuel
comparator, the project shall include in the “processes” box emissions associated to the
distribution of the novel (unblended) fuel to the vehicles, as detailed in section 1.4.5.
No inputs nor non-principal products shall be included in the reference scenario for this
case. No additional emissions shall be recorded in the “combustion (principal products)” or
“end of life (principal products)” boxes of the reference scenario.
Simplification for PILOTS topic projects: For the purposes of GHG calculations, PILOTS
projects are not expected to submit letters of intent or other supporting documents when
claiming the intended use of their product. However, applicants shall credibly justify their
claim at the application stage, and will need to demonstrate the actual use of the product
as a transport fuel substitute during project implementation.
2.2.4.5 Case 5: Natural gas substitutes
For projects producing natural gas substitute products (e.g., biomethane, synthetic
methane), unless the project includes specific actions and tasks to use the product in a
specific application, the emissions for the equivalent quantity of substituted natural gas,
calculated as equal energy content on a lower heating value basis, shall be included in the
“processes” box of the reference scenario based on the combustion emissions intensity
(i.e. emission factor) of natural gas (56.2 gCO e/MJ).
2
If the project involves specific actions or tasks to use the natural gas substitute to fulfil an
identified function (e.g. to enable supply for natural gas vehicles replacing the function of
liquid fossil fuels or for an identified industrial use replacing the function of a different fuel),
then a different case may be used so that the reference scenario reflects emissions
associated with providing that equivalent function. The emission factor for this function
may be different from a natural gas combustion reference. The choice of a reference
scenario and emission factor different than the standard one, subject to the conditions
detailed above, must be credibly justified by the applicant.
Example: A project produces renewable gas fed into the natural gas grid with no
specific actions and tasks related to, nor investments in, a specific product use. The
reference for the natural gas fed into the gas grid would be the general combustion
emissions intensity of 56.2 gCO e/MJ.
2
Example: A project produces renewable gas and supplies it to a steel plant. The
applicant does not foresee action and tasks, nor investments, related to the steel
making process. The reference would be the general natural gas combustion
emissions intensity of 56.2 gCO e/MJ.
2
Example: A project produces renewable gas and includes specific actions and tasks
related to the construction and operation of fuelling stations to supply the gas for
heavy duty transport. The applicant may use Case 4: Transport Fuel Substitutes
and use the diesel fossil fuel comparator as the reference (80.4 gCO e/MJ, Table
2
2.2), taking into account the relative efficiency of natural gas and diesel heavy duty
engines. The project scenario shall include emissions associated with distribution of
the produced gas to the fuelling station.
No inputs nor non-principal products shall be included in the reference scenario for this
case. No additional emissions shall be recorded in the “combustion (principal products)” or
“end of life (principal products)” boxes of the reference scenario.
60EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
2.2.4.6 Case 6: The principal product can be synthesised from natural gas and a life-
cycle emissions value is available in the data hierarchy
For projects where the principal product provides a function that replaces conventional
carbon-based fuels or chemicals for which reference scenarios cannot be proposed under
cases 1, 3, 4 or 527 it is allowed to take as a reference scenario a life-cycle28 emission
32F 33F
factor drawn from the hierarchy of data sources in Appendix 1, provided that the emission
factor is based on a process with natural gas as the main feedstock (e.g., synthesis of
methanol, formaldehyde, acetic acid).
In general, life-cycle emission factors from the data hierarchy may be expected to include
the carbon contained within the product. If a value does not include carbon contained
within the product, then that amount of carbon shall be added to the emission value from
the data hierarchy on a stoichiometric basis. The resulting value can be used as a single
emission factor associated to the production of the relevant principal product in the
“processes” box of the reference scenario.
No inputs nor non-principal products shall be included in the reference scenario for this
case. No additional emissions shall be recorded in the “combustion (principal products)” or
“end of life (principal products)” boxes of the reference scenario, because release of the
carbon contained in the product shall be included in the emission factor in the “processes”
box.
Several chemicals that can be produced by steam cracking of natural gas liquids fall on the
'high value chemicals' (HVC) list in the ETS29. However, they may be produced in ratios
35F
that do not meet the HVC definition, and therefore the EU ETS HVC benchmark may not
be used to define the relevant reference scenario. In that case, the applicants shall propose
a reference scenario based on a lifecycle emission value for the relevant chemical from the
hierarchy of data sources (Appendix 1) and operate under case 6. The value proposed must
be based on steam cracking of natural gas liquids. For example, it is not permissible to
propose a reference scenario under case 6 based on steam cracking of naphtha.
Example: A project will produce propylene as the sole principal product.
The EU ETS benchmark for “Steam cracking (high value chemicals)” states that it
applies to processes, "with an ethylene content in the total product mix of at least
30 mass-percent and a content of HVC, fuel gas, butenes and liquid hydrocarbons
of together at least 50 mass-percent of the total product mix". As the project
produces no ethylene, this benchmark may not be used as a reference.
The applicant shall look through sources in the data hierarchy (Appendix 1) to find
a lifecycle emission value for propylene production from steam cracking of natural
gas liquids and use that value as their reference scenario.
Note that the reference scenario shall consider the function of the principal products of the
project. For example, a fossil fuel comparator may still be the correct reference scenario
even for a chemically distinct principal product, if that product will be used as a transport
fuel, if applicable under the conditions detailed in sub-section 2.2.4.4.
Example: If methanol will be supplied for use as a transport fuel in maritime
applications, under the conditions set in sub-section 2.2.4.4, the reference scenario
shall be based on the fossil fuel comparator for maritime fuel (section 2.2.4.4), and
not on methanol production. Applicants must convincingly establish that the
27 I.e. the principal product does not replace any of: natural gas; fuels with fossil fuel comparator values (such
as gasoline or diesel); or products with EU ETS product benchmarks.
28 A life-cycle emission factor includes emissions associated with the production of the product. The
stoichiometric combustion emission factors given in IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories do not constitute life-cycle emission values.
29 Acetylene, ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene.
61EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
methanol willl be used for maritime transport, and the project shall include
emissions associated to the methanol distribution to the vessels.
2.2.4.7 Case 7: Direct air capture or capture of naturally occurring CO for CCS
2
Where a project consists solely of the installation of a direct air capture facility, with the
captured CO sent for permanent storage, then the reference scenario emissions shall be
2
set to zero. For such projects, it is not possible to use equations 1.2 and 1.3. Therefore,
the relative GHG emission avoidance shall be set equal to 100% as specified in section
1.1.4, and the adjusted relative GHG emission avoidance shall be set equal to 200% as
specified in section 1.1.5.
Where a project consists solely of the installation of a facility to capture naturally released
geological CO (e.g. from a geyser), with the captured CO sent for permanent storage,
2 2
then the reference scenario emissions shall be set to zero. For such projects, it is not
possible to use equations 1.2 and 1.3. Therefore, the relative GHG emission avoidance
shall be set equal to 100% as specified in section 1.1.4, and the adjusted relative GHG
emission avoidance shall be set equal to 200% as specified in section 1.1.5. This case does
not apply if the emission of CO was stimulated by human intervention. If geological CO
2 2
is released due to a project to generate geothermal energy, then a project to capture that
CO should apply in category/sector RES/geothermal energy and follow the provisions of
2
section 3.
See section 2.2.5.2, section 2.2.5.3 and section 6 for additional guidance on CCU/S.
2.2.4.8 Case 8: Storage and/or transport of captured CO
2
For projects that involve only the storage and/or transport of CO that is captured outside
2
the boundary for the project, the reference emissions shall be set as the quantity of CO
2
entering the system boundary, appearing as a positive emission term.
No distinction shall be made between CO of fossil, atmospheric or biogenic origin in this
2
case. For an applicant to gain recognition within the GHG calculation for the biogenic origin
of the CO , then the capture of that CO must be within the project scope and system
2 2
boundary, and this reference case would not apply.
See section 2.2.5.2.2 and section 6 for additional guidance on projects that involve only
the storage or transport of CO that is captured outside the boundary for the project.
2
2.2.4.9 Case 9: The applicant proposes a reference scenario
Only for projects whose principal products cannot be given reference scenarios using any
of the cases detailed above, the applicant may propose a reference scenario based on
either a life-cycle analysis sourced from appropriate literature or based on a life-cycle
analysis undertaken or commissioned by the applicants themselves.
The applicant must credibly justify the choice to resort to Case 9, and why the other cases
described above could not be applied. In general, the applicant must select an appropriate
reference scenario which delivers the same quantity or function as the principal product
in the project scenario, and credibly justify and present the assumptions and calculations
made.
When defining the reference scenario, the applicant shall identify relevant inputs in the
“inputs” box and use the other boxes as appropriate. In the definition of the reference and
project scenario, and in the calculation of reference and project emissions, it is necessary
to include also emissions that are the same in both scenarios. This applies also to the case
in which some of the inputs are the same in the reference and project scenarios in terms
of volumes and associated emissions. The emissions of biogenic CO from combustion of
2
biofuels shall not be considered.
62EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
In applying Case 9, the applicant must apply the provisions of the hierarchy of data sources
(Appendix 1) to select appropriate emission factors and references. Deviations from the
hierarchy, for example the choice of a value from a source lower in the hierarchy when a
value is available at a higher source, must be well justified.
The specific sources should, as far as possible, be consistent with the principles of EU ETS
benchmarking. Applicants shall not define a reference scenario with artificially high
emissions when lower-emission alternatives are available that are also more consistent
with the principles of EU ETS benchmarking and more realistic.
The applicants should calculate the direct GHG emissions for the combination of
processes in the project scenario using calculation methods which are in line with the
Monitoring and Reporting Regulation (MRR)30. The derogations in Article 27(a) of the EU
36F
ETS Directive and Article 47 of the MRR relating to installations with low emissions are not
relevant in the context of the Innovation Fund.
2.2.5 Emissions from processes
For the project scenario, the applicant must include in the “processes” box all the
emissions expected within the system boundary of the project associated with the
processes required to produce the chosen principal product(s) or delivering its function
(section 1.2). The set of processes to be assessed in the “processes” box are defined by
the system boundary (section 2.2.3).
• The “processes box” must include all emissions of CO or other greenhouse
2
gases occurring due to fuel combustion or other chemical or biological
processes within the project boundary, remembering that any emission of biogenic
CO should be recorded, but shall be treated as having a zero emission factor, while
2
emissions of non-CO greenhouse gases (e.g. CH and N O) must be considered
2 4 2
with the appropriate emission factor.
• When fuels are combusted in the project scenario (or otherwise consumed to
release their chemical energy e.g. in a fuel cell) an emission term must be included,
based on the relevant reference indicated in the hierarchy of sources. For the case
of fossil fuels, this generally means combustion emissions for a relevant case
documented in tables 2.2 and 2.3 of Vol.2 Energy of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.31 The combustion emissions must include
expected generation of CH and N O.
4 2
• The “processes box” must also include any expected biogas or methane
leakage occurring within the project boundary. Leakages should be predicted
based on standard rates for the type of facility/equipment proposed. See also
section 1.1.7 and section 1.4.6
• Emissions associated with transport must be considered and included in the
“processes” box in the cases specified in section 1.4.5.
• GHG emissions associated with any processes that produce non-principal products
from the project should also be included in the “processes” box, as they are within
the system boundary. The credit for supplying non-principal products is dealt with
separately in the “non-principal products” box (section 2.2.10).
• Inputs from processes that are outside the system boundary are to be dealt with in
the “inputs” box (section 2.2.6).

63EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
The reference scenario includes in the “processes” box emissions from all processes
associated with producing the same quantity of the principal product(s) or meeting the
same functions as the principal product(s). Refer also to section 2.2.4 for relevant
provisions concerning the definition of an appropriate reference scenario.
Note for applicants familiar with earlier versions of the methodology: The credit
for carbon capture has been moved from the processes box and is now included in the
calculation through Equation 1.1 (see section 1.1.3).
2.2.5.1 Changes in emissions from waste processing
If a process produces waste, emissions from the processing of waste – waste handling
emissions belong to the “processes” box.
Example: An innovative process (project scenario) may eliminate a waste stream that
conventionally (reference scenario) requires energy -intensive treatment.
2.2.5.2 Projects with an element of CCS
Projects that involve capture of CO for storage, transport of CO to a storage site, and/or
2 2
storage of CO in a permanent storage site can calculate a carbon capture credit in
2
accordance with section 6.
In the case that CO capture and storage occur in the reference scenario (this may occur,
2
for example, under Case 3: Modification to an existing production system), this must also
be taken into account by the inclusion of an appropriate separate carbon capture credit for
the reference scenario (See section 6 for more guidance on calculating this credit).
2.2.5.2.1 Projects that capture CO from within the system boundary, for storage
2
Projects that capture some or all of the CO produced by processes within the system
2
boundary and transfer it for storage must include the full amount of CO produced by
2
those processes as an emission term within the processes box of the project
scenario even though some of this CO is to be captured. Credit for the capture and
2
subsequent storage of the CO is then given by the separate calculation of a carbon capture
2
credit following the rules in section 6 (cf. Equation [1.1]).
Fossil CO will appear as a positive emission term, while biogenic CO shall be reported
2 2
with an emission factor of zero.
The reference emissions shall be calculated as for any EII project using the methodology
as detailed in this section 2, and choosing the appropriate case as detailed in section 2.2.4.
• Projects that add carbon capture units to existing installations without changing the
products from those installations must be treated as modifications to the
existing system (Case 3, section 2.2.4.3).
• Projects consisting of CCS based on direct air capture (DACCS), in which CO is
2
captured from the atmosphere rather than from an industrial process, shall apply
under category “EII” and sector “other” with the principal product identified as “CO
2
storage”. The reference scenario emissions for a DACCS project shall be zero (Case
7, section 2.2.4.7).
• Projects consisting of CO capture for geological storage from natural geological
2
sources (e.g. a geyser) shall apply under category “EII” and sector “other” with the
principal product identified as “CO storage”. The reference scenario emissions for
2
such a project shall be zero (Case 7, section 2.2.4.7).
If, however, a project causes the release of geological CO which would otherwise
2
have stayed underground (e.g., by sourcing geothermal steam from a reservoir
64EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
where the steam is mixed with CO ), and then captures the released CO , then the
2 2
CO that is released as a result of the project activities must appear as a positive
2
term in the project scenario, including the portion of CO that will later be captured.
2
If geological CO is released due to a project to generate geothermal energy, then
2
a project to capture that CO should apply in category/sector RES/geothermal
2
energy and follow the provisions of section 3.
2.2.5.2.2 Projects that transport and/or store CO that was captured outside the system
2
boundary
Projects that transport and/or geologically store CO captured outside the system boundary
2
of the project shall include the full amount of CO being brought into the system
2
boundary as a positive emission term in the processes box of both the reference
and project scenario. This applies even though this CO will not be emitted in the project
2
scenario (excepting any fugitive, vented or leaked emissions). Credit for storage of the CO
2
is then given by the separate calculation of a carbon capture credit following the rules in
section 6 (cf. Equation [1.1]).
Irrespectively of its origin (e.g., fossil, biogenic, geological, or atmospheric), the captured
CO will appear as a positive emission term in both the reference and project scenario.
2
Additional credit associated to the biogenic origin of the CO cannot be claimed if the CO
2 2
is captured outside of the system boundaries of the project. In this case, the origin of the
CO or the nature of the processes from which it is captured makes no difference to the
2
GHG calculations.
In line with the approach described above, the emissions in the processes box of the
reference scenario shall be set according to Case 8: Storage or transport of captured CO
2
(section 2.2.4.8) as the amount of CO entering the project boundary (i.e. the reference
2
scenario is set as if the CO would be released in the absence of the project).
2
2.2.5.3 Projects with an element of CCU
Projects that will use captured CO by incorporating it in a product can calculate a carbon
2
capture credit in accordance with section 6. The CO may be captured within the system
2
boundary of the project or brought in from outside the boundaries of the project.
In the case that CO capture and utilisation occur in the reference scenario (this may occur,
2
for example, under Case 3: Modification to an existing production system), this must also
be taken into account by the inclusion of an appropriate separate carbon capture credit for
the reference scenario (See section 6 for more guidance).
2.2.5.3.1 Projects that capture CO from within the system boundary, for use
2
Projects that capture some or all of the CO produced by processes within the system
2
boundary and utilise it or transfer it for utilisation must include the full amount of CO
2
produced by those processes as an emission term within the processes box of the
project scenario even though some of this CO is to be captured and utilised. Credit
2
for the capture and subsequent utilisation of the CO is then given by the calculation of a
2
separate carbon capture credit following the rules in section 6 (cf. Equation [1.1]).
Fossil CO will appear as a positive emission term, while biogenic CO shall be reported
2 2
with an emission factor of zero. As with CCS (see section 2.2.5.2.1), if the source of the
captured CO is atmospheric carbon or naturally released geological carbon, there is no
2
requirement to include a positive emission term, unless the project causes the release of
geological CO which would otherwise have stayed underground. The reference emissions
2
shall be calculated as for any EII project using the methodology as detailed in this section
2, and choosing the appropriate case as detailed in section 2.2.4.
65EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Both the process from which the CO is captured and the process in which CO is
2 2
used shall be included within the system boundary of the project: both processes
must be included in the GHG calculations, and the applicant must provide a full
characterization of both. At least one of the products of the process from which the CO is
2
captured, and one of the CCU products, must be set as a co-principal product of the project,
and the principal product which is the main aim of the project shall be identified following
the provisions in section 1.2.3. Non-principal CCU products, if any, may be included in the
project scenario following the provisions in section 2.2.10.
Example: A project will add carbon capture to an existing steel plant, the steel plant
is within the system boundary of the project and steel is set as one of the principal
products of the project. The captured CO will be used in an e-fuel production facility
2
built and operated by the applicant as part of the project.
The CO generated by the steel plant is included as an emission term in the
2
processes box of the project scenario even though part of it will be captured, and a
carbon capture credit will be included in Equation [1.1] based on the amount of
carbon incorporated in the e-fuel, following the rules in section 6.
The applicant must include the e-fuel plant within the system boundary and fully
characterise it as part of the GHG calculations. The produced e-fuel must be set as
a co-principal product of the project, and the principal product which is the main
aim of the project must be identified following the provisions in section 1.2.3.
In the case in which CO is captured by the applicant within the project scope, and it is
2
then transferred to a third party for use purposes, outside the project scope, the applicant
must include the CO utilisation process within the boundaries of its calculations, including
2
inputs to the CO2 utilisation process, and the combustion or end-of-life emissions of CCU
products, following the provisions in this and other relevant sub-sections.
Example: A project will add carbon capture to an existing steel plant, the steel plant
is within the system boundary of the project and steel is set as one of the principal
products of the project. The captured CO will be used in an e-fuel production facility
2
built and operated by a third party and outside the scope of the project.
The CO generated by the steel plant is included as an emission term in the
2
processes box of the project scenario even though part of it will be captured, and a
carbon capture credit will be included in Equation [1.1] based on the amount of
carbon incorporated in the e-fuel, following the rules in section 6.
The applicant must include the e-fuel plant within the system boundary and fully
characterise it as part of the GHG calculations. The produced e-fuel must be set as
a co-principal product of the project, and the principal product which is the main
aim of the project must be identified following the provisions in section 1.2.3.
2.2.5.3.2 Projects that use CO that was captured outside the system boundary
2
If the CO is brought in from outside the project boundaries, then all the processes used
2
to produce the CCU products and their associated emissions must be included within the
system boundary of the project scenario. At least one of the products of the CCU process
must be set as a principal product of the project.
In this case, there is no need to include a positive emission term for CO production in the
2
“processes” box. This means that for CO produced outside the system boundary it
2
makes no difference to any part of the calculation whether the source of the CO
2
is biogenic, fossil, atmospheric or geological.
66EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Example: A project will use CO captured from a steel plant for e-fuel production.
2
Both the steel plant and the carbon capture unit are outside of the system boundary:
they are operated by a third party (not part of the consortium) from whom the
applicant purchases the CO that enters the project as an input.
2
The CO generated by the steel plant is not included as an emission term in the
2
processes box of the project scenario. The applicant must include the e-fuel plant
within the system boundary and set the produced e-fuel as a principal product. A
carbon capture credit may be included in Equation [1.1] based on the amount of
carbon incorporated in the e-fuel, following the rules in section 6.
The reference emissions shall be calculated as for any EII project using the methodology
as detailed in this section 2, and choosing the appropriate case following the provisions in
section 2.2.4, based on which reference product is replaced by the CCU product produced
by the project.
Non-principal CCU products, if any, may be included in the project scenario following the
provisions in section 2.2.10.
2.2.5.3.3 Combustion / end of life emissions of CCU fuels and products
If CCU principal products are to be combusted for energy (e.g. in the case of e-fuels
produced using captured CO ), then the emissions from this combustion shall be included
2
in the project scenario just as they would be for non-CCU products (section 2.2.7). This
provision applies also in the cases in which a third-party CO utilisation process has been
2
brought within the system boundaries of the project (see section 2.2.5.3.1).
Similarly, if CCU principal products are not combusted for energy, then the emission at end
of life shall be included in the project scenario just as they would be for non-CCU products
(section 2.2.9).
Combustion and end-of-life emissions for CCU products are not affected by the original
fossil or biogenic status of the captured CO , i.e. combustion and end of life emissions
2
for CCU products shall not be treated as zero even if the CO was originally captured from
2
a biogenic source.
Example: a project aims to produce methanol using CO captured from waste
2
gasification, with a waste composition of 70% biogenic carbon and 30% fossil
carbon. The methanol is a principal product.
If the methanol is supplied as a fuel, then the release of the contained carbon shall
be recorded as an emission under “combustion (principal products)”. The original
status of the captured CO as partly biogenic does not affect the calculation of this
2
emission term, which shall be equal to the full GHG emissions from combustion of
the methanol.
If the methanol is supplied as a chemical, then the release of the contained carbon
shall be recorded as an emission under “end of life (principal products)”. The original
status of the captured CO as partlybiogenic does not affect the calculation of this
2
emission term, which shall be equal to the full CO emissions from stoichiometric
2
combustion of the methanol.
2.2.6 Emissions from inputs
The applicant must specify the inputs that enter the system boundary (see section 2.2.3)
and are used by processes in the “processes” box of the project or the reference scenarios.
This shall include all energy and material inputs, with the following exceptions:
67EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
• Fossil fuels combusted (or otherwise consumed to release their chemical energy
e.g. in a fuel cell) within the system boundary are an exception, as emissions due
to extraction, processing, refining, distribution and storage of fossil fuels that are
combusted for energy production by the project (or otherwise consumed to release
their chemical energy e.g. in a fuel cell) are excluded from the calculation in line
with section 1.1.7, and emissions from the combustion of fuels are included in the
“processes” box (see 2.2.5). Fossil fuels shall therefore only be included in the
“inputs” box if they are used as a non-combusted chemical input.
• In cases where solid materials are reshaped, reformed or assembled into a product
by the project but remain largely unchanged in their chemical composition or
structure they may not be treated as inputs. Such cases need to be well justified
by the applicant.
Example: A project consists of working steel into parts for machinery. The steel
used shall not be treated as an input, and therefore emissions associated to the
production of the steel that is reshaped by the project will not be included in either
the project or reference scenario.
Example: A project consists of applying a coating to steel components. The steel
component to which the coating is applied shall not be treated as an input, since it
is simply the support to which coating is applied, and therefore steel production
emissions will not be included in either the project or reference scenario.
The emissions factors for electricity, hydrogen and heat used as inputs are stated in
section 1.4.3. Electricity consumed in either the project or reference scenario shall be
assigned an emission factor of zero, with the following two exceptions:
• Projects in which an existing production system is modified by means of specific
innovative technologies that reduce electricity consumption, and this reduction
in electricity consumption is the only change (i.e. there is no change to the products
of the system, to the use of non-electrical energy or to the consumption of inputs
other than those associated with the reduced electricity consumption).
In this case the reference emissions related to electricity shall be obtained by
multiplying the project net electricity savings by the expected 2030 electricity grid
mix emission factor (48.8 gCO e/MJ [0.176 tCO e/MWh]).
2 2
The electricity-saving projects shall be submitted under the EII sector
determined based on the principal product as normal (section 1.2). It is not
permitted to combine electricity-saving projects with other type of projects under
any category or hybrid projects in a single InnovFund application.
• Projects that time their operation to coincide with periods in which the GHG
intensity of grid electricity is low. This exception is explained in section 2.2.6.6.
Emissions for water provision as an input should be neglected unless water provision
involves desalination, purification, or additional pumping. If one of these is required, then
an emission factor should be chosen from the data hierarchy that reflects the specific water
supply case. For example, if the water is supplied by desalination, then an emission factor
for desalinated water should be found in the data hierarchy.
Other inputs in both scenarios are to be divided into three categories:
Elastic inputs (Section 2.2.6.3) are inputs for which overall production is variable (flexible),
i.e. inputs for which production would be expected to increase as demand increases, and
must be assigned emission factors from the data hierarchy (Appendix 1).
68EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Rigid inputs (Section 2.2.6.4) are inputs for which overall availability is fixed, i.e. inputs
for which production would not be expected to increase even if demand increases. Using
rigid inputs is expected to result in displacement effects due to changes in current use or
disposition of those rigid inputs.
Semi-elastic inputs (Section 2.2.6.5) are inputs that fall between these cases. Rigid inputs
are never directly assigned emission factors from the data hierarchy – instead the applicant
must identify the displacement effects of consuming those rigid (and semi-elastic) inputs.
This may include an increase in demand for an associated elastic input, in which case an
emission factor from the data hierarchy must be identified for that elastic input.
2.2.6.1 Treatment of inputs in the project and reference scenario
The emission factors used for inputs in the GHG emission avoidance calculations should
represent current typical practices. As a fundamental principle, when a project uses the
same or similar inputs in the reference and project scenario, these inputs should be given
the same treatment as elastic, rigid, or semi-elastic, and must be assigned the same
emission factor. A project cannot claim the benefits associated to procuring inputs from a
less carbon-intensive source by assuming a different origin of the same or similar inputs
between the reference and project scenario. Similarly, applicants are not permitted to
adjust emission factors by making alternative assumptions about the upstream emissions
for production of an input or product even if they are able to identify specific details to
more closely represent the process used by their supplier.
In the project scenario, some inputs may be identified as de minimis and disregarded.
as detailed in section 2.2.6.2.
For the reference scenario only, the applicant may choose to simplify the calculation
by ignoring the (positive) emissions of any number of inputs. Note, however, that
ignoring some inputs in the reference scenario would reduce the reportable absolute and
relative GHG emissions avoidance of the project.
Where the reference scenario under ‘Case 1’ (see 2.2.4.1) or ‘Case 2’ (see 2.2.4.2) is based
on one or more EU ETS benchmarks, it includes the emissions covered by EU ETS direct
emissions calculations, but it does not include embedded emissions associated with any
inputs used in those benchmarked processes. The applicant should therefore identify inputs
that would be used in the conventional production system and include them in the “inputs”
box of the reference scenario. In general, the EU ETS benchmark documents do not specify
the quantities of all inputs used in each process, in which case the applicant must provide
a reasonable and well justified estimate. This estimate of inputs quantity may be based on
engineering principles and/or appropriate sources taken from the data hierarchy. The
applicant must explicitly detail the basis for assumptions on quantities of inputs used in
the reference scenario and provide references.
2.2.6.2 Materiality of inputs
The levels of materiality in this section are directly relevant only to elastic inputs in the
project scenario. Rigid inputs and the rigid fraction of semi-elastic inputs are replaced in
the calculations with associated quantities of elastic inputs (which should then be given a
level of materiality) and/or with defined emissions from changed disposition which do not
need to be further adjusted.
The level of materiality of elastic inputs can be major or de minimis. Major inputs must
always be included in the emissions calculations with emission factors derived from
reference literature, according to the method and hierarchy in Appendix 1.
69EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
De minimis inputs
De minimis inputs are elastic inputs that make such a small contribution to the overall
emissions of the project scenario that they may be ignored when assessing emissions
avoidance. Inputs used in very small quantities that would obviously not make a significant
contribution to the GHG emissions profile of the relevant scenario may be stated
generically, e.g., “maintenance materials”, and assigned zero emissions. Any input
estimated as having total associated annual emissions of 10 tCO e or lower during full
2
project operation may be treated as de minimis and ignored.
The applicant may also select from the list of inputs a subset whose emissions jointly
amount to less than 5 % of the total emissions ascribed to the inputs for the whole project
and treat them as de minimis inputs.
For monitoring and reporting for disbursement the selection of de minimis inputs must be
restricted so that their emissions jointly amount to less than 5% of the total emissions
ascribed to the inputs; for monitoring and reporting for knowledge-sharing to less than 2%
of the total emissions ascribed to the inputs.
The emissions of de minimis inputs may be disregarded.
For projects submitted in a Small-Scale or Pilots topic:
The applicant may select from the list of inputs a subset whose emissions jointly amount
to less than 15 % of the total emissions ascribed to the inputs for the whole project and
treat them as de minimis inputs.
2.2.6.3 ELASTIC inputs
If the supply of the input can be increased in order to meet the change in the demand,
then the input is considered “elastic”, and its emission factor is based on the emissions
involved in supplying the extra quantity of that input. The full definition of an elastic input
is given in Appendix 2. Emissions factors for elastic inputs used should be drawn from the
data hierarchy in Appendix 1.
Note that the EU ETS benchmark emission factors may not be used for inputs as the
scope of the EU ETS benchmark calculation is not appropriate for this purpose.
As explained in section 2.2.6.4.1 below, the emissions intensity of a rigid input is based on
identifying the elastic input that replaces the rigid input in its existing use. The provisions
in this section also apply to elastic inputs identified in this way as substitutes for diverted
rigid inputs or diverted semi-elastic inputs.
2.2.6.3.1 Biomass-derived fuels and materials as elastic inputs
The emissions for biomass-derived fuels and materials as elastic inputs are calculated
following the rules in section 1.4.4.
Non-CO greenhouse gas emissions (CH and N O) associated to the combustion or use of
2 4 2
any biomass-derived fuels and materials that is combusted or used as part of the project
must be included in the “processes” box or “combustion (principal products)” box as
appropriate.
Refer to section 2.2.6.4.2 for the treatment of residual and waste biomass resources, which
typically should be treated as rigid inputs.
2.2.6.3.2 Other relevant inputs
For other inputs, GHG emission intensity values must be taken from the reference literature
according to the method and hierarchy in Appendix 1. The applicant must reference and
70EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
justify all the literature values that are used for the emissions factors, so the evaluators
can check them.
If several emission factors are available at the same level of the hierarchy, representing
different processes for obtaining the same product, the applicant shall select the process
that best describes the marginal source (otherwise known as the “swing producer”) of the
input, and must explain the choice.
For inputs containing carbon compounds, life cycle and well-to-wheel databases will often
show total carbon intensity, which is the sum of the stoichiometric carbon content of the
material and all emissions from processes in the supply chain (i.e. the carbon intensity of
the product assuming that its carbon is entirely converted to CO during use/end of life
2
phases). However, including stoichiometric CO release in the emission intensity of the
2
input as well as in the “combustion (principal products)” or “end of life (principal products)”
boxes for the products would result in double counting of those carbon emissions. For
carbon-containing inputs, where the emission factor selected includes the stoichiometric
carbon content, the appropriate emission factors to be used can therefore be found by
subtracting from the total carbon intensity the carbon content of the input converted to
mass of CO using the molar weight ratio 44/12.
2
Example: A project uses hydrochloric acid (HCl) as an input. An emissions intensity
value of 1061.1 gCO e/kg is provided for HCl in the document “Definition of input
2
data to assess GHG default emissions from biofuels in EU legislation” at level 3 of
the data input hierarchy.
Example: A project uses methanol (CH OH) as an input. An emissions intensity
3
value of 97.1 gCO e/MJ is provided for methanol in the document “Definition of
2
input data to assess GHG default emissions from biofuels in EU legislation”, and this
value is subdivided into supply emissions of 28.2 gCO e/MJ and combustion
2
emissions of 68.9 gCO e/MJ. For methanol used as an input, only the supply
2
emissions shall be considered so the emission factor to use is 28.2 gCO e/MJ.
2
Note for applicants from previous calls: previous versions of the methodology included
a requirement to reduce input emission factors by 15% to approximately remove upstream
fossil fuel supply emissions. This requirement has been removed as part of the
simplification of the methodology.
2.2.6.3.3 Attribution of emissions between co-products in the supply of elastic inputs
In some circumstances, it may be necessary to attribute emissions between co-products
of a process in order to determine the GHG emissions intensity of an elastic input. This
would include the case that a major elastic input is one co-product from a process that has
only an overall GHG emissions intensity available in the data hierarchy.
For the purposes of the calculation of attribution of emissions to co-products, the emissions
to be shared shall be all the considered emissions that take place up to, and including, the
process step at which the co-products are produced. If an input to the process is itself a
co-product of another process, the attribution of emissions at the earlier process must be
done first to establish the emissions to be attributed to the input.
ISO 14044 (2006) provides a framework for such an attribution and for calculating the
emissions intensities for the supply of elastic inputs that are co-products of another process
as illustrated in Appendix 3.
2.2.6.4 RIGID inputs
If the input has a fixed supply, which cannot be increased to accommodate additional
demand, then it is considered “rigid”. This means that it can only be supplied to a new
InnovFund project by diverting it from another use or disposition.
71EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
The emission intensity of a rigid input is calculated considering the impact of diverting it
from its existing use (rather than any emissions associated with the generation of the rigid
input itself), plus the emissions associated with any additional treatment and transport.
This means that a rigid input shall never be directly allocated an emission factor from the
data hierarchy. The emissions intensity may be negative (i.e., avoidance of GHG emissions)
if the input was releasing emissions in its existing use/disposition, or positive (i.e.,
additional GHG emissions) if the input was avoiding emissions in its existing use (for
example by reducing demand for other materials).
A product that represents less than 10% of the value of the total products of the
supplier shall be treated as rigid. A product that represents between 10 and 50% of
the value of the total products of the supplier shall be treated as semi elastic, see 2.2.6.5.
This is discussed further in Appendix 2.
Examples of rigid inputs are provided below.
Example: Municipal waste, used plastics, used lubricating oil. For example, taking
municipal waste as an input will not affect the generation of municipal waste, and
therefore it is considered a rigid input. Applicants shall duly document the use or
disposition from which the waste used by the project is diverted from, and shall
calculate the associated emissions following the provisions in section 2.2.6.4.2.
Example: Intermediate streams from existing processes. For example, blast furnace
gas, black liquor. Using industrial off-gases from an existing process will not affect
the generation of off-gases by that process, and therefore it is considered a rigid
input.
Example: Process heat or waste heat32 taken from an existing process. For example,
using excess process heat from an existing process will not affect the generation of
excess heat by that process, and therefore it is considered a rigid input.
2.2.6.4.1 Assessment: diversion emissions
The emissions intensity of a rigid input should consider the impact of diverting it from its
existing use based on one of the following four cases. The applicant should clearly and
explicitly detail in the application the assumptions that have been made with regard to any
rigid inputs.
1. Case 1: The diversion of the rigid input is expected to increase demand for
one or more elastic inputs. In this case, the rigid input should be replaced in the
list of inputs in the “inputs” box with the relevant quantities of these elastic materials,
which should be treated as any other elastic input.
Example: A project uses heat recovered from an existing process, and as a result
extra heat needs to be produced to maintain the supply of heat to other processes.
In this case, the emissions intensity of the heat used is determined by the emission
factor for “heat fed to the project” specified in section 1.4.3.
Example: A project takes as an input industrial off-gas that would otherwise be
combusted to produce process heat. Then the applicant shall consider, in the project
scenario, the emissions incurred to replace the heat lost by diverting the off-gas
from its current use to the project. This can be done by considering the production
of an equivalent amount of heat and using the emission factor for “heat fed to the
project” specified in section 1.4.3.
32 REDII Directive, Article 2 (9):‘waste heat and cold’ means unavoidable heat or cold generated as by-product
in industrial or power generation installations, or in the tertiary sector, which would be dissipated unused in
air or water without access to a district heating or cooling system, where a cogeneration process has been
used or will be used or where cogeneration is not feasible.
72EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
As emissions for electricity used are set to zero, there are no additional emissions
associated to diverting off-gases from electricity production.
2. Case 2: The diversion of the rigid input is expected to increase demand for
other inputs that are rigid or semi-elastic. In this case, the results of diversion of
those other rigid inputs (or the rigid fraction of semi-elastic inputs) should be assessed
in the same way. This should continue until the emissions implications of diverting the
original rigid input have been fully characterised as a combination of increased demand
for elastic inputs and emissions changes due to changes in disposition.
Example: The project used sugar beet molasses as an input. The applicant
determines that molasses should be considered a semi-elastic input (see section
2.2.6.5) as the value of the molasses is estimated by the applicant at 17% of the
overall value from sugar beet processing. The input emission factor will therefore
be calculated as a weighted average of the emissions of producing and processing
additional sugar beet to molasses (elastic part) and the emissions of producing one
or more substitutes (rigid part) in the ratio 7:3333 (see Appendix 2). The molasses
40F
are to be diverted from a yeast production facility controlled by the applicant and
will be replaced by corn steep liquor. Corn steep liquor is a by-product of corn starch
extraction, and is itself considered a rigid input. The applicant identifies glucose
syrup as an elastic substitute for corn steep liquor, and so the final emission factor
for the use of the molasses as an input is a weighted average of the emissions for
molasses production from sugar beet and the emissions for production of glucose
syrup, which should be sourced from the data hierarchy (see Appendix 1).
3. Case 3: The diversion of the rigid input is expected to create no additional
demand for other inputs (i.e. the rigid input would otherwise have been disposed
without productive use). Any change in emissions due to changing the disposition of
the input should be counted as the emissions intensity of the input.
Example: A project uses waste heat as defined by RED. The waste heat was not
previously recovered and is not diverted from a current use. Therefore, it can be
considered as having an emission factor of zero. However, the nature of the heat
must be well characterised and justified by the applicant.
4. Case 4: A combination of the first three outcomes. In this case, the emissions
implications associated with each outcome should be assessed as above, and combined
to give the overall emissions implication of use of the rigid input.
Where a reference scenario includes use of a rigid input, then the logic of the assessment
is reversed. Rather than assessing the expected impacts of diverting an additional amount
of the rigid input, the applicant must assess the expected impacts if the supply of the rigid
input were made available to other uses. In such a case, the result of the assessment will
be some combination of reduced demand for other elastic inputs and emissions that would
result from increased alternative disposition of the input.
2.2.6.4.2 Waste as an input and application of the Waste Framework Directive
Typically, project that involve the use of waste materials (e.g., municipal waste, industrial
waste, used plastics, used lubricating oil) should consider them as rigid inputs, considering
that the additional demand for waste material generated by the project will not increase
the production of waste. Instead, the waste materials used by a project will be diverted
from their current use or disposal, being it landfilling, incineration with or without energy
recovery, recycling, reuse, or other.
33 This ratio is derived as [17%-10%]:[50%-17%].
73EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Projects that involve the use of “waste” materials must respect the waste hierarchy in the
Waste Framework Directive34, which puts top priority on material recycling (e.g., recycling
41F
used plastic as plastic). Converting waste to a fuel is specifically excluded from the
definition of “recycling” in the Waste Framework Directive, and does not count towards
recycling targets for Member States. It is classified as “recovery”, on a lower level of the
waste hierarchy, along with burning for electricity and/or heat production. Therefore,
projects that use as feedstock materials covered in the Waste Framework Directive, such
as used plastics, must precisely define the “waste” they are intending to use, and justify
why it cannot be given a higher-priority treatment under the Waste Framework Directive
during the lifetime of the project.
Applicants shall duly document the use or disposition from which the waste used by the
project is diverted from, and shall calculate the associated emissions following the
provisions in section 2.2.6.4.1, and the additional guidance below:
If waste is diverted from a current use (i.e., the waste used by the project is not currently
landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery), then the diversion of the waste is
expected to increase demand for one or more elastic, rigid, or semi-elastic inputs.
Example (Case 1): A project is using municipal waste as an input, which is diverted
from being burnt to provide district heating. The project shall consider, in the
“inputs” box of the project scenario, the additional positive emissions incurred to
replace that district heat by considering the production of an equivalent amount of
heat and using the emission factor for “heat fed to the project” specified in section
1.4.3.
Example (Case 1): The project diverts waste steel (scrap) from other recycling
operators rather than identifying additional sources of scrap for recycling. Then the
displacement of steel scrap from its current use results in the need to produce more
steel from iron ore. To account for this, the project shall consider, in the “inputs”
box of the project scenario, the additional positive emissions associated to the
production of the additional amount of steel from iron ore.
If the existing fate of the waste is incineration without energy recovery (condition that
the applicants must duly justify and document), then the emissions from incineration are
avoided. This means that the emissions attributed to the waste used as an input are
typically negative resulting in a credit for its novel use.
Emissions associated to the incineration of waste should be calculated based on the
stoichiometric CO emissions from combustion of that amount of waste. However, the CO
2 2
emissions of any biogenic waste must be counted with an emission factor of zero,
so the biogenic fraction of carbon-containing waste would be given an emission factor of
zero when diverted from incineration without energy recovery.
Example (Case 3): If the existing fate of municipal waste is incineration without
energy recovery, then the emissions from the incineration are avoided. This means
the emissions attributed to using the non-biogenic fraction of the waste are negative
(i.e. avoiding the original fate saves emissions, so there is a CO2 credit for its novel
use), while the emissions attributed to using the biogenic fraction of the waste are
zero.
Example (Case 3): If a stream of industrial off-gas containing fossil carbon
monoxide (CO) is diverted from flaring with release of the CO to the atmosphere,
2
34 Directive 2008/98/EC on waste and its amendments.
74EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
and is used as an input in the project, the emission attributed to that input is
negative, equal in magnitude to the CO release that is avoided.
2
If carbon-containing waste is diverted from landfill (condition that the applicants must
duly justify and document), the carbon emissions shall be assumed equal to those for
incineration without energy recovery, meaning that the emission factor attributed to
carbon-containing waste at the point of collection will typically be negative. Although in
practice landfill sequesters part of the carbon on a long-term basis, it is not desirable to
encourage landfill for other environmental reasons.
Any additional avoided greenhouse gas emissions from avoided methane production due
to diversion of material from landfill or other disposition are considered out of scope of the
main GHG calculation, but may be included in the calculation of “other GHG savings” (cf.
section 1.1.7).
When carbon-containing waste is diverted from either landfill or from incineration without
energy recovery and used as an input for novel fuel or consumable chemical production,
this will result in a project scenario with a negative emission term for the non-biogenic
carbon-containing waste as a rigid input in the “inputs” box and, a positive emission term
in the “combustion (principal products)” or “end of life (principal products)” boxes (see
section 2.2.7 and 2.2.9 respectively). If the number of carbon atoms in the non-biogenic
waste input is identical or close to the number of carbon atoms in the produced fuel, these
terms would exactly cancel each other out or be very similar. In such cases, the applicants
should still include both terms in the calculations for transparency and to aid the evaluators
in understanding the project.
Projects using exclusively biomass waste or residues to produce heat or electricity as a
product are typically classified as renewable energy projects (see section 1.2) and should
apply the RES methodology (section 3). Projects using a mixed biomass/fossil waste or
residual input to produce heat or electricity as a product should refer to the provisions of
section 1.2.5.2 on hybrid EII + RES projects. Projects involving a component of carbon
capture should refer to the examples in section 6.4.
In some projects, a material waste stream may be taken as an input and only partly utilised
(for example if a project involves utilisation of some subset of plastics in a municipal waste
stream with the remnant waste returned for other disposal). In such cases, the emission
in the input box should be based on the change in emissions for only the fraction of the
municipal waste actually utilised.
Transport emissions for waste inputs should be considered only if waste feedstocks are
transported for more than 500 km to reach the first point of processing/treatment (see
section 1.3.4).
Any biomass used in InnovFund projects, including biomass wastes or residues, must
conform to the relevant minimum requirements specified in the Call Text.
2.2.6.5 SEMI-ELASTIC inputs
Some inputs are one of several co-products produced in fixed ratios from an existing
process, but with less value than other co-products. In such cases, it may not be clear
whether the input should be characterised as rigid or elastic. To simplify the assessment
of these cases, any input that represents less than 10% of the economic value of products
from a process is considered rigid, any input that represents more than half of the economic
value of products from a process is considered elastic, and any input with a value from
10% to 50% of the economic value of products from a process is considered semi-
elastic. The emissions of a semi-elastic material shall be assessed as the weighted
combination of the emissions if it was entirely rigid and the emissions if it was entirely
elastic. This calculation is described fully in Appendix 2.
75EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
2.2.6.6 Timing operations to lower grid electricity emissions
A plant using electricity (such as an electrolyser) can reduce the emissions of the grid
electricity it consumes by operating only at times when the emissions of the electricity
supply are below average. This approach helps grid stability in a similar way to electricity
storage, and this can be considered by calculating a ‘virtual storage’ credit following the
provisions in this section.
Virtual storage can only be claimed in the case that a project is grid connected. No virtual
storage term shall be included if a project is directly connected to a renewable power facility
without grid connection. The credit allowed for virtual storage in energy intensive industries
recognises that while the long-term trajectory (2050) is for full grid decarbonisation, in the
short-term the EU electricity grid still includes fossil power generation, and that additional
climate benefit can be delivered if an electricity-consuming project times its operation to
preferentially consume power when the GHG intensity of grid electricity is below average.
To claim a virtual storage credit the applicant must provide details of the plan to manage
grid electricity consumption to coincide with times when the emissions of the electricity
supply are below average. For example, if an applicant claims that a PPA is used to
determine when electricity is consumed they must provide convincing evidence that using
this PPA is a reasonable basis to ensure that electricity consumption is preferentially
reduced during periods of high grid carbon intensity. If a credible plan to time operation is
not provided, this may affect the assessment of the quality of the GHG calculations.
Credit may only be claimed for periods of lower electricity consumption where the reduction
in consumption results from a decision by the applicant based on data about the supply of
high GHG emissions electricity to the grid. This could include the instantaneous fraction of
renewable power from intermittent sources supplied to the grid, the instantaneous price of
grid electricity as a proxy for the level of renewable power supply, or other similar metrics.
Credit may not be claimed based on the expectation of reduced electricity consumption
during periods of necessary maintenance, emergency shutdowns or shutdowns due to a
lack of market demand for either principal or non-principal products, unless it can be
demonstrated that such shutdowns can be purposefully timed to coincide with periods of
higher-than-average grid electricity GHG emissions intensity.
The virtual storage credit shall be calculated by resolving the time-dependent electricity
demand into a virtual storage component plus a constant average consumption. This is
illustrated in the example diagram below (Figure 2.2) for a case where the plant consumes
zero power in its reduced operation mode. A timed operation credit may also be calculated
for a plant that reduces power consumption in its reduced operation mode, but not all the
way to zero.
The emission avoidance of the virtual storage component of the project shall be calculated
as indicated in the section on energy storage (see section 4). This additional avoidance
should be included as a credit term (negative emission) in the processes box equal to the
absolute emissions avoidance calculated for the virtual storage component. The applicant
must include details of the virtual storage calculation in their application. The relevant
emission factors for electricity in EII projects timing their operation are indicated in section
1.4.3.1 (Table 1.3).
Some projects using timed operation may show negative project emissions. because
of the associated emission credit. However, such projects should not be understood as
delivering net carbon removals. Refer to section 1.1.5 for the calculation of adjusted project
emissions and adjusted relative GHG emission avoidance for the purpose of claiming net
carbon removals.

2.2.7 Emissions from combustion (principal products)
Some projects will produce one or more principal products that will be combusted for
energy purposes. This includes projects producing novel transport fuels, fuel additives,
solid fuels and natural gas substitutes as principal products. In such cases the emissions
from combustion of these principal products shall be included in the “combustion (principal
products)” box. This must include the emissions of CO , CH and N O, expressed in tonnes
2 4 2
of carbon dioxide equivalent.
In the case of transport fuels, this will normally be done through the use of InnovFund
fossil fuel comparators (Table 2.2) in the reference scenario and by including the
combustion emissions for the novel fuel in the “combustion (principal products)” box of the
project scenario.
Example: A project produces a drop-in diesel fuel substitute. The reference scenario
will include emissions in the “combustion (principal products)” box based on the
InnovFund fossil fuel comparator for diesel. The project scenario will include in the
“combustion (principal products)” box combustion emissions for the novel fuel.
Where an InnovFund fossil fuel comparator is not available, then the combustion emissions
for the reference product should be included in the “combustion (principal products)” box
of the reference scenario, using combustion emission factors from the data hierarchy in
Appendix 1.
In the case of fuels produced using captured or recycled carbon, the combustion emissions
must still be included in the “combustion (principal products)” box of the project scenario.
Any emissions savings associated with the use of captured or recycled carbon are
characterised in the carbon capture credit (see section 6) for captured carbon, or in the
“inputs” box for recycled carbon.
77EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
2.2.7.1 Combustion emissions of carbon of biogenic origin
Note that, while CO emissions from the combustion of biomass-derived fuels and materials
2
may be treated as zero, non-CO emissions such as N O and CH emissions stemming from
2 2 4
the combustion of biomass-derived fuels and materials must be considered.
Attention: An emission factor of zero does not apply to the carbon incorporated into a fuel
through the utilisation of CO originally captured from a biogenic source. All the carbon
2
incorporated into a CCU product or fuel shall be treated as fossil carbon for the purpose of
calculating combustion emissions.
2.2.8 Emissions from change in use(principal products)
The methodology does not require applicants to include all emissions associated with the
use of principal products. However, in some cases the characteristics of innovative
products may save emissions in the use phase of the principal product, for instance
by allowing more efficient operation. The “change to in-use” emissions box allows credit to
be given in the project scenario for such emissions savings. Wherever such savings are
claimed they must be well justified and based on a realistic use case.
Example: A project produces an innovative nitrogen compound to use as a fertiliser,
and the applicant provides convincing evidence that its use will reduce nitrous oxide
(N O) emissions compared to conventional nitrogen fertilisers when applied to the
2
soil. Credit may be given in the “change to in-use (principal products)” box for the
CO equivalent emissions that can be avoided by use of the new compound.
2
Applicants will need to demonstrate the delivery of the reported emission reductions.
Therefore, they shall propose appropriate monitoring arrangements.
Applicant may include in-use savings from the changed properties of the various
materials to be produced with the principal product.
Example: A project produces a new material that enables improved tire dynamics
(e.g., light-weighting benefit and reduced rolling resistance) when the tires are
in-use. Credit may be given in the “change to in-use (principal products)” box for
the associated reduction in fuel use through the life of a tire.
Savings from changes to in-use emissions may only be claimed where they are enabled
directly by the properties of the produced product: it is not enough to state that the
produced product may be used as an input for the production of a second product which
would then deliver in-use emissions reductions.
Example: A project produces steel with an innovative process, but the steel itself
has comparable properties to steel from conventional processes. The applicant
states that the steel will be sold to another company and used in a manufacturing
process that has a lower carbon intensity than the state of the practice. The use of
the steel in the manufacturing process is not enabled by any particular property of
the produced steel, and therefore no additional credit may be given.
In some cases, the use of an innovative product will enable in-use emissions savings only
when coupled with one or more additional innovative products of practices. In such cases,
the applicant should record in the “change to in-use” emissions box a fraction of the
emissions saved proportional to the ratio of the cost of the innovative product to the cost
of the entire innovative system.
Example: A project produces an innovative polymer that can be combined with a
second innovative polymer (not produced by the project) and used to produce
lightweight packaging material, allowing reductions in fuel consumption by delivery
vehicles. If the costs of the two polymer components are equal, then the applicant
78EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
may record a credit in the “change to in-use” emissions box equivalent to half of
the expected emissions saving due to reduced fuel use by delivery vehicles.
Unlike the other boxes, the in-use emissions in the project scenario focus on changes in
emissions rather than including all use-phase emissions. There is therefore no need to
record in-use emissions in the reference scenario. This leaves the “change to in-use
(principal products)” emissions box for project scenario only.
The emission avoidance in use is first estimated per tonne of product. Then the scale of
production assumed in the calculation of total emission avoidance is limited to the quantity
that the applicant is confident to be able to sell into the market within which in-use savings
are achievable. During the monitoring and reporting stage, applicants will be required to
prove the amount of products sold into that market in addition to monitoring and reporting
of the parameters related to the production of the product.
Some emission reductions associated with use of the principal products are dealt with
outside of the “change to in-use (principal products)” emissions box. If the use of a novel
product replaces a larger quantity of a conventional product (for example 1 tonne of a
novel product replaces 1.2 tonnes of a conventional product) this is dealt with by including
1.2 tonnes of conventional production in the reference scenario for every 1 tonne of novel
production in the project scenario.
Attention: If a principal product replaces fossil fuels, then the difference in combustion
emissions are dealt with via the “combustion (principal products)” box, and not in the
“change to in-use” emissions box.
2.2.9 Emissions from end of life (principal products)
End of life emissions refer to the emissions associated with the disposal or recycling of a
principal product after the end of its useful life. Applicants are not permitted to include end
of life emissions for non-principal products, except in the case described in section 2.2.10.
Innovation Fund applications are not required to provide full end of life emissions
estimates, but shall include end of life emissions for principal products in two cases:
1. If a principal product (either the innovative product from the project scenario or the
conventional product performing the equivalent function in the reference scenario)
contains carbon, then the applicant must include any emissions associated with the
fate of that carbon in the “end of life (principal products)” box. These emissions must
be included even if they are identical between the project and reference scenarios.
Attention: Failure to consider the fate of carbon at end of life would result in distortion of
the emissions avoidance calculation and may affect the quality of the GHG calculation.
2. If a principal product produced by the project scenario will deliver emission
reductions in its end of life compared to the equivalent conventional product in the
reference scenario, then the calculated reduction in end of life emissions may be
included as a credit (negative emission term) in the “end of life (principal products)”
box of the project scenario.
These two cases are further explained below.
2.2.9.1 Principal product containing carbon
Where carbon is incorporated into principal products and is not released during product
use or through combustion of those products as fuels, the applicant must consider the
expected fate of this carbon at the end of life. This fate may differ between project and
reference scenarios, but any assumed differences shall be well justified.
79EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
2.2.9.1.1 Natural decomposition, incineration, landfilling
In cases where the likely fate would be any combination of natural decomposition,
incineration (with or without energy recovery) or landfilling, then an emission term shall
be included in the “end of life (principal products)” box based on CO e emissions from
2
stoichiometric combustion of all the carbon contained in the principal products (i.e.
complete oxidation to CO of all carbon atoms).
2
Example: methanol is produced as a principal product.
If the methanol is used as a transport fuel and the reference scenario is based on
a fossil fuel comparator (sections 2.2.4.4 and 2.2.4.6), then no additional emissions
need to be included in the “end of life (principal products)” box. Instead, combustion
emissions need to be included in the “Emissions from combustion (principal
products)” box (see section 2.2.7).
If instead the methanol is used as a chemical product and is expected to decompose,
be landfilled or be incinerated after use the applicant shall include stoichiometric
combustion emissions for the produced quantity of methanol in the “end of life
(principal products)” box for both the project and reference scenarios.
If some fraction of the carbon in the principal products is of biogenic origin, then the
stoichiometric combustion emissions for that fraction of the product may be treated as
having zero associated CO emissions (section 1.1.7). An emission factor of zero does not
2
apply to the carbon incorporated into a product through the utilisation of CO originally
2
captured from a biogenic source. All the carbon incorporated into a CCU product shall be
treated as fossil carbon for the purpose of calculating end of life emissions.
2.2.9.1.2 Recycling
If the likely fate (i.e. expected for at least 90% of material produced) of the carbon in the
product materials would be recycling into new products, which must be credibly justified
by the applicant, then this term in the “end of life (principal products)” box shall be set to
zero (this should still be explicitly recorded in the GHG calculation). If the likely fate is a
combination of some recycling (less than 90% of the material produced) and other fates,
then an emission factor of zero should be used only for the fraction of carbon that is
recycled.
If an applicant claims that the product of the project scenario will be recycled but the
conventional product in the reference scenario would not be recycled, then this assumption
must be well justified by reference to the physical characteristics of the products (for
instance replacing a plastic that is not normally recycled with one that is), or to actions
within the power of the applicant (e.g., if the business model included collection of used
items for recycling). Applicants shall not take credit for assumed increases in recycling
rates that are not directly related to the project. Recycling rates assumed for principal
products in either scenario must be credibly justified. For example, an applicant would not
be permitted to assume 100% recycling of a material that was recyclable in principle if it
is not normally recycled in practice.
There is no additional credit permitted in the GHG emission calculation of the Innovation
Fund for avoiding primary material use by enabling recycling.
Example: A project produces recyclable plastic bottles as a principal product, and
they will replace conventional plastic bottles that are not recyclable. The applicant
provides evidence that the typical disposition of non-recyclable bottles in their
region is to be sent to landfill, but that 70% of recyclable bottles are sent for
recycling.
80EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Landfilled material may be treated as if it would be combusted without energy
recovery, therefore the applicant includes emissions term in the “end of life
(principal product)” box of the reference scenario based on stoichiometric
combustion emissions for 100% of the conventional bottles, and an emission term
in the “end of life (principal product)” box of the project scenario based on
stoichiometric combustion emissions for only 30% of the innovative bottles (the
30% that it is assumed are not sent for recycling).
2.2.9.1.3 Carbon incorporation into products on a long-term basis
In cases where the applicant can show that most of the carbon in the principal product(s)
will remain incorporated in the material on a long-term basis, defined as a useful lifetime
of 50 years or more before the product is disposed, then the applicant may include in the
42F
“end of life (principal products)” box only 50% of the CO emissions from
2
stoichiometric combustion of that product. This may be appropriate in the case of
building materials, for example.
It is the responsibility of the applicant to convincingly demonstrate that it is reasonable to
assume that the carbon will normally remain incorporated for at least 50 years. The
applicant must be consistent in the consideration of long-term carbon utilisation in the
reference and project scenarios, and the applicant must treat carbon incorporated in the
principal products in the project and reference scenarios equally when considering the
potential for long-term incorporation.
In general, if physically similar products are produced in the two scenarios, then the
assumptions about long-term carbon utilisation should be identical. Applicants are not
permitted to treat more than 50% of the carbon as long-term incorporated.
Example: A project produces polystyrene beads from fossil resources as a principal
product, and the material will be used in building insulation. The product from the
project is chemically identical to conventionally produced polystyrene beads (the
reference product) but produced in a more efficient manner. The applicant shows
that the insulation can be expected to remain in place for at least 50 years. The
applicant therefore includes an emission term in the “end of life (principal products)”
box in both the project and reference scenarios equivalent to the emissions from
stoichiometric combustion of only 50% of the carbon from the material.
This does not affect the absolute emission saving from the project as the terms are
the same in both scenarios. The end of life emissions are lower in both scenarios
than they would be for a project producing polystyrene for short term use, so
because the reference scenario emission will be lower this will result in a higher
reportable relative GHG emission reduction than if the material were used in an
application where it was expected to go to landfill immediately after use.
2.2.9.1.4 End of life emissions of carbon of biogenic origin
Attention: When calculating end-of-life emissions carbon in a product that is from a CCU
process shall be treated as fossil carbon irrespectively of its origin. In other words,
where carbon in a principal product is derived from CO captured from a biogenic source,
2
this shall not be treated as biogenic carbon at end of life. The credit for the biogenic
characteristics of the captured carbon is already given in the “processes” box where
appropriate, and cannot be given a second time in the “end of life” box (see section 2.2.5.3
and section 6.3).
In other cases, when the carbon incorporated in the product or being recycled is of biogenic
origin (i.e. derived from biomass-derived inputs to the project), then the end-of-life
emission of this carbon is set to zero, and therefore the emissions are unaffected by the
likely fate of this carbon.
81EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Recognition may therefore be given to projects delivering recycling or long-term
incorporation of carbon of biogenic origin through the inclusion of a credit (negative
emission term) in the “end of life (principal products)” box for the extended useful life of
that biogenic carbon. This credit should be equivalent to 50% of the stoichiometric
combustion emissions for the amount of biogenic carbon that will remain incorporated.
Example: A project produces biochar as a principal product which is to be used as
a soil improver. The applicant provides convincing evidence that the application of
biochar to the soil can improve nitrogen retention and thereby reduce nitrogen
fertiliser use, and therefore the reference product is set as nitrogen fertiliser, in the
sector chemicals, on an equivalent function basis. The quantity of nitrogen fertiliser
in the reference is calculated as the reduction in nitrogen fertiliser consumption to
be delivered over the first 10 years of operation of the project. The applicant
provides references to support the claim that the biochar will remain incorporated
in the soil for a period of more than 50 years. This would normally allow the
applicant to discount the end-of-life emissions from carbon release by 50%, but
because biochar is a biogenic product the end of life emissions are zero whether or
not the biochar remains in the soil. The applicant therefore includes a credit in the
“end of life (principal products)” box equivalent to the stoichiometric combustion
emissions for 50% of the carbon in the biochar.
Example: A project produces bio-PET bottles to replace conventional fossil PET
bottles. Both types of bottle are recyclable and the applicant shows that the
recycling rate in the relevant region is over 90%. A zero-emission term is included
in the “end of life (principal product)” box of the reference scenario, while an
emission credit (negative emission term) is included in the “end of life (principal
product)” box of the project scenario equivalent to 50% of the stoichiometric
combustion emissions for the carbon in the PET.
2.2.9.2 Other reductions in end of life emissions
If a project delivers further reductions in “end of life” emissions compared to the
reference scenario, these may also be included in the calculation. This could be relevant
in cases where a principal product replaces a chemically different conventional product and
can be disposed of in a more energy efficient way, or if an innovative product avoids
end-of-life emissions or non-CO greenhouse gases (expressed as CO e).
2 2
Example: Innovative refrigerants could replace conventional refrigerants with
higher global warming potential. This could avoid emissions associated with
potential leakage of the conventional refrigerants at “end of life” (some leakage
could occur during proper disposal of refrigerators, and some fraction of
refrigerators may not be properly disposed of).
Furthermore, some projects may enable more efficient recycling due to changes in the
physical characteristics of products. In such cases, changes in “end of life” emissions
should be estimated and added to the emissions avoidance calculations. Any such credits
should be clearly justified, and in general such credits will only be considered where they
relate to fundamental physical properties of the materials at “end of life” (such as a
different global warming potential for refrigerant gases) and not where reductions at “end
of life” are conditional on behaviour changes outside of the control of the applicant (such
as changed recycling practices that are predicated on very specific waste sorting protocols
that may not be adopted).
2.2.10 Emissions from non-principal products
A project may produce a number of products. At least one must be a principal product, and
any other products produced must be identified as either co-principal or non-principal
products, following the provisions in section 1.2.
82EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
The processes in both the project and reference scenarios shall produce the same quantity
of the principal products (“processes” box), or, where the principal product and reference
product, are physically different shall produce the quantities required to deliver an
equivalent function. However, there may be changes in non-principal product(s) (i.e., co-
products of the principal products that are supplied for use outside the project boundary)
associated with the adoption of innovative processes. To balance the scenarios, the
emissions associated to non-principal products must be considered, but only in the
scenario in which they are produced.
The emission avoidance of the project will generally be increased by the production of non-
principal products in the project scenario, while it will generally be reduced by the
production of non/principal products in the reference scenario.
A credit (negative emission term) proportional to the quantity of each non-principal product
produced should be included in the “non-principal products” box. Similarly, if non-principal
products are produced in the reference scenario, a credit (negative emissions term)
should be included in the “non-principal products” box of the reference scenario. This
means that, for both the reference and project scenarios, the term in the “non-
principal products” box shall be calculated as:
𝐶 =−1∗𝑄 ∗𝐸𝐹
𝑁𝑃𝑃 𝑅𝑃 𝑅𝑃
Where:
𝐶 = Credit for non-principal product.
𝑁𝑃𝑃
𝑄 = Quantity of conventional replaced product substituted by the non-principal product.
𝑅𝑃
𝐸𝐹 = Emission factor of the conventional replaced product, produced in a conventional
𝑅𝑃
way.
The credit should be based on an emission factor for a ‘conventional replaced product’ that
could be replaced in the market by the non-principal product. In many cases, the
appropriate conventional replaced product will be a physically identical product produced
in a conventional way. In some cases, however, the appropriate conventional replaced
product will be a physically different product that serves a similar function. The choice of
a conventional replaced product is discussed further below.
The emissions factors needed for this calculation are to be taken from the data hierarchy
in Appendix 1 following the method in the section on other relevant inputs (section
2.2.6.3.3), with the exception of natural gas as a conventional replaced product for which
specific rules are stated in section 2.2.10.2 below. Allocation approaches should not
be used to deal with the emissions associated to non-principal products.
2.2.10.1 Accounting for carbon in non-principal products
Attention: Carbon in a non-principal product that is from a CCU process shall be treated
as fossil carbon irrespectively of its origin. In other words, where carbon in a principal
product is derived from CO captured from a biogenic source, this shall not be treated as
2
biogenic carbon at end of life. The credit for the biogenic characteristics of the captured
carbon is already given in the “processes” box where appropriate, and cannot be given a
second time (see section 2.2.5.3 and section 6.3).
It is important when accounting for non-principal products to ensure that any carbon
embedded in the product and/or its conventional alternative is properly accounted for. This
affects the way in which the emission factor for the conventional replaced product shall be
chosen. There are two cases:
83EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
1. The non-principal product is physically the same as the conventional product it
replaces, and all of the carbon in the non-principal product is non-biogenic. In this
case, the emission factor shall exclude the carbon contained in the
conventional replaced product. The carbon released through
combustion/use/end of life of the non-principal product is the same as would be
released through combustion/use/end of life of the conventional replaced product.
Example: methanol is produced as a non-principal product using captured carbon,
which is not biogenic, and will be supplied for use as a chemical. The conventional
replaced product is conventionally produced methanol, which is physically similar.
The document “Definition of input data to assess GHG default emissions from
biofuels in EU legislation” from the data hierarchy states that the emissions
associated with methanol use are 28.2 gCO e/MJ for methanol supply and 68.9
2
gCO e/MJ for methanol combustion. The combustion emissions shall not be
2
included, so the correct emission factor for the conventional replaced product is
28.2 gCO e/MJ.
2
2. The non-principal product is physically different with respect to the conventional
product it replaces, and/or some of the carbon in the non-principal product is
biogenic. In this case, the carbon released through combustion/use/end of life of
the non-principal product may not be the same as would be released through
combustion/use/end of life of the conventional replaced product, and therefore any
difference must be calculated. The emission factor for the conventional replaced
product shall be calculated as its supply emissions plus its carbon content
(converted to CO on a stoichiometric basis, equivalent to the combustion emissions
2
for that material), minus the non-biogenic carbon content of the non-principal
product.
Example 1: methanol is produced as a non-principal product using biogenic carbon.
The conventional replaced product is conventionally produced methanol, which is
physically similar. The document “Definition of input data to assess GHG default
emissions from biofuels in EU legislation” from the data hierarchy states that the
emissions associated with methanol use are 28.2 gCO e/MJ for methanol supply
2
and 68.9 gCO e/MJ for methanol combustion. The combustion emissions shall be
2
included. There is no non-biogenic carbon in the non-principal product methanol,
so no further term needs to be subtracted. The correct emission factor for the
conventional replaced product is calculated as the supply emissions plus the
combustion emissions, which gives 97.1 gCO e/MJ.
2
Example 2: methanol is produced as a non-principal product using carbon from
waste gasification that is 40% biogenic, and it will be supplied for use as a chemical.
The conventional replaced product is conventionally produced methanol, which is
physically similar. The document “Definition of input data to assess GHG default
emissions from biofuels in EU legislation” from the data hierarchy states that the
emissions associated with methanol use are 28.2 gCO e/MJ for methanol supply
2
and 68.9 gCO e/MJ for methanol combustion. The combustion emissions shall be
2
included. The non-principal product methanol has 60% fossil carbon content carbon
in the non-principal product methanol so a term equal to 60% of methanol
combustion emissions must be subtracted (41.3 gCO e/MJ). The correct emission
2
factor for the conventional replaced product is calculated as the supply emissions
plus the combustion emissions for the conventional replaced product, minus the
non-biogenic combustion emissions for the non-principal product methanol. This
gives: (28.2 + 68.9 – 41.3) = 55.8 gCO e/MJ
2
2.2.10.2 Correctly identifying the conventional product replaced by a non--principal
product
In some cases, it may not be obvious what the appropriate conventional replaced product
is and therefore what emission factor from the data hierarchy should be used to calculate
84EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
the credit for a non-principal product. This is especially likely in cases: where a non-
principal product is itself innovative so that there is no data in the data hierarchy to
characterise ‘conventional’ production of that material; where a non-principal product could
equally replace one of a number of conventional products; or where the non-principal
product is to be used in an innovative way.
The following principles shall be followed in choosing appropriate emission factors for non-
principal products in the data hierarchy, and the choices made must be well justified:
• Where several possible conventional products could be considered functionally
interchangeable with a non-principal product, the applicant shall use the lower of
the associated emission factors. The applicant must not inflate the emission credit
from non-principal products by cherry picking an alternative product with very high
associated emissions.
• If a non-principal product is expected to be combusted for energy, then in general
the conventional replacement product shall be taken to be natural gas, even if the
non-principal product is more physically similar to other fossil fuels. In this case,
the upstream supply emission for natural gas shall be treated as zero and the
stoichiometric combustion emissions as 56.2 gCO e/MJ for consistency with the
2
natural gas comparator value in section 2.2.4.5. An exception may be made to this
principle if the applicant can demonstrate that a non-principal product is likely to
be used to substitute a known fuel other than natural gas in a specific application
in which a higher-carbon-content fuel is required for physical reasons, for example
replacing fossil coke used in steel manufacture.
Example: if biochar35 is produced as a non-principal product and expected to be
43F
used as a fuel, then the credit in the “non-principal products” box shall generally be
calculated taking natural gas as the conventional replacement product rather than
a solid fuel such as coal. The emission factor for the replacement product is
calculated as the supply emissions (taken to be 0 gCO e/MJ) plus the combustion
2
emissions (56.2 gCO e/MJ) minus the non-biogenic carbon content of the biochar
2
(0 gCO e/MJ), which gives 56.2 gCO e/MJ.
2 2
If a non-principal product containing biogenic carbon will not be combusted and will not
replace the function of a conventional product but is expected to provide useful
incorporation of its constituent carbon on a long-term basis (50 years or more expected
lifetime, other than in landfill), then, the applicant may calculate a negative emission terms
for medium term carbon incorporation calculated as 50% of the biogenic carbon content.
Attention: Carbon in a non-principal product that is from a CCU process shall be treated
as fossil carbon irrespectively of its origin. In other word, where carbon in a principal
product is derived from CO captured from a biogenic source, this shall not be treated as
2
biogenic carbon at end of life.
Example: if biochar is produced as a non-principal product and will be sold as a soil
improver with the primary purpose of storing its constituent carbon in the soil (i.e.
not directly replacing the use of conventional products such as compost or
fertilisers). The applicant is able to provide evidence that the expected carbon
incorporation time is 50 years or more. A credit (negative emission term) may be
included in the “non-principal products” box equivalent to 50% of the CO emissions
2
from stoichiometric combustion of the biochar.
If the non-principal product will not be combusted and will be used for an innovative
function that will enable more efficient use of other materials, thenthe applicant may

85EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
propose (with a well-founded justification) a calculation of the avoided emissions and
include these additional avoided emissions as a credit (negative emission term) in the
“non-principal product box”. In such cases, the applicant should avoid overstating the
potential benefits. Failure to provide a convincing justification for the calculation of this
credit may affect the quality of the GHG calculation.
Example: A non-principal product from a biorefining process is to be used as a cattle
feed additive, and the applicant is able to provide evidence that this will reduce the
formation of methane through enteric fermentation. A credit may be calculated
based on the amount of methane emissions to be avoided by use of the feed
additive.
2.3 Data and parameters
Each project will identify the parameters that will remain constant throughout the duration
of the project and consequently shall not be monitored by choosing the sources of data as
explained in section 2. These will include all emission factors, combustion emissions, and
lower heating values (net calorific values).
86EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
3 Renewable energy (RES)
3.1 Scope
This section describes the calculation of GHG emission avoidance for projects covered
under the renewable energy (RES) category. These projects produce electricity, heat
and/or cooling from renewable energy sources, or use renewable energy in activities that
are not covered by Annex I of the ETS directive. This section also covers the manufacturing
of components to be used in renewable energy facilities or consumer products, including
stationary fuel cells.
Electricity produced from renewable sources may be dispatchable or non-dispatchable,
depending on the nature of the source, and may be supplied to a grid or directly to an end
user. Renewable energy sources include wind energy, solar energy, hydro/ocean energy,
geothermal energy (including ambient energy through heat pumps), and bioenergy.
Renewable energy projects that include a CCS or CCU component, shall calculate the CC
credit based on the guidance described in section 6.
Projects that include both the production and storage of renewable energy shall apply as
hybrid projects following the provisions in section 1.2.5.4, and correctly applying the
relevant emission factors for the RES and ES component of the project as specified in
section 1.4.3.
This section also covers projects aiming at the retrofitting, repowering, rehabilitation,
refurbishment, replacement, or capacity addition of an existing renewable energy plant.
For these projects, only the added capacity, or the capacity affected by the retrofitting,
shall be accounted for in the GHG calculations (See section 3.2.1).
3.1.1 Products and sectors
Products and sectors covered under the RES category are defined in section 1.2, with
additional guidance provided in sections 3.1.2, 3.1.3, and 3.1.4 below.
3.1.2 Bioenergy projects
Bioenergy can be generated from biomass-derived fuels as defined in section 1.4.4. Any
project using biomass-derived fuels must comply with the relevant sustainability

No emissions associated to other uses of biomass-derived fuels, nor leakage or venting or
other chemical or biological process, shall be included.
Projects aiming exclusively at producing biomass-derived fuels and materials shall follow
the rules for Energy Intensive Industry (EII) projects in section 2. If the project includes
both the production of biomass-derived fuels and their consumption for the purpose of
generating electricity, heat, or cooling as a principal product, then the project shall be
treated as a hybrid EII + RES project and follow the provisions in section 1.2.5.2.
Similarly, projects producing heat or electricity as a product from feedstocks that are partly
biogenic (for example mixed municipal waste with both biogenic-carbon and fossil-carbon
content), shall refer to the provisions of section 1.2.5.2 on hybrid EII + RES projects. When
87EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
such projects also involve a component of carbon capture, applicants should also refer to
the examples in section 6.4.
3.1.2.1 Projects operating stationary fuel cells
Projects aiming at operating stationary fuel cells using biomass-derived fuels and having
electricity, heating, or cooling as their principal product should apply under sector
RES/bioenergy and refer to the provisions in section 3.1.2.
Projects aiming at operating stationary hydrogen fuel cells and having electricity, heating,
or cooling as their principal product should also apply under sector ‘bioenergy’, and use
the emission factors for hydrogen for renewable energy generation projects as specified in
section 1.4.3.2. Emissions associated to the supply (Proj ) or use (Proj ) of

hydrogen shall be disregarded.
Projects aiming at operating stationary fuel cells using RFNBOs other than hydrogen, and
having electricity, heating, or cooling as their principal product should also apply under
sector ‘bioenergy’ and follow the provisions in this sub-section. Emissions associated to the
supply (Proj ) or use (Proj ) of the RFNBO shall be disregarded.
bio supply bio use
For such projects, renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) are considered as
defined in the Renewable Energy Directive 2018/2001 (RED) and its Delegated
Regulations, and meeting the greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria set in Article 29a
of RED.
The applicant must credibly justify the assumptions made with respect to the renewable
origin of the fuel. Failure to provide adequate justification may affect the quality of the
GHG calculations and the resulting evaluation. In addition, the applicants must propose
adequate monitoring measures in their monitoring plan (see section 1.5 and Appendix 4)
to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting of the assumptions made at the application
stage. Failure to provide an adequate monitoring plan may negatively affect the quality of
the GHG calculations, and the resulting evaluation.
During project implementation, failure to demonstrate the actual renewable nature of the
fuel(s) used during project implementation may affect the overall GHG emission avoidance
that can be achieved by the project, which may have consequence in terms of grant
disbursement as specified in the Call Text (see also section 1.1.9).
Projects aiming at operating fuel cells using non-renewable fuels shall follow the provisions
for Energy Intensive Projects (EII, section 2). Projects aiming at operating fuel cells using
a mix of renewable and non-renewable fuels, shall refer to the provisions of section 1.2.5.2
on hybrid EII + RES projects. When such projects also involve a component of carbon
capture, applicants should also refer to the examples in section 6.4.
3.1.3 Manufacturing of components for renewable energy generation
Projects that aim at manufacturing components for renewable energy generation shall refer
to the provisions in section 1.3, in addition to those detailed in this section. The applicant
should refer to the relevant provisions in section 3.2 for the definition of the system
boundary, and section 3.3.3 for relevant equations.
3.1.3.1 Projects manufacturing stationary fuel cells
Projects aiming at manufacturing fuel cells for mobility applications, and their components,
shall refer to the provisions for mobility projects (MOB, section 5). Projects aiming at
manufacturing fuel cells for stationary applications, and their components, shall refer to
this sub-section, and the other relevant provisions in section 3.
Applicants must credibly justify the assumptions made with respect to the operation of the
facility or consumer product in which the component is installed based on credible
88EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
operational assumptions and technical specifications. The operational assumptions made,
must be representative of the expected use of the component, facility, and consumer
product. This includes the type of fuel used by a fuel cell.
The applicant shall not assume that the facility or consumer product equipped with a
component manufactured by the project will have better performance resulting in increased
GHG emission avoidance with respect to standard practice, unless this is a direct
consequence of the installation of the innovative component manufactured by the project.
For the case of fuel cells which can run on a variety of different fuel mixes, credible
assumptions shall be taken with respect to the expected fuel mix, and period over which
the fuel cell will operate on renewable fuels as opposed to fossil fuels. Only the operation
of the manufactured fuel cells on biomass-derived fuels, hydrogen and RFNBO can be
considered as part of the GHG calculations, and a hybrid application cannot be made for
the manufacturing of fuel cells operating on a mix of renewable and non-renewable fuels.
This means that the reference emissions shall be representative only of the portion of
energy displaced by the operation of the fuel cell on biomass-derived fuels, hydrogen, or
RFNBO.
Failure to provide adequate justification may affect the quality of the GHG calculations and
the resulting evaluation. In case the actual user of the innovative components produced
during project implementation differs from, or is not compatible with, the intended use
specified in the application, the project may not be able to reach the expected GHG
emission avoidance, with potential implications on grant disbursement (see also section
1.3.6).
3.1.4 Use of renewable energy in activities not covered under Annex I of the EU ETS
directive
Projects aiming to use renewable energy in activities not covered under Annex I of the EU
ETS directive must consume solely electricity, heating and/or cooling that are wholly
renewable. See relevant provisions in section 3.2 for the definition of the system boundary,
and section 3.3.2 for relevant equations for such projects.
The applicant must credibly justify the assumptions made with respect to the renewable
origin of the energy used by the project. Failure to provide adequate justification may
affect the quality of the GHG calculations and the resulting evaluation. In addition, the
applicants must propose adequate monitoring measures in their monitoring plan (see
section 1.5 and Appendix 4) to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting of the
assumptions made at the application stage. Failure to provide an adequate monitoring plan
may negatively affect the quality of the GHG calculations, and the resulting evaluation.
During project implementation, failure to demonstrate the actual renewable nature of the
energy used during project implementation may affect the overall GHG emission avoidance
that can be achieved by the project, which may have consequences in terms of grant
disbursement as specified in the Call Text (see also section 1.1.9).

In terms of emissions in the project scenario, sources of GHG emissions depend on the
technology and supporting infrastructure for the operation of the plant. Normally,
emissions from wind, solar and ocean energy generation are relatively limited. However,
the same may not be true for other renewables, such as geothermal or bioenergy.
Applicants shall quantify all GHG emissions associated to electricity, heat and fuel use in
stationary machinery and on-site vehicles for the operation of the renewable energy plant
in the project scenario (Proj ). This includes (but is not limited to) emissions of non-
on-site
CO greehouse gases from the combustion of biomass-derived fuels in the project scenario,

where the project involves retrofit or capacity added to an existing plant, only the added capacity shall be

3.2.1 Reference scenario for renewable energy projects
For the sake of simplification and to enable a fair competition between projects, the
reference scenario has been pre-defined for all projects, despite the regional differences
that may be observed in real life.
For RES projects, and in line with the provisions of section 1.4.3:
• The emission factor attributed to non-dispatchable electricity and to cooling in the
reference scenario is the typical EU grid emissions in 2030 according to the
Commission’s EU Reference Scenario 2020, i.e. EF = 48.8 tCO e/TJ (0.176
electricity,ref 2
tonnes CO e/MWh).
2
• The emission factor attributed to dispatchable electricity in the reference scenario
corresponds to the emissions from dispatchable power generation by a single cycle
gas turbine plant with 40% electrical efficiency, i.e. 140 tCO e/TJ (0.505 tonnes
2
CO e/MWh).
2
• The emission factor attributed to heat in the reference scenario is the EU ETS
benchmark for heat, i.e. 47.3 tCO e/TJ.
2
In the calculation of reference emissions, the following provisions shall apply:
• Projects aiming at generating renewable energy (section 3.3.1): In the
calculation of reference emissions, the applicant shall always consider the net
amount of energy that is delivered by the project for external usage (i.e., fed into
the grid or directly to another party). This means that the amount of energy
generated by the project and used for internal consumption cannot be included in
the reference scenario.
• Projects that use renewable electricity, heating and cooling in activities not
covered under Annex I of the EU ETS directive (section 3.3.2): In the
calculation of reference emissions, the applicant shall consider the amount of
energy that is displaced by the renewable energy used by the project.
• Manufacturing of components projects under the RES category (section
3.3.3): In the calculation of reference emissions, the applicant shall always
consider the net amount of renewable energy that is delivered by the facility or
consumer product, equipped with the component manufactured by the project, for
external usage (i.e., fed into the grid or directly to another party). This means that
the amount of energy generated by the facility or consumer product and used for
internal consumption cannot be included in the reference scenario.
For the situations where the project involves retrofit of an existing plant, the project shall
consider only the part of the plant that is affected by the retrofit. For example, in the case
of a retrofit at a wind farm that affects 10% of the wind turbines, only the energy generated
by those 10% of the wind turbines would be considered in the reference scenario and only
the emissions associated with operating those 10% of the wind turbines would be
considered in the project scenario.
For the situations where the project involves capacity added to an existing plant, only the
added capacity shall be accounted for. This means, for example, that in the case of the
91EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
addition of a carbon capture unit to a bioenergy facility without any increase of the energy
output of the facility, the reference emissions will be zero.
In some projects, an increase in the output of one product may be delivered at the expense
of a reduction in the output of another product. For example, a project introducing carbon
capture to a bioenergy facility may consume some of its produced electricity to run the
carbon capture unit, but increase heat output by a combination of increased biomass intake
and heat recovery from the carbon capture unit. In the case that the output of one type of
energy is reduced by a project but others increase then the reference emissions should
include a negative value for the term where there is ‘negative displacement’ by the project
activity. The sum of the emissions in the reference scenario may, however, never be less
than zero. For example, if a carbon capture unit consumed energy and thereby reduces
total energy output from a facility, the Ref term should be reported as zero, not as a
y
negative number.
3.3 Calculation of project and reference emission
The equation to be applied for the calculation of the emissions in the reference and project
scenario for renewable energy projects are described as follows:
• For projects that intend to produce renewable electricity, heating or cooling, refer
to section 3.3.1.
• For projects that intend to use renewable energy in activities not covered under
Annex I of the EU ETS directive, refer to section 3.3.2.
• For projects involving the manufacturing of renewable energy systems or their
components, refer to section 3.3.3.

projects, it is not possible to use equations 1.2 and 1.3. Therefore, the relative GHG
emission avoidance shall be set equal to 100% as specified in section 1.1.4, and the
adjusted relative GHG emission avoidance shall be set equal to 200% as specified in section
1.1.5.

4 Energy storage (ES)
The GHG emission avoidance of an energy storage (ES) project is calculated as the
difference between the project emissions and the emissions in the reference scenario (i.e.,
in the absence of the project) following the provisions in this section.
Emissions in the reference scenario correspond to the emissions associated to the energy
displaced by the output of the energy storage system, whereas project emissions are those
associated with the input to the energy storage system during operation, plus emissions
associated to the operation of the energy storage facility.
If the services delivered by the project are useful from a system perspective, additional
emissions avoidance associated with the delivery of the services may be claimed under
certain conditions. In this respect, the energy storage methodology distinguishes various
services that contribute to the GHG emission avoidance delivered by energy storage units,
as specified in section 4.1.
The energy stored may be sourced from an energy grid or directly from a plant, and it can
be delivered to an energy grid or directly to a plant. For electricity, heat, and hydrogen,
default emission factors depending on the source and intended use must be applied as
specified in section 1.4.3, and no deviations are allowed. Other standard emission factors
are provided in Table 4.2 and must be used, unless the applicant provides evidence and
credibly justify alternative assumptions made. Refer to section 1.1.9 for relevant provisions
concerning assumptions.
During operation, projects will be required to maintain records of measurements, quality
assurance and quality control procedures, and calculations used in the development of data
reported, along with copies of reported data and forms submitted. During the monitoring
period, beneficiaries will need to prove, based on the same methodology, that the GHG
emission avoidance is delivered. In addition, the project operators will be asked to deliver
hourly load profiles for knowledge sharing purposes. See also section 1.5 and Appendix 4
for relevant provisions.
4.1 Scope
This section applies to projects in the energy storage (ES) category (see section 1.2).
These projects can include the construction and operation of a greenfield energy storage
plant, or the extension of an existing plant by adding an energy storage unit.
An energy storage unit or plant can stores any type of energy (e.g. electricity, heat, cold,
hydrogen, gaseous or liquid fuels) from the time at which it was originally generated or
supplied, to a later moment of use. It is not allowed to claim emission avoidance for an
energy storage system during any period during which it is simultaneously charged and
discharged with the same type of energy (e.g. electricity).
The storage of energy may include the conversion of one energy type into another. In the
case of projects converting electricity into fuel, such as hydrogen or other synthetic fuels,
the application should generally be made under the Energy Intensive Industry (EII)
category and follow the provisions in section 2. Such projects may only apply under the ES
category and follow the provisions in this section if the storage of excess renewable energy
in another form is the primary aim of the project. For such projects, the electricity
consumed must be limited to periods of high renewable electricity production that result in
a particularly low load factor, condition that must be credibly justified by the applicant, and
demonstrated during project implementation.
This section is also to be used to calculate emissions savings from timed operation in EII
projects as detailed in section 2.2.6.6.
100EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
If a project includes an element of energy storage alongside EII activities, renewable
energy generation, or other activities falling under other categories, then the applicant
shall submit a hybrid application, following the provisions of section 1.2.5.
4.1.1 Services, products and sectors
Products and sectors covered under the ES category are defined in section 1.2 with some
examples provided below:
• Intra-day electricity storage, covering: arbitrage, reserve power, ramping,
auxiliary services to electricity grids (including reactive power, synchronous inertia),
and avoidance of renewable energy curtailment.
• Other energy storage, such as storage of hydrogen and storage of heat.
• Manufacture of components for energy storage, such as batteries and other
components for stationary energy storage applications.
Note for applicants familiar with earlier versions of the methodology: Components
for energy storage used in mobility applications, including road transport, are now covered
under the MOB category, section 5.
4.1.2 Constructing a reference for auxiliary services
The reference scenario for auxiliary services may be more complex to identify with respect
to other cases, because it may involve a change in the efficiency at which a service is
delivered, rather than a change in the quantity of the service delivered.
Applicants must propose an appropriate reference scenario for their project by taking into
account the specificities of the auxiliary service provided and the local context for providing
such service. This is explained in additional detail, and in relation to equations [4.4] and
[4.4a], in the example below.
Example: A project provides reactive power services with a rating of X MVAr. For
the reference, it is assumed that an equivalent reactive power service could be
delivered by running combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) below optimal efficiency
(e.g. running two turbines at 45% thermal efficiency instead of a single turbine at
55% thermal efficiency). The applicant identifies that Z MW of power generation
would need to run in this lower efficiency mode to provide the X MVAr of reactive
power, and that the reactive power service will be used by the grid for Y hours per
year. The additional natural gas consumption by CCGTs in the reference scenario,
expressed in TJ of natural gas, is equal to (55% - 45%)/(55% x 45%) x Z x Y x
0.0036, and the reference emissions in tonnes CO e would therefore be (55%-
2
45%)/(55% x 45%) x Z x Y x 0.0036 x EF (GHG emission factor for the
out, natural gas
combustion of natural gas in tCO2e/TJ, as defined in Table 4.2).
4.2 System boundary
The system boundary for an ES project includes the energy storage plant/unit and all
facilities that the energy storage plant/unit is connected to, and that are not metered
separately. In well justified cases, such as for the management of distributed renewable
energy, the condition for a single metering point may not be applicable.
The greenhouse gases and emission sources included in, or excluded from, the system
boundary are shown in Table 4.1.

5 Mobility (MOB)
This section covers projects under the mobility (MOB) category. These projects can
contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions (see section 1.1.6) from aviation, maritime,
and road transportation activities within the scope of the EU ETS, and to the reduction of
additional non-CO climate impacts from aviation and maritime activities within the scope
2
of the EU ETS (see section 1.1.8).
This section includes provisions on how to calculate the impacts that will be avoided in
operating journeys as a result of the implementation of innovative projects. The absolute
GHG emissions avoidance of the project is defined by the difference between the amount
of emissions from GHGs and other non-CO climate impacts, expressed in terms of CO
2 2
equivalent, that would occur for the delivery of the same transport services using a
conventional technology in the reference scenario, and those associated to the project
activity in the project scenario.
5.1 Scope
Projects under the MOB category include projects that aim to provide transportation
services, and projects that aim to manufacture innovative aircrafts, maritime vessels, road
vehicles and their components.
• Projects that aim to provide transportation services as their principal product
may envisage a reduction in energy use per functional unit, e.g. per km, per
journey), or a reduction in the emissions per unit of energy through, for example,
the adoption of a less carbon intensive energy source, e.g. use of electricity,
hydrogen, or biomass-derived fuels.
• For projects that aim to manufacture innovative aircrafts, maritime
vessels, road vehicles or their components, the project emissions shall be
defined by the emissions that the manufactured aircraft, vessel, or vehicle will emit
when in use, which shall be estimated based on credible assumptions about the
projected performance of all components of the finished vehicle, and underpinned
with robust evidence. Refer also to section 1.3 for general provisions for
manufacturing projects.
Examples of such projects include, but are not limited to:
▪ Projects that reduce energy use per functional unit (e.g. new vehicles/airframes,
reduced weight, replacement of fleet with more efficient vehicles/aircraft/vessels).
▪ Fuel switch (e.g. use of sustainable biofuels or blends, electricity, hydrogen or
recycled carbon fuels or renewable fuels of non-biological origin or alternative fuels
with lower content of other pollutants associated with climate forcing effects, e.g.
aromatics and sulphur, instead of the conventional fossil fuel).
• Projects that envisage a modal shift (e.g. new mode of transportation, or a
combination or various modes); Manufacturing of electric or hydrogen-fuelled
aircraft or their components.
▪ Manufacturing of innovative vessels and their components (e.g. new hull designs,
wind propulsion technologies, energy saving propulsors, power train hull appendage
and other hull technologies).
▪ Manufacturing of innovative vehicles and their components (e.g. electric vehicles,
fuel cell vehicles, batteries for mobility applications, fuel cells for mobility
applications).
111EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
▪ Solutions to reduce GHG emissions from on-board ship systems (e.g. fuel cells for
vessels, batteries for vessels).
▪ Wind propulsion technologies and power take-in from propulsors (e.g. Flettner
rotors, sail rigs, other wind propulsion devices).
▪ Projects involving the decarbonisation of the supporting infrastructure (e.g. at the
ports and airports).
▪ Projects that contribute to the reduction of non-CO climate impacts.
• Projects combining the above.
5.1.1 Choice of a sector for mobility projects
For projects classified under the MOB category, the sector shall be defined as specified in
section 1.2, i.e. it shall be determined based on the function of the principal product or
service that is the main aim of the project.
Example: A project that involves the manufacturing of innovative maritime vessels
shall be classified under sector MOB/maritime.
Example: A project that intends to provide transportation services for passengers
with an innovative aviation solution shall be classified under sector MOB/aviation.
The general rule above applies also to the case of modal switch projects:
Example: A project intends to replace road freight transport with maritime shipping.
The project aims to provide maritime transportation services; therefore, it shall be
classified under sector MOB/maritime.
Only in case a modal switch project aims to provide a transportation service in the project
scenario different than aviation, maritime, or road transport, then the sector shall be
chosen based on the transport service replaced in the reference scenario (which must be
either aviation, maritime, or road transport) following the provisions in section 1.2.1 and
the other relevant provisions in section 1.2
Example: A project intends to replace road freight with rail transport. The project
aims to reduce emissions in the road transport sector by replacing road travels with
transportation services in a sector different than road transport, maritime, or
aviation. Then, the sector is determined by the transport service replaced, and the
project shall be classified under sector MOB/road transport.
Projects aiming exclusively at producing fuels shall apply under the EII category (section
2). However, projects that envisage both the production and use of such fuels may apply
as hybrid EII + MOB projects, where the GHG emissions avoided are calculated separately
for each component and added up while removing any double counting. See section 1.2.5.5
for specific guidance.
5.1.2 Reference scenario for mobility projects
The reference scenario for mobility projects shall be the delivery of the same transport
services provided by the innovative project. This means that for a project delivering freight
and passenger transport services, the delivered transport service in terms of tonne-
kilometres and/or person-kilometres must be the same, respectively, while the number of
vehicle, vessels and/or aircrafts may (in some cases within the provisions of section
5.1.2.1) differ between the reference and the project scenario, if the typical size of the
innovative technology differs from the conventional one.
112EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
The emissions in the reference and project scenario shall be calculated following the
provisions and equations in section 5.3. The reference scenario shall be based on a
representative mode of transport as specified in section 5.1.2.1, and on the use of a
relevant conventional fossil fuel and relevant average vehicle fuel consumptions as
specified in section 5.1.2.2.
5.1.2.1 Mode of transport in the reference scenario
As a general rule, the mode of transport assumed in the reference scenario shall be the
same as in the project scenario. For a project aiming to deliver transport services, if section
5.3.1 allows for the selection of one out of multiple reference vehicles within the same
mode of transport, the applicant shall match the project scenario by selecting the one most
representative of the transportation service provided by the project.
This means that the reference scenario should typically be built by considering the same
number of vehicles as in the project scenario, travelling the same distances and
transporting the same volumes of passengers or goods as in the project scenario, and thus
providing the same transport service in terms of tonne-kilometres and/or person-
kilometres as in the project scenario.
Example: the reference scenario for a project delivering aviation transportation
services is an equivalent fleet of conventional aircrafts operating on the relevant
conventional fuel as specified in section 5.1.2.2. The number of reference aircrafts
should be the same as in the project scenario, and the type of reference aircraft
should be selected as the one most representative for the type of service provided
by the project among the options available, in terms of distance travelled and
volumes of passengers or goods transported. The transport service provided in the
reference scenario shall be the same as in the project scenario in terms of tonne-
kilometres and/or person-kilometres.
Two exceptions are allowed for specific projects that aim to provide a transport
service:
• When it is not possible to build a reference scenario for the delivery of the same
transportation service as in the project scenario (in tonne-kilometres and/or person-
kilometres) by considering the same number of vehicles in the two scenarios, then
the applicant may deviate from the standard approach in terms of number and type
of vehicles and distance travelled. However, the mode of transport considered must
be the same as in the project scenario.
• In situations in which the transport service provided by the project in the project
scenario is typically provided through other modes of transport in the reference
scenario, then the applicant can select the most common mode of transport used
for such services in the reference scenario, among those available within the
provisions in section 5.3.1. This is typically the case of projects that aim at reducing
emissions through modal shift, where nonetheless the reference scenario shall
provide the same transport service in terms of tonne-kilometres and/or person-
kilometres as in the project scenario.
These situations must be well justified by the applicants, for example by providing relevant
supporting documents. Deviating from the standard reference scenario without providing
a credible justification may negatively impact the credibility of the GHG calculations and
the resulting evaluation. In any case, the emissions in the reference and project scenario
shall be calculated following the provisions of section 5.3.1, and the transport service
provided in the reference scenario shall be equal to the transport service provided in the
project scenario in terms of tonne-kilometres and/or person-kilometres.
For projects aiming at manufacturing innovative aircraft, maritime vessels, or
road vehicles (section 5.3.2), deviating from the standard reference scenario is not
113EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
allowed. For such projects, the mode of transportation to be considered in the reference
scenario shall always match the one in the project scenario. For example, should the
project involve the manufacturing of a certain number of innovative maritime vessel, then
the applicant shall assume that these vessels will replace the same number of
representative conventional maritime vessel, thus providing the same transport service in
terms of tonne-kilometres and/or person-kilometres as in the project scenario.
5.1.2.2 Type of fuel and specific fuel consumption in the reference scenario
In terms of fuel types to be used in the reference scenario, the following shall apply:
• The conventional jet kerosene type A1 shall be used when the reference scenario is
based on aviation as a mode of transport;
• The maritime reference fuel oil, composed by a mix of sulphur fuel oil, marine diesel
oil (MDO)/marine gas oil (MGO) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) shall be used when
the reference scenario is based on maritime as a mode of transport.
• when the reference scenario is based on road transport
With regards to specific fuel consumption (i.e. fuel use per functional unit, SC )
ref,t,y
applicants shall adopt the default values or estimate those based on the provided
references as indicated in section 5.3.2.1, unless the average consumption of the reference
aircraft, maritime vessel or road vehicle is expected to differ significantly from such
standard values. In this case, applicants must provide appropriate references to justify all
assumptions adopted and include this parameter in the monitoring plan.
Deviations in the specific fuel consumption in the reference scenario, must be duly justified
and underpinned with robust evidence at the application stage. Failure to provide adequate
justification may negatively impact the credibility of the GHG calculations and the resulting
evaluation.
5.1.3 GHG emissions and additional non-CO climate impacts for mobility projects
2
The methodology for mobility projects considers the greenhouse gases (GHGs) covered by
section 1.1.6, including non-CO GHGs. In addition, the methodology for mobility projects
2
considers the additional non-CO climate impacts covered by section 1.1.8.
2
With respect to GHGs, the methodology for mobility projects accounts predominantly for
the CO , CH and N O emissions due to the combustion of fossil fuels, and for the CH and
2 4 2 4
N O emissions due to the combustion of biomass-derived fuels, renewable fuels of non-
2
biological origin (RFNBOs), and low-carbon fuels.
With respect to additional non-CO climate impacts, the methodology for mobility projects
2
considers the warming impact associated with black carbon emissions from maritime
transport and other non-CO climate impacts from aviation, such as emissions by aircraft
2
of water vapour, formation of contrails (condensation trails) and cloudiness in the wake of
aircraft, nitrogen oxides (NOx), soot particles, and oxidised sulphur species.
5.1.3.1 Renewable fuels and low-carbon fuels
The mobility methodology allows projects to consider a zero-emission factor for the CO
2
emitted when combusting or using biomass-derived fuels, renewable fuels of non-biological
origin (RFNBOs), and low-carbon fuels.
However, the emissions of non-CO greenhouse gases (e.g. CH and N O) associated to
2 4 2
the combustion of such fuels must be considered within the term Proj (or Proj ).
t,ene,y t,ene,unit,y
following the provisions in sections 5.3.1.2 and 5.3.2.2. Furthermore, leakeage of fuels

114EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
(or Proj ), following the provisions in section sections 5.3.1.2 and 5.3.2.2. No other
t,fug,unit,y
emissions associated to the use of these fuels should be included in the calculations.
Concerning the definition of biomass-derived fuels, RFNBOs, and low-carbon fuels:
• For projects intending to use biomass-derived fuels, refer to section 1.4.4, and in
particular to the sustainability requirements specified in section 1.4.4.1.
• RFNBOs are considered as defined in the Renewable Energy Directive 2018/2001
and its Delegated Regulations, and meeting the greenhouse gas emissions saving
criteria set in Article 29a of RED.
• Low-carbon fuels are considered as defined in Directive 2024/1788 on common
rules for the internal markets for renewable gas, natural gas and hydrogen.
For projects that aim to provide a transportation service (section 5.3.1), the
applicant must credibly justify the assumptions made with respect to the classification of
a fuel as biomass-derived fuel, RFNBO, or low-carbon fuel, for example by providing letter
of supports from potential suppliers or other supporting documents. If the origin of the fuel
is not known at the time of the application, and/or if its origin cannot be credibly justified,
then the fuel should be considered of fossil origin. Failure to provide adequate justification
may affect the quality of the GHG calculations and the resulting evaluation. In addition,
the applicants must propose adequate monitoring measures in their monitoring plan (see
section 1.5 and Appendix 4) to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting of the
assumptions made at the application stage. Failure to provide an adequate monitoring plan
may negatively affect the quality of the GHG calculations, and the resulting evaluation.
During project implementation, failure to demonstrate that the assumptions made at the
application stage are representative of the actual operation of the project, may affect the
overall GHG emission avoidance that can be achieved, which may have consequences in
terms of grant disbursement as specified in the Call Text (see also section 1.1.9).
For projects that aim at manufacturing innovative aircraft, maritime vessels, road
vehicles, or their components, the applicant must credibly justify the assumptions made
with respect to the fuel used by the aircraft, vessel, or vehicle based on credible operational
assumptions and technical specifications. The applicant shall not assume that the consumer
product equipped with a component manufactured by the project will have better
performance, consume less fuel, or consume a fuel different than the reference fuels mix,
unless this is a direct consequence of the installation of the innovative component
manufactured by the project. The operation assumptions made, must be representative of
the expected use of the component and consumer product. For example, for the case of
dual-fuel engines, credible assumptions should be taken with respect to the expected fuel
mix, and period over which the engine will operate on biomass-derived fuels, RFNBOs, and
low-carbon fuels as opposed to fossil fuels. Failure to provide adequate justification may
affect the quality of the GHG calculations and the resulting evaluation. In case the actual
user of the innovative components produced during project implementation differs from,
or is not compatible with, the intended use specified in the application, the project may
not be able to reach the expected GHG emission avoidance, with potential implications on
grant disbursement as specified in the Call Text (see also section 1.3.6).
The provisions in this sub-section are not relevant for the case of hydrogen used as a fuel
by a mobility project, for which an emission factor of zero applies, as specified inTable 1.4
section 1.4.3.2.
5.1.3.2 Additional non-CO climate impacts for aviation activities
2
For aviation, the approach for the calculation of non-CO climate impacts, detailed in
2
section 5.3, is aligned to an overall climate impact in the range from 2 to 4 times the
radiative forcing from CO alone, recognised by the IPCC in its special report on Aviation
2
and Global Atmosphere.
115EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
In the reference scenario, the additional non-CO climate impacts from aviation shall be
2
assumed equal to 2 times the CO emissions from jet A1 fuel combustion, corresponding
2
to an overall climate impact equal to 3 times the radiative forcing from CO alone.
2
Applicants may opt to decouple the calculation of additional non-CO climate impacts from
2
aviation from the single factor of fuel use if, and only if, they rely on data monitored
according to the Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework for additional
non-CO climate impacts from aviation under the EU ETS, should that be available at the
2
time of their application.
In the project scenario, applicants must calculate this term using a well-justified approach
based on scientific literature, or by modelling global near surface temperature change.
Alternatively, applicants can use data compliant with the MRV framework for additional
non-CO climate impacts from aviation under the EU ETS, should that be available at the
2
time of their application, and if the same approach is used also for the reference scenario.
Any claimed reduction of additional non-CO climate impacts from aviation activities must
2
be a direct consequence of the innovation proposed by the project. This means that
applicants are not allowed to claim a reduction in additional non-CO climate impacts that
2
only result from the adoption of a different calculation method between the reference and
the project scenario. Similarly, for the case of projects aiming at manufacturing aircrafts
and their components, the applicant shall not assume that the aircraft equipped with a
component manufactured by the project will have better performance in terms of additional
non-CO climate impacts with respect to the reference scenario, unless the use of the
2
component is part of the IF project and/or savings in terms of additional non-CO2 climate
impacts are a direct consequence of the installation of the innovative component
manufactured by the project.

5.3 Calculation of reference and project emissions
The equations to be applied for the calculation of the reference and project emissions of
projects that aim to provide a transport service as their principal product are
specified in section 5.3.1.
Projects aiming to build a plant for the manufacturing of innovative aircraft, vessels,
road vehicles or their components shall calculate their absolute GHG emission

Equations [5.1] and [5.2] define the parameters that shall be included in the calculation of
the Absolute GHG emissions avoidance for projects that aim to provide a transport service

Projects envisaging a combination of one or more modes of transport shall calculate the
emissions associated to each mode individually, before adding them up. In case the project
involves more than one type of aircraft, maritime vessel, or road vehicle within the same
transport mode, applicants shall calculate the emissions associated to each type of aircraft,
maritime vessel, and road vehicle individually, before adding them up.
The number and type of transport mode considered, and the number and type of aircrafts,
maritime vessels, and road vehicles considered, may be different in the project scenario
and in the reference scenario, when allowed by the provisions in section 5.1.2.1.

6 Credit for Carbon Capture and Storage or Utilisation
This section explains how a carbon capture credit (𝐶𝐶 ) can be calculated when a project
𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡
includes an element of carbon capture and storage or utilisation. Guidance on the selection
of the category and sector for CCU/S projects is provided in section 1.2.2.
In the case that following the rules below for the assessment of the GHG emissions credit
would result in double counting of any GHG emission (source or sink) already included in
the assessment of project scenario emissions following the rules for EII, RES, or MOB
projects, this double counting shall be removed.
In the unusual case that the reference scenario includes an element of carbon capture and
storage or utilisation(e.g. modification of an existing EII facility that captures or utilises
CO ), then a carbon capture term for the reference scenario shall be calculated following
2
the rules in this section, and an overall carbon capture credit shall be defined as the
difference between the carbon capture credit in the project scenario and the carbon credit
in the reference scenario.45
6.1 Scope
This section applies to projects that involve capturing CO from point sources or directly
2
from the ambient air for injection in storage sites permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC
on the geological storage of CO or for incorporation into products. This includes projects
2
that involve capturing CO , projects that involve transporting captured CO for storage or
2 2
use or utilisation, projects that involve storing captured CO , and projects that involve
2
utilising captured CO . A given project may include one or several of these steps.
2
A carbon capture credit cannot be claimed based on the capture of CO that is produced
2
as a by-product of hydrocarbon extraction (such as CO produced from natural gas wells).
2
A carbon capture credit cannot be claimed based on the capture of CO that is produced
2
intentionally for the purpose of capturing it (for example through extraction from a natural
CO reservoir or through additional combustion of fuels).
2
6.2 Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)
CCS is characterised by the capture of CO to be transported, injected and permanently
2
stored in a storage site permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC.
If the full CCS chain is not part of the application, the applicant should demonstrate the
provision of the remaining services in the CCS chain by third parties, for example by
providing letters of intent, draft contracts, or other relevant supporting documents. In
addition, since the InnovFund grant disbursement is dependent on verified emission
reductions, i.e. the amount of CO stored in a site permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC,
2
copies of contracts and other relevant documents will have to be provided during project
implementation to ensure the intended emissions savings are taking place.
6.3 Carbon Capture and utilisation (CCU)
An emission reduction by CCU can only be claimed by projects that will demonstrate
that the captured carbon will be used by incorporation into a product. Projects that
include a CCU component shall identify at least one of the CCU products as a principal
product under the EII category (see section 2.2.5.3). Projects that capture CO from a
2
source in a sector that falls under the RES category (e.g. a bioenergy plant) or the MOB
category (e.g. a ship) shall submit a hybrid application (see section 1.2.5), and cover the
production of the CCU product(s) in the EII part of the calculations.
A project can only claim an emission reduction because of CCU if the intended use
represents an additional utilisation of CO . No carbon capture credit can be claimed for
2
134EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
supplying captured CO to established markets, such as the production of carbonated
2
beverages, or greenhouse plant growth enhancement. No carbon capture credit may be
claimed for supplying CO to a third-party facility that is already operational and where the
2
CO supplied would replace an existing source of CO .
2 2
Even if the CO utilisation phase is not part of the application and is carried out by a third
2
party, the CO utilisation processes, inputs, and the combustion and/or end-of-life
2
emissions from the CCU product(s) must be included as part of the GHG calculations, in
line with section 2.2.5.3.1, 2.2.5.3.3, and other relevant provisions.
If the full CCU chain is not part of the application, the applicant should demonstrate the
provision of the remaining services in the CCU chain by third parties, for example by
providing letters of intent, draft contracts, or other relevant supporting documents. In
addition, since the InnovFund grant disbursement is dependent on verified emission
reductions, copies of contracts and other relevant documents will have to be provided
during project implementation to ensure the intended emissions savings are taking place.
6.4 CO capture from biogenic sources
2
There is no difference when calculating the CC credit between CO captured from fossil
2
sources and from biogenic sources. The CC credit is calculated based solely on the quantity
of CO permanently stored or used, and it is not affected by the origin of the CO . When
2 2
adding a CCS/CCU element to a project in the EII or RES categories that involves CO from
2
biogenic sources, any additional benefit to the project from the use of biogenic resources
is assessed under the EII or RES component of the calculations.
Example (fossil CO ): A carbon capture unit is added to an existing natural-gas-
2
fired power plant. The captured CO will be geologically stored. The carbon capture
2
credit shall be calculated following section 6.5 as the amount of CO stored, minus
2
any emissions associated with the capture, transport and storage of the CO . The
2
project shall apply with category/sector/product EII/Other/Dispatchable electricity.
Following the EII rules in section 2.2.5.2 an emission shall be recorded in the
processes box of the project scenario equal to the full amount of CO generated by
2
the power plant, even though some of it will be captured. This emission term will
be partly offset by the carbon capture credit term.
Example (biogenic CO ): A carbon capture unit is added to an existing biomass-
2
fired power plant. The captured CO will be geologically stored. The carbon capture
2
credit shall be calculated following section 6.5 as the amount of carbon stored,
minus any emissions associated with the capture, transport and storage of the CO .
2
The project shall apply with category/sector/product RES/Bioenergy/Dispatchable
electricity. As the output of the renewable energy plant is not expanded by the
project, and all the innovation relates to the carbon capture unit, the applicant
cannot claim reductions due to the renewable energy generation. As such, the terms
Ref
elec,prod, y
and Ref
heat,prod,y
shall be set to zero in Equation [4.1] when calculating the
reference emissions for the project.
Example (mixed CO stream): A carbon capture unit is added to an existing waste-
2
to-energy combined heat and power (CHP) plant with 60% of the waste being of
biogenic origin. The captured CO will be geologically stored. As the project has
2
elements of renewable and non-renewable energy generation it must apply as a
hybrid RES/EII project. As the waste is primarily of biogenic origin the application
may be made in the category/sector RES/Bioenergy. The carbon capture credit shall
be calculated following section 6.5 as the amount of carbon stored (including both
the fossil and biogenic fractions), minus any emissions associated with the capture,
transport, and storage of the CO . In the EII part of the calculation, the fossil CO
2 2
emissions from the waste to energy plant must be included as an emission term in
the processes box of the project scenario, even though they will be captured. The
135EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
reference emissions for the EII part of the project will be based on Case 3:
Modifications to existing production systems and include the fossil CO emissions
2
prior to the addition of the carbon capture unit. The reference emissions for the RES
part of the project will be zero unless the output of renewable energy is increased
alongside the addition of the carbon capture unit, in which case, the reference
emissions for the RES part of the project shall be based on the increased capacity
only (see section 3.2.1).
6.5 Calculation of the credit
The equation to be applied for the calculation of the carbon capture credit is described in
the following.
GHG emission
= Sinks – Sources
credit
(CC + (CC + CC + CC + CC +
CC = storage,y – capture,y injection,y EHR,y pipeline,y [6.1]

Where:
y = year of operation.
CCcredit,y = carbon capture credit. It defines the net GHG benefit delivered by a project through CO2
storage or utilisation in year y. It is calculated as a positive term for inclusion in equation [1.1]45.
65F
CCstorage,y = Amount of CO2 that is injected for permanent storage in year y, in tonnes CO2,
determined in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 on the
monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 601/2012,
especially Articles 40 to 46 and Article 49 and Annex IV, Section 21. This term is therefore equal to
the amount of CO2 captured, minus any CO2 lost to fugitive emissions, leakage or venting between
the point of capture (inclusive) and the point of permanent storage.
CCuse,y = Amount of CO2 that is incorporated into products in year y, in tonnes CO2e. This amount
may be calculated as 44/12 multiplied by the mass of carbon atoms from captured CO2 incorporated
in the products. This amount excludes any CO2 lost to fugitive emissions, leakage or venting between
the point of capture and the point of incorporation.
CCcapture,y = GHG emissions from CO2 capture activities in year y, in tonnes CO2e. This includes
emissions from fuel and input material used for compression and liquefaction of the CO2, but does
not include CO2 lost to fugitive emissions, leakage or venting during the capture process. It shall be
calculated according to Regulation (EU) 2018/2066, Annex IV, Section 21. If the CO2 is bought off
the industrial gas market from a producer who does not provide data, the estimated emissions
for the capture and transport must be included by the project applicant based on appropriate
referenced sources.
CCinjection,y = For CCS projects, GHG emissions from injection and geological storage of CO2 in a
storage site permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC in year y, in tonnes CO2e. This includes emissions
from fuel use by associated booster stations and other combustion activities including on-site power
plants; venting from injection or enhanced hydrocarbon recovery operations; fugitive emissions
during injection; breakthrough CO2 from enhanced hydrocarbon recovery operations; and leakages
45 In the unusual case in which the reference scenario includes an element of carbon capture and storage or
utilisation, the overall carbon capture credit is defined as the difference between the carbon capture credit
in the project scenario and the carbon credit in the reference scenario (CC =CC −CC ), with

during or after injection. It shall be calculated according to Regulation (EU) 2018/2066, Annex IV,
Section 23.
CCEHR,y = For projects in which CO2 injection and storage is associated with enhanced hydrocarbon
recovery (EHR), emissions consistent with stoichiometric combustion of the associated fraction of the
produced hydrocarbons. This is to be calculated as CCEHR,y = (CCstorage,y / EHRstorage,y) * HCy * %Cy *
44/12,
where EHRstorage,y is the total amount of CO2 stored at the EHR location in year y, HCy is the total
mass of hydrocarbons in tonnes produced at the EHR location in year y, and %Cy is the carbon
fraction in the produced hydrocarbons.
CCpipeline,y = GHG emissions from transport of CO2 by pipelines in year y, in tonnes CO2e. This includes
emissions from combustion and other processes at installations functionally connected to the
transport network including booster stations, but does not include CO2 lost to fugitive emissions,
leakage or venting during the transport process via pipeline. It shall be calculated according to
Regulation (EU) 2018/2066, Annex IV, Section 22.
CCtransport,y = GHG emissions from transport of CO2 via road, rail or maritime modals in year y, to be
calculated based on distance travelled, type of modal and load according to Equation [3.2] in section
6.5.1 and relevant sub equations, in tonnes CO2e.
6.5.1 GHG emissions from transportation of CO via road, rail, or maritime modals
2
This methodology assumes the transportation of the CO will be done through heavy good
2
vehicles (HGVs) when via road, and by sea tankers for maritime journeys. Related
emissions are calculated according to equation [6.2] and relevant sub-equations.
Note that the more detailed and broken-down is the information available on distance
between sites, and volume transported, the more accurate will be the calculation of
CC . Therefore, if applicants’ data is available per trip, applicants should calculate
transport,y
the emissions for each trip, using the average distance in each leg, and the amount of CO
2
transported in that exact leg (which can be derived from the estimate capacity of the
truck), and add them up, as described in the equations below. Otherwise, an approximated
estimate of the total distance travelled in the year and the total emissions transported in
the year is allowed as a proxy.
For projects submitted to the InnovFund in a small scale topic: emissions due to
transportation by road, rail and maritime modals can be disregarded from the calculation
of the GHG emissions avoidance, if the total distance travelled between the point of capture
and the point of storage is less than 5,000 kilometres.

7 Methodology for projects applying under the INNOVFUND-2024-BATT call
This section deals with the methodology to calculate the GHG emission avoidance of
projects applying under the call “Innovation Fund Call for proposals 2024 Batteries”
(INNOVFUND-2024-BATT).
Note that projects applying under the call “Innovation Fund Call for proposals 2024 Net
Zero Technologies” (INNOVFUND-2024-NTZ) shall NOT refer to this section, as the
provisions in this section do not apply to them.
This section provides the details to be used when:
• calculating the GHG emission avoidance potential of a project at the application
stage;
• reporting performance for the purposes of disbursement of the portion of the grant
that is linked to GHG emission avoidance verification; and
• reporting performance for the purposes of knowledge-sharing.46
7.1 Methodological scope
The underlying calculation model is designed to determine two key figures for the emission
reduction of battery cell manufacturing projects. Two calculation models are used for this
purpose (see Figure 7.1):
1. Manufacturing carbon footprint reduction: The project’s manufacturing
emissions are calculated against a standardised battery manufacturing reference,
considering emissions from raw materials to battery cell production (see section
7.3).
2. Absolute and relative GHG emission avoidance: The project’s GHG emission
avoidance is the sum of the battery manufacturing carbon footprint reduction and
emissions associated to the Electric Vehicle (EV) use case, including end of life
treatment, calculated against the simplified diesel reference scenario (see sections
7.4 and7.5)
The methodology for the manufacturing carbon footprint takes into account aspects of the
entire value chain, including raw material related emissions, precursors and battery
components, and the production of the battery cells. It includes life cycle stages as defined
by the EU batteries regulation (annex II)47: (a) raw materials and pre-processing, (b) main
product / cell manufacturing, (c) distribution of batteries is excluded, (d) EoL and recycling.
The calculation model is oriented towards the materials and the process chain for Li-ion
battery (LIB) cells. The model can also be applied to the production of other battery
chemistries and types. This will however require the allocation of battery technology
specific production steps to the set of pre-defined production steps for LIB cells.
The methodology for determining the absolute and relative GHG emission avoidance is
based on the assumption of an EV use case, i.e. battery pack production and the use of
the battery cells in electric vehicles for a use period of 10 years. In addition, end-of-life
46 These parameters will be reported through a dedicated knowledge-sharing report template once projects
enter into operation. The detailed knowledge-sharing requirements are spelled out in the Model Grant
Agreement, INNOVFUND-2024-BATT call text and knowledge-sharing reporting template.
47 Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2023 concerning batteries
and waste batteries, amending Directive 2008/98/EC and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and repealing Directive
2006/66/EC, http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1542/oj

treatment is considered. The reference scenario assumes the use of diesel-powered
vehicles for comparison.
Figure 7.1. Calculation of project emissions as (1) Manufacturing carbon footprint reduction and (2) Absolute and
Relative GHG emission avoidance
The Manufacturing carbon footprint reduction (1) is a subset of the GHG emission
avoidance of the project, including the EV use case (2).
7.2 System boundary
7.2.1 Steps within the project scope
The scope of projects includes manufacturing steps of battery cells that can be used in EV.
The manufacturing steps are defined below on the basis of inputs and outputs.
In addition to battery cell production, certain upstream steps can also be part of the
project’s GHG avoidance claims, provided their outputs serve as input for the project's
battery cell production. The project's battery cell production inputs can also be supplied by
external suppliers (project's own upstream outputs < 100% battery cell production inputs).
7.2.1.1 Battery cell production
Battery cell production is measured in energy storage capacity and is defined in MWh
battery cell output (quality units, successful end of line test).
Battery cell production includes electrode production (material mixing, coating, drying,
calendering) and electrode and cell assembly (slitting, vacuum drying, stacking/winding,
assembly, electrolyte filling, formation, aging, testing).
It does not include any further processing of battery cells to modules or battery packs.
141EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Inputs • Battery active materials CAM and AAM (such as NMC, NCA, LFP,
Graphite, Silicon) ready for electrode production
• Additive materials such as binders, conductive additives

LIB, a system boundary for cell production should be selected that is as comparable as
possible to the LIB process. In any case, cell production should include all processes and
components necessary to produce a functional electrochemical unit. This includes the
capability to store energy, sealing, safety and transportability. The system boundary
between cell production and material and component production should be selected in such
a way that, if possible, all essential processes that change the chemical composition of the
input materials are not part of cell production. This applies to both passive and active
materials. There may be exceptions, e.g. in the case of solid-state batteries, where the
production of the solid-state electrolyte takes place in-situ on the cell production line.
7.2.1.2 Optional: Battery cathode active material (CAM) production
This step includes mixing of pCAM materials with a Li-source, firing, post-treatment such
as washing, milling, coating. May include blending of different CAM.
Does not include purification of input materials. Does not include production of Li sources
(e.g. LiOH, Li CO ), neither refinement of Li sources to battery grade.
2 3
Inputs • Precursor CAM materials (pCAM powder) at battery grade; Li-source
such as Li CO , LiOH-H O or others at battery grade
2 3 2
• Net energy (e.g. electricity, heat, fossil fuels, hydrogen, others)
• Water, other auxiliary materials
Outputs • Cathode active materials (powder) ready for further processing in
cell production.
• Production scrap (does not have to be specified in the calculation)
Note for alternative battery systems: Some alternative battery concepts do not use
classic cathode materials such as those found in LIBs. These include, for example, metal-
air batteries or redox flow batteries. The subdivision into pCAM and CAM production is also
specific to LIB (and possibly sodium-ion battery (SIB)). In alternative battery systems,
142EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
there may well be single-stage synthesis routes. In any case, the output of CAM production
should be selected so that it is directly available as input for cell production. It is important
to ensure that, apart from transportation, there is no gap between active material
production and cell production.
The system boundaries for cell production should be selected so that all essential synthesis
processes and changes to the chemical composition of active components take place
BEFORE cell production. The system boundaries for pCAM production should be selected in
such a way that possible degrees of freedom in the chemical composition of active materials
(e.g. ratio of individual metals) are already defined in the pCAM production step.
7.2.1.3 Optional: Precursor battery cathode active material (pCAM) production
This step includes mixing of materials and precipitation of pCAM (e.g. NMC-(OH) , FePO ).
2 4
May include further steps such as milling, washing, coating or others.
Does not include purification of input materials.
Inputs • Precursor materials such as metal-oxides, -sulphates, -oxalates, -
phosphates or others at battery grade
• Net energy (e.g. electricity, heat, fossil fuels, hydrogen, others)
• Water, other auxiliary reagents such as NaOH
Outputs • Precursor cathode active materials (powder) ready for further
processing in cathode active material production.
• Production scrap (does not have to be specified in the calculation)
Note for alternative battery systems: Some alternative battery concepts do not use
classic cathode materials such as those found in LIBs. These include, for example, metal-
air batteries or redox flow batteries. The subdivision into pCAM and CAM production is also
specific to LIB (and possibly Sodium-ion batteries SIB). In alternative battery systems,
there may well be single-stage synthesis routes.
The system boundaries for pCAM production should be selected in such a way that possible
degrees of freedom in the chemical composition of active materials (e.g. ratio of individual
metals) are already defined in the pCAM production step and not in the subsequent CAM
production step.
The system boundaries to all other upstream processes should be selected in such a way
that no significant purification steps (separation of input materials) are located in pCAM
production. pCAM production includes processes that change the essential properties of
the input materials such as particle size and morphology, chemical composition and particle
aggregation.
7.2.1.4 Optional: Anode active material (AAM) production
This step includes production of graphites, silicons, LTO, metallic Li foils or other anode
active materials from precursors as well as all post-processing steps such as milling,
coating, blending, etc. The final product of anode active material production is a material
or component ready for further processing in cell production.
This step does not include the production of raw materials.
For natural graphite, this means: no mining of graphite, no separation of graphite from
other mining products. But mechanical, thermal and chemical purification steps.
143EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
For synthetic graphite this means: No production of basic feedstock such as petroleum
coke, tar or other precursors. But calcination, graphitization and purification steps.
For silicon this means: No production of metallurgical grade silicon (e.g. melt reduction),
no production of silane gas or other Si precursors. But the purification of Si to battery
grade or the synthesis of Si particles or layers from Si precursors.
For LTO this means: No production of Li sources (e.g. LiOH, Li CO ). No refinement of Li
2 3
sources. No production of titanium precursors such as TiO . But the production of lithiated
2
titanate powder.
For metallic Li-anode this means: No production of Li sources (e.g. LiCl solution). But the
reduction of Li compounds to metallic Li, purification, coating onto substrate foils, coating
with protective layers.
Inputs • Basic feedstock such as raw natural graphite, petroleum coke or tar,
metallurgical grade silicon or other Si-compounds, transition metal
compounds at battery grade, Li-compounds at battery grade
• Net energy (e.g. electricity, heat, fossil fuels, hydrogen, others)
• Water, solvents and other auxiliary reagents such as acids and bases
Outputs • Anode active materials (powder) ready for further processing in cell
production.
• Production scrap (does not have to be specified in the calculation)
Note for alternative battery systems: Some alternative battery concepts do not use
classic anode materials such as those found in LIBs. These include, for example, systems
with a Li-metal anode or other conversion type anodes (e.g. transition metal oxides) or
redox flow batteries.
The system boundaries for anode production should be selected in such a way that the
output is a material or component ready for further processing in cell production. All
essential chemical characteristics of the anode active material should be determined in the
anode active material production step.
The system boundary upstream for graphite and silicon should be defined in such a way
that the input materials can in principle also be used for non-battery applications (e.g.
other graphite qualities can be produced from raw graphite for other applications (e.g. for
electric arc furnace)). The system boundary upstream for Li-compounds and other metal
compounds should be set at battery grade.
7.2.1.5 Optional: Separator production
This step includes production of polymer-based or fiber-based separator sheets (e.g.
extrusion, stretching, drying, weaving) ready for further processing in cell production. May
include additional treatment such as coating.
Does not include the production of the polymer (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP),
others), plasticizers or fiber.
144EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
Inputs • Polymers (PE, PP, others), fibers (glass, aramid, others), plasticizers
• Inorganic coating materials
• Net energy (e.g. electricity, heat, fossil fuels, hydrogen, others)
• Water, solvents, other auxiliary materials
Outputs • Separator foil ready for further processing in cathode active material
production.
• Production scrap (does not have to be specified in the calculation)
7.2.1.6 Optional: Electrolyte production
This step includes purification and mixing of solvents (ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl
carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), others), purification and solvation of Li-salts
(LiPF , others)
6
Does not include production of solvents (e.g. production from CO and cyclic ethers), does
2
not include the production of Li-electrolyte salts (e.g. from LiF and
phosphorous/fluorine/chlorine compounds).
Inputs • Solvents (EC, DMC, DEC, others)
• Electrolyte salts (LiPF , others)
6
• Net energy (e.g. electricity, heat, fossil fuels, hydrogen, others)
• Water, solvents, other auxiliary materials
Outputs • Electrolyte solution ready to be further processed in cell production.
• Production scrap (does not have to be specified in the calculation)
Note for alternative battery systems: In solid-state batteries, the boundaries between
separator and electrolyte can easily become blurred, as both functions (electrical
insulation, ionic conduction) are performed by the same material. In this case, it is
recommended to allocate all emissions associated with production to “electrolyte
production” and to calculate “separator production” as zero.
Most alternative battery systems use electrolytes that are comparable to LIB electrolytes
(solvent and dissolved salt), so that direct transferability is given. Redox-flow batteries are
a drastic exception. It is recommended to declare the production of the electrolytes of
redox flow batteries as the production of the cathode and anode active materials and to
calculate the “electrolyte production” as zero in the GHG calculation.
7.2.2 Steps outside the project scope but within manufacturing carbon footprint
calculations
7.2.2.1 Raw material extraction and refining
The cell chemistry and material efficiency of the battery cell product define the bill of
materials. The raw materials necessary (tonnes) and the amounts required per energy
storage capacity (kg / kWh) are therefore considered in the definition of the project's
145EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
manufacturing carbon footprint. In addition, the share of recycled raw materials is
considered in the project calculations.
Default and fixed assumptions are made for the GHG footprint associated with the
extraction of raw materials, refinement and the production of battery precursors. This
means that specific emissions per ton of a metal or element are defined. The defined values
represent average values for different mining regions, different feedstocks (e.g. brine or
ore) and different precursors (e.g. LiOH or Li CO ). These emission factors are constant
2 3
across all projects and years.
The proportion of recycled materials can be specified in the manufacturing carbon footprint
calculation. Literature-based emission factors are defined for recycled materials, which
differ from the values for the primary extraction of raw materials. These emission factors
are constant across all projects and years.
The total raw materials used by the project must be specified in the GHG calculation model
as elemental equivalent (e.g. 1 kg of Li CO has the elemental equivalent of 0.188 kg
2 3
lithium). This number corresponds in principle to the sum of the bill of materials (BoM) of
the battery cells produced in the project and the unavoidable production scrap (see
7.3.3.2).
7.2.2.2 Production of Cu-current collector and Al-current collector foils and their pre-
products
Standard processes and corresponding emission factors are assumed for the production of
copper and aluminum current collector foils.
7.2.3 Steps outside the project scope but within absolute GHG emission avoidance and
relative GHG emission avoidance calculations
7.2.3.1 Battery pack production
The emissions from the production of battery packs results from the energy required for
the process and the materials used (excluding battery cells).
Battery pack production is considered in the GHG calculations with a simplified approach,
which assumes constant emission factors for all projects alike. A battery pack made of
aluminum, plastic and steel is assumed.
7.2.3.2 End of life (EoL) treatment
The ‘End-of-life' life-cycle stage begins when the product in scope (or the EV where the
battery is incorporated) is disposed of or discarded by the user and ends when the product
in scope is returned to nature as a waste product or enters another product’s life-cycle
(i.e., as a recycled input).
EoL treatment in the methodology includes battery collection and dismantling only. All
thermal or mechanical pre-treatment, separation and conversion steps (e.g.,
pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical treatment) for the production of battery material
precursors are allocated to the input phase of battery production (cut-off approach). For
this purpose, the emission factors for recyclates as input materials for battery material
production have a value greater than 0.
EoL recycling is considered in the GHG emission balance with a simplified approach, which
assumes constant emission factors for all projects alike.
7.2.4 Steps outside the project scope and outside GHG emission balance
The following production steps remain outside the manufacturing carbon footprint and
GHG emission avoidance calculations:
146EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
• All petrochemical processes through to products that could also be used for
applications other than battery components. (Non-exclusivity of materials for
battery production) (e.g. solvents like EC, DMC, DEC, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP)).
• Production of basic polymers or plastics (e.g. PP, PE).
• Production of auxiliary reagents or materials such as NaOH.
• Production of battery material binders (e.g. PVDF, CMC/SBS).
• Production of conductive electrode additives (e.g. carbon blacks, CNTs).
• Production of battery cell housing components.
• Battery application production.
• Transport of materials, components, batteries, and applications.
• Manufacturing of equipment for battery material, battery cell, battery module,
battery pack or battery system production.
• Auxiliary inputs to the manufacturing plant that are not directly related to the
battery production process (such as heating and lighting of associated office rooms,
secondary services, sales processes, administrative and research departments,
etc.).
7.3 Manufacturing carbon footprint reduction
The calculation of the manufacturing carbon footprint reduction follows the logic of project
and reference process emissions. The result of this calculation will be assessed under the
award criterion of “Manufacturing carbon footprint reduction”. In the following, the formal
mathematical approach is described.

Calculated according to Equation [9] (see section 7.3.2).
y = year of the operation.
7.3.1 Reference battery manufacturing carbon footprint
The reference life cycle and the underlying production processes and assumptions are
based on the production and use of LIBs for EVs and are briefly explained below.
7.3.1.1 Raw material and precursor production
The reference scenario values are based on a 80/20 mixture of NMC622/Graphite and
LFP/Graphite prismatic (Al case) battery cells where Graphite is a 50/50 mixture of natural
and synthetic graphite.
The default recycled content of the materials is 0 until 2031 and 6 % for Li, 16 % for Co
and 6 % for Ni in line with the requirements specified in the EU battery regulation.

7.3.1.2 pCAM, CAM and AAM production
A two-stage process (pCAM, CAM) is assumed for the production of cathode active
materials. This comprises a precipitation reaction for the Li-free pCAM and firing with a Li
source for the CAM. Emission factors per unit of weight for pCAM and CAM are defined for
148EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
the calculation of the GHG contribution. These are based on the production of LFP (via
Li CO and FePO pCAM) and NMC (via LiOH and NMC(OH) pCAM).
2 3 4 2
A multi-step process was assumed for the production of anode materials, as is typical for
the production or preparation of graphite. For synthetic graphite, three thermal steps of
calcination, carbonization and graphitization were assumed. For natural graphite, the
mechanochemical steps of flotation, spheronization, purification and coating were
assumed. The reference scenario process energy intensity and non-energy emissions are
given in section 7.6.
The bill of material is based on a 80/20 mixture of NMC622/Graphite and LFP/Graphite
battery cells where Graphite is a 50/50 mixture of natural and synthetic graphite.

7.3.2 Project manufacturing carbon footprint
The project manufacturing carbon footprint is divided into two parts:
1. Emissions directly caused by the project's activities and associated with the
project's battery cell output (e.g. from energy use or direct process emissions).
2. Emissions from the project's upstream chain from raw materials to key cell
components.
Projects must include the manufacturing of battery cells that can be used in EVs. Projects
may additionally include the manufacturing of key battery cell components. For this reason,
the boundary between 1. (project) and 2. (upstream chain) is project-dependent and must
be specified in the calculation methodology (see section 7.3.2.2).
To quantify the emissions associated with the upstream chain, the project’s bill of materials
needs to be specified (see section 7.3.2.1).
If the upstream components or parts of the upstream components are not produced
within the project boundary, their emissions are accounted for by default values, unless
the project can provide evidence justifying a divergence from the default value (see
section 7.3.2.3).
All energy consumption and direct emissions from the project's production processes
must be included in the calculation (see section 7.3.2.4).
The calculation formulas for determining the manufacturing carbon footprint and the
manufacturing carbon footprint reduction are given in section 7.3.2.5.
7.3.2.1 The project’s bill of materials
By specifying the BoM, the battery chemistry and raw material emissions have an influence
on the manufacturing carbon footprint of the project.
Absolute values for the raw material requirement need to be specified in elemental
equivalents (GHG Calculator: Manufacturing: Raw materials: Project bill of materials). The
default emission factors for raw materials are fixed and cannot be deviated from. Projects
must state the proportion of raw materials sourced from secondary sources (recycling,
GHG Calculator: Manufacturing: Raw materials: Project recycled content). These are
factored in with their own emission factors.
The bill of materials with regard to the direct upstream components of cell production
(expressed as relative BoM in kg/kWh, GHG Calculator: Manufacturing: Project bill of
materials) must be provided.
• CAM, AAM: This only includes the electrochemically active material used in the
project. Weight fractions of conductive additives, binders or other electrode
additives that are not directly involved in electrochemical energy storage can be
neglected.
• Separators: This includes the total quantity of separator foils (incl. cut-offs) used in
the project. In the case of pre-coated current collector foils (e.g. ceramics), the
total weight of the separator foil must be taken into account.
• Electrolyte: This includes the total quantity of electrolyte used in the project.
151EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
• Current collectors: This includes the total quantity of current collector foils (incl.
cut-offs) used in the project. In the case of pre-coated current collector foils (e.g.
carbon), the total weight of the current collector foils must be taken into account.
The weight of additional Cu, Al or Ni tabs and conductor bars in the battery cell can
be neglected.
7.3.2.2 Upstream components produced by the project
The share of the upstream components produced by the project of all upstream
components consumed by the project needs to be specified in the calculation (GHG
Calculator: Manufacturing: Project bill of materials: Production share within project scope).
The upstream components produced within the project boundary may not exceed the
amount required by the cell production within the project boundary. The maximum is
100%.
The energy demand and emissions of upstream component production are directly
considered as project manufacturing emissions, see section 7.3.2.4 (GHG Calculator:
Manufacturing: Project energy: Energy carriers and non-energy emissions).
7.3.2.3 Upstream components not produced by the project and emission factors
For the share of upstream components sourced from external suppliers to the project,
default emission factors for component production are assumed.
The default emission factors for any imported upstream components may be customized
by the project if the project can provide evidence that components intended to be imported
into the project will have a lower-than-default GHG footprint. Customized emission factors
can be entered in the GHG Calculator in Manufacturing: Upstream components: Emission
factors of components not produced as part of the project.
Any customised emission factors must be based on the process boundaries of the
predefined manufacturing steps for upstream components (as defined by inputs and
outputs in section 7.2.1). The GHG balance underlying the customized emission factors
must cover at least the predefined scope of the respective manufacturing steps. I.e. it is
not permissible to use a customized emission factor, e.g. for the production of cathode
material, if the process on which the factor is based does not cover the full processing of
inputs to outputs as specified in section 7.2.1.
Customised emission factors should be calculated in following the Global Battery Alliance
GHG Rulebook48 (e.g. for emission factor calculation of upstream materials based on
company activity data). The Global Battery Alliance GHG Rulebook is being developed in
alignment with the EU battery passport rules, the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF)
approach, and the Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR).
• At application stage, projects need to provide adequate evidence. For example,
MoUs with suppliers, indicating that more sustainable components will be purchased
or Heads of Terms with the relevant component supplier and carbon footprint claims
by that supplier. In addition, the applicants must propose adequate monitoring
measures in their monitoring plan to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting of
the assumptions made at the application stage. Failure to provide adequate
evidence, and an adequate monitoring plan, may affect the quality of the GHG
calculations and the resulting evaluation.
• During project implementation, failure to demonstrate the assumptions made
at the application stage, may affect the overall GHG emission avoidance or
manufacturing carbon footprint reduction that can be achieved by the project, which
48 in its currently valid version, right now: Greenhouse gas rulebook, Generic rules – Version 1.5
152EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
may have consequences in terms of grant disbursement as specified in the
INNOVFUND-2024-BATT Call Text.
The assumptions adopted at the application stage with respect to the origin of the
imported upstream components and the emission factors adopted must be confirmed as
part of the verified GHG emission avoidance report to be provided at the end of the
project, as specified in the INNOVFUND-2024-BATT Call Text.
7.3.2.4 Energy used within the project boundary (and emissions not originating from
energy production and use)
No default activity data shall be used for the declaration of the energy consumption and
the energy sources which entails that company-specific activity data are required.
Energy consumed within the project boundary is rated with fixed emission factors provided
for the different energy sources. The default emission factors for imported energy may be
altered (customized emission factors) by the project:
• If a MoU or other precontractual agreement with the renewable energy provider
can be presented with the application. In the case of electricity, the MoU or other
precontractual agreement must mention the additional nature of the electricity.
• If the project provides proof of the energy purchase during the monitoring phase
as claimed in the application.
Failure to provide adequate evidence may affect the quality of the GHG calculations and
the resulting evaluation. In addition, failure to demonstrate, during project
implementation, the assumptions made at the application stage may affect the overall GHG
emission avoidance or manufacturing carbon footprint reduction that can be achieved by
the project, which may have consequences in terms of grant disbursement as specified in
the INNOVFUND-2024-BATT Call Text.
The assumptions adopted at the application stage with respect to the origin of the energy,
the additional nature of the electricity, and the corresponding emission factor must be
confirmed as part of the verified GHG emission avoidance report to be provided at the end
of the project.
Electricity:
Electricity consumed within the project boundary is rated with a fixed emission factor based
on the average emissions of the 2030 EU grid electricity mix with an emission factor of
48.8 t CO e / TJ, based on the EU Reference Scenario 202049, independent of the
2
geographical location of the project.
If a project can prove electricity consumption through a direct line to (an) additional50
renewable electricity source(s) or (a) PPA(s) with (a) provider(s) of additional50 renewable
electricity, the corresponding share of electricity can be rated with an emission factor of
zero. The MoU or other precontractual agreement provided at application stage must
contain a statement that the electricity source will be additional.
Heat:
Heat consumed by the project is accounted for using a default emission factor (EF ). If
heat
a project can prove heat consumption and sourcing of heat with a purchase agreement,
49 Data available from https://ec.europa.eu/energy/data-analysis/energy-modelling/eu-reference-scenario-
2020_en
50 Renewable electricity shall be considered as additional if the installation generating the renewable electricity
comes into operation not earlier than 36 months before the entry into operation of the manufacturing project.
153EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
the project can deviate from the default value. The share of the energy sourced under the
purchase agreement and the verifiable emission factor must be specified annualy.
Hydrogen:
Hydrogen consumed by the project is accounted for using a default emission factor (EF ).
H2
If a project can prove hydrogen consumption and sourcing of hydrogen with a purchase
agreement, the project can deviate from the default value. The share of the energy sourced
under the purchase agreement and the verifiable emission factor must be specified
annualy.
(Natural) gas:
Natural gas consumed by the project is accounted for using a default emission factor
(EF ). If a project can prove decarbonized gas consumption and sourcing of decarbonized
NG
gas with a purchase agreement, the project can deviate from the default value. The share
of the energy sourced under the purchase agreement and the verifiable emission factor
must be specified annualy.
Other forms of energy:
For other forms of energy imported by the project, the base value for energy consumption
in TJ and an appropriate emission factor must be given. The emission factor (t CO e / TJ)
2
must be well justified and referenced, and representative of the type of energy.
Customized emission factors can be entered in the GHG Calculator in (Manufacturing:
Project energy: Zero-rated RE share and other energy emission factors).
Emissions not related to energy generation or consumption:
Project emissions not originating from energy generation or energy consumption are also
considered and need to be specified as tonnes CO e per year.

7.3.3 Dealing with additional output and scrap
7.3.3.1 Dealing with additional output
A process or facility may provide more than one function, i.e., it delivers goods and/or
services apart from the product of interest defined by the project (i.e. battery cells,
including selected upstream components as defined in the INNOVFUND-2024-BATT Call
Text). All data in the GHG calculation must refer exclusively to the product of interest.
7.3.3.2 Dealing with production scrap
Battery cell production produces unavoidable scrap (e.g. cuttings, coating at the start of a
new coil, residues in mixing vessels, etc.) and scrap due to faulty production that is in
principle avoidable.
155EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
For the purposes of GHG calculations, the reject rate due to faulty production shall be
assumed to be 0%.

7.4.1 Reference scenario
For the reference scenario, the same basic assumptions on car life within project duration
and usage of the car as for the project scenario are made (see section 7.4.2).
In addition, it is assumed that an internal combustion engine powered by diesel uses three
times as much energy as an EV. This way, the diesel consumed by the conventional vehicle
is calculated. The emission factor for diesel applied considers the lifecycle emissions of
production and combustion of the diesel. This ensures consistency with the approach taken
for battery cells here, which also considers the production phase of the battery cell.

7.4.2 Project scenario / EV use case
It is assumed that the battery cells are mounted into EVs and that each EV carries a battery
of 100 kWh capacity. For this purpose, fixed emission factors are assumed for the
production of the battery packs. These cannot be changed.
It is further assumed that each EV runs 14,300 km per year and uses 19 kWh/100km. In
order to assess Innovation Fund applications based on their long-term potential in a
decarbonised economy electricity consumed during the EV use phase is rated with an
emission factor of zero.
The use period of the EV in the calculation methodology is set as 10 years. This corresponds
at least to the current warranty periods of the automobile manufacturers. This assumption
is independent of a possibly longer real lifetime of EV batteries and cannot be changed.
The emissions of the use phase are attributed to the years in which the battery cells are
produced. No battery replacement during the use phase of the EV is assumed.
The EoL recycling of batteries in the EV use case is considered by fixed emission factors
and cannot be changed.

The terms are explained in section 7.4.
7.6 Reference data and parameters
The calculation of the manufacturing carbon footprint and the EV use case emissions are
based on assumptions and data taken from the literature.
Where possible, this methodology uses peer-reviewed global data. If only regional data
were available, data for Europe or Asia were used.
In some cases, different process options differ greatly in terms of resulting emission
factors. For example, there are several possible processes for producing battery-grade
cobalt sulphate from primary cobalt sources. In general, the data sets that were selected
were those closest to current production processes in the battery value chain. In some
cases, several transforming activities from the Ecoinvent database have been linked or
mean values of different processes, raw materials or end products were calculated.
For the reference manufacturing process, the production of battery cells using 2023 state-
of-the-art technology was assumed. The bill of materials is based on a mix of 20% lithium
iron phosphate cells (LFP) and 80% nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide cells (NMC622).
Table 7.4 and Table 7.5 present the parameters that will be deemed as constant throughout
the duration of the project, unless otherwise stated.

Appendix 1
Hierarchy of data sources for inputs and products in industrial projects,
including projects with CCS
The GHG emissions intensity and combustion emissions of inputs or products, that are
not specified elsewhere in the relevant section of the methodology, such as
section 2 for energy intensive industries (EII), and need to be sourced from
literature, will be taken from the sources listed below. Emission factors that are taken from
sources in the hierarchy should represent the typical emissions intensity for that
specific input or product.
Emissions values for heat, electricity and hydrogen are provided in the methodology and
therefore must never be taken from sources in the data hierarchy. In addition, The EU ETS
benchmark emission factors may not be used as emissions factors for inputs or products,
as the scope of the EU ETS benchmark calculation is not appropriate for this purpose.
Note that the emissions intensities are not the same as combustion emissions (which
are used for calculating the direct carbon emissions for processes in EU ETS). Emissions
intensities, which are also known for transport fuels as well-to-wheels emissions, comprises
combustion emissions and also all the “upstream” emissions from the supply chain
extraction of raw materials, all steps in the processing, transport and distribution.
Applicants should generally use values taken from the highest level at which a value is
available, looking at the hierarchyfrom the top to the bottom . If an applicant deviates from
the hierarchy (i.e. chooses to use a value from a source lower in the hierarchy when a
value is available at a higher source) the applicant must credibly justify why the value from
the lower source is a better characterisation of the typical emissions intensity of that input.
Since the values used in the GHG emission avoidance calculations should represent current
typical practices, a deviation from the hierarchy may not be justified by arguing that the
chosen value more closely represents the situation of the applicant’s supplier. Similarly,
applicants are not permitted to adjust values from the hierarchy by making alternative
assumptions about the upstream emissions for production of an input or product even if
they are able to identify specific details about the process used by their supplier. Applicants
are also not permitted to adjust values from the hierarchy to reflect the zero emission
intensity for electricity consumption that is used elsewhere in the calculations.
If using values for different inputs from more than one source at the same level of the
hierarchy, the application should explain why this was necessary; cherry-picking
favourable values is not allowed.
The hierarchy of data sources is provided below:
1. Typical emissions for production of a number of forms of biomass, biogas,
biomethane, bioliquid and biofuels are provided in Annexes V and VI of Directive
(EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018
on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (Recast).
2. Stoichiometric combustion emissions for a wide range of fuels are provided in 2019

in EU legislation” (European Commission 2019).52

4. If the data is not available at a higher level of the hierarchy, coherent data for a
different range of inputs/products may be found in JEC-WTW v.5, WTT Annexes53,
70F
which shares the same input database as the calculations in Annex V of REDII.
5. a. Calculations using input data from ECOINVENT 3.5, or more recent versions.
Calculations in ECOINVENT should use the “cut-off system model”. An equivalent
calculation may also be made in proprietary software packages (e.g., GABI, open LCA)
using the same input data. If the calculation calls for allocation of emissions between
multiple products, allocation by economic value should be selected (the database
includes the cost of products).
b. ”Official” sources, such as IPCC, IEA or governments (noting however that most
IPCC and IEA tables show combustion emissions, not lifecycle emissions intensity).
c. Other reviewed sources of data, such as E3 database, GEMIS database.
d. Peer-reviewed publications. The applicant should properly reference the source used
so that the evaluator is able to check against it, but does not have to provide a review
of the methodology adopted by the chosen source (the GHG methodology is not
prescriptive about specific LCA decisions when peer reviewed sources are used). Note
that the use of LCA-derived values is only allowed within the provisions regulating the
application of the hierarchy of data sources. It is not acceptable to simply take a value
without developing the GHG emission avoidance calculations in full alignment with the
methodology.
6. Duly documented and justified own-estimates.
7. “Grey literature”: unreviewed sources, such as commercial literature and websites. It
is not acceptable to simply take a calculated value for an entire process from the
literature without developing the GHG emission avoidance calculations in full alignment
with the methodology.

Appendix 2
Processes with a fixed ratio of outputs: definition of rigid, elastic and semi-elastic
products
Some inputs may be products of processes that produce a fixed ratio of outputs. Consider
a process that produces various outputs (principal products, non-principal products,
residues or wastes) in fixed ratios and with different prices. If the incentive for a company
to increase the production of the whole plant is proportional to the sum of the economic
value of all the outputs; the fraction of the incentive from one output is proportional to its
value-fraction in the “total value of all the products produced by the process”.
For example, if one output is a waste with zero value, its value-fraction is zero and there
is no incentive to increase overall production to supply more of it. This means the waste
has a rigid supply. At the opposite extreme, if the process only has one output, then it
represents the entire incentive to increase production, so the supply of that output will
increase with demand, its supply is elastic.
In order to reduce the administrative burden of the calculation for products that are in
between these extremes, the following simplification is applied:
A product that represents less than 10% of the value of the total products of the supplier
are treated as rigid, and their emissions calculated accordingly.
A product that represents more than 50% of the total value of the products of the supplier
are treated as elastic, and their emissions calculated accordingly.
The emissions attributed to a product that represent between 10% and 50% of the total
value of the products of the production process shall be:
(𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒 )∗(𝑉𝐹−0.1)+(𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑑 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐e)∗(0.5−𝑉𝐹)
(0.5−0.1)
where:
VF = Value Fraction of the product =
(𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡)
(𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠)
This relation is represented in the graph in Figure A2.1. This graph is only schematic; the
emissions calculated assuming the result is elastic are not necessarily higher than those
assuming that it is rigid, and calculated emissions can also be negative.
In calculating VF, the prices should be the average of the data for the last 3 years.

In practice, it is expected that the great majority of inputs fall into either the “elastic” or
“rigid” category, so the simplification is considerable in most cases.

Appendix 3
Attribution of emissions to co-products in emissions calculations for InnovFund
projects
In some cases, it may be necessary to attribute emissions associated with production of
an input between the input and its co-products. This will generally only be necessary if a
source in the data hierarchy provides a characterisation of the production process but does
not provide disaggregated emission factors for the co-products. In such cases, a simplified
version of the ISO 14044 (2006) multifunctionality framework is used to attribute
emissions to co-products, as shown in Figure A3.1.
Figure A3.1. Simplification of the ISO 14044 (2006) hierarchy for sharing emissions between co-products 54
71F
Source: European Commission internal elaboration.
In the flow chart “allocation by physical causality” at the second level requires analysis
showing the emissions consequences of changing the output of the product without
changing the output of co-products, and will often require process modelling.
At the third level, allocation shall generally be made by the economic value of the co-
products. In general, allocation by any other property (e.g., mass, chemical energy) will
only be justified in the case that the specific emissions being allocated are directly related
to that property. For example, transport emissions may be largely determined by mass or
volume of a good rather than its value.
A lack of comprehensive value data shall generally not be considered an adequate reason
to use an alternative allocation method. Where value data for a specific input is not readily
available, it should be inferred by reference to comparable inputs for which prices are
available. Alternative allocation choices would need to be well justified and should only be
used as a last analytical resort.
If any installation involved in the process to produce the input treats only one input and
no other co-products, then obviously the emissions from that installation can be ascribed
entirely to the input. Similarly, if any installation treats only the other co-products, then
its emissions may be disregarded.
If that does not completely solve the problem, the next question is whether the process
allows one to change the ratio of the co-products produced (as it is possible, for example
in a “complex” oil refinery) or whether the ratio is fixed, for example by the stoichiometry
of a chemical reaction. If the ratio of outputs is variable, allocation of emissions between
54 The option in ISO 1044 (2006) to “enlarge the system boundaries to include all the co-functions” does not
exist in this case, because we must find the emissions attributable to the “principal product(s)”, which are
already fixed. Also the option in ISO 1044 (2006) to apply substitution to by-products has been eliminated
in order to simplify calculations. Note: LP: linear programming, FU: functional unit.
175EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
products is made, if possible, by “physical causality” (level 2 of the ISO hierarchy):
calculating the effect on the process’ emissions of incrementing the output of just one
product whilst keeping the other outputs constant. This is not the same as allocating
using an arbitrary physical property of the products.
If it is impossible to make the incremental calculation just described, or if the ratio of the
products, is fixed, the 3rd level of the hierarchy is invoked. In an industrial process, the
motivation for making different products is the market value of the products. So, at this
3rd level, allocation by the economic value55 of the products is the preferred choice.
72F
Allocation by other properties, such as weight or volume, of the different products may
only be done where it can be shown that they are the “cause of the limit” of the function.
The point in the supply chain where the allocation is applied shall be at the output of the
process that produces the co-products. The emissions allocated shall include the emissions
from the process itself, as well as the emissions attributed to inputs to the process.
55 The average price over the previous 3 years should be used; any other assumption must be justified.
Objections that “the price varies” will not be considered: it is better to have a method that is approximately
correct than one which is exactly wrong.

Appendix 4
Overview of the Monitoring Reporting and Verification requirements for
Innovation Fund projects
Overview
This appendix presents an overview of the Innovation Fund Monitoring Reporting and
Verification (MRV) requirements concerning GHG emission avoidance.
When submitting their proposal, applicants shall include a detailed monitoring plan,
consisting of a complete and transparent documentation of the parameters and data
sources used in GHG calculations, and how they will be monitored during project
implementation. This can be done by completing the dedicated “Data traceability” section
in the GHG calculators, which are provided as templates in spreadsheet format.
The monitoring plan should be in line with the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)
2024/2493 of 23 September 2024 (amending Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066)
on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive
2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.
MRV specific provisions for InnovFund projects
At the reporting stage, during project operation, all measurements should be conducted
with calibrated measurement equipment according to industry standards and in line with
relevant EU ETS MRV requirements as applicable.
Each parameter monitored shall be accompanied with the following information, which shall
be included in the dedicated “Data traceability” section in the GHG calculators, provided as
templates in spreadsheet format:
• Area / Department responsible for collection and archiving.
• Data source.
• Equipment used for monitoring, including details on accuracy and calibration.
• Monitoring frequency.
• QA/QC Procedures.
• Brief description, including measurement methods and procedures.
• Reliability.
Specific MRV provisions for the different InnovFund project categories are given in the
following sub-sections.
1. Energy Intensive Industries (EII)
Considering the high heterogeneity of the sectors covered under the EII category, the
detailed list of the parameters required to be monitored is a function of the type of project.
Parameters that may not need to be monitored are listed in section 2.3, while parameters
to be monitored and reported shall include at a minimum:
• The quantities of inputs used by the project, including identification of “de minimis”
and “major inputs” following section 2.2.6.2.
• The quantities of principal and non-principal products produced by the project.
177EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
• The quantities of fuels consumed to provide energy for the processes of the project.
• The emissions of greenhouse gases associated with the operation of the project.
Either from direct measurement, of calculated from other parameters to be
monitored, as listed here, or deemed constant, as specified in section 2.3.
• Emission factors associated with biomass-derived inputs to the project.
• Origin of hydrogen used as an input by the project (see section 1.4.3.2).
For projects using biomass-derived fuels and/or materials as inputs, the applicant must
monitor the origin and type of the input for each utilised batch, demonstrate that it meets
the sustainability requirements (see section 1.4.4), and report the associated emission
factor. The emission factor must be calculated following the calculation rules of the RED.
Where available, the project may report default emission factors as detailed in Part A or
Part B of Annex V or Annex VI of the RED. Where default emission factors are not used,
the project shall either report actual emission factors calculated in accordance with the
methodology laid down in Part C of Annex V or Annex VI of the RED, or shall report typical
emission factors for the relevant input sourced from the data hierarchy, in either case
considering only the lifecycle stages specified in section 1.4.4.2.
For projects involving the manufacturing of components (section 1.3), the beneficiary shall
monitor and report the number of components manufactured and sold each year. In
addition, the beneficiary shall justify the sale volumes, cost assumptions, use period of the
component, and the performance of the relevant component, facility, or consumer product
with adequate supporting documents, such as invoices and test results.

In addition to the parameters listed above, the following parameters will be monitored and
reported for knowledge sharing purposes for projects using grid electricity, where
applicable:
• Hourly profiles for use and feed-in of grid electricity.
• Hourly profiles for generation of electricity delivered to the project from PPAs.
• Hourly profiles for avoided curtailment based on final physical notifications of co-located
RES plants or grid operator instructions.
Further details on the parameters to be monitored for knowledge-sharing purpose are
provided in the Knowledge sharing report template available on the Funding and Tenders
Portal.
2. Renewable energy
Parameters that may not need to be monitored are listed in section 3.5, while Table A4.2
presents the parameters that, at minimum, shall be monitored on an annual basis and
throughout the monitoring period of the project, and be part of the project’s monitoring
and reporting plan.
For projects using biomass-derived fuels, including bioenergy projects, the applicant must
monitor the origin and type of the input for each utilised batch, demonstrate that it meets
the sustainability requirements (see section 1.4.4), and report the associated emission
factor. The emission factor must be calculated following the calculation rules of the RED.
Where available, the project may report default emission factors as detailed in Part A or
Part B of Annex V or Annex VI of the RED. Where default emission factors are not used,
the project shall either report actual emission factors calculated in accordance with the
methodology laid down in Part C of Annex V or Annex VI of the RED, or shall report typical
emission factors for the relevant input sourced from the data hierarchy, in either case
considering only the lifecycle stages specified in section 1.4.4.2.
For projects operating stationary fuel cells consuming RFNBOs, the beneficiary shall
document the renewable origin of the fuel, and demonstrate that it meets the relevant
sustainability requirements (see section 3.1.2.1).
For projects involving the manufacturing of components (section 1.3, 3.1.3, 3.3.3), the
beneficiary shall monitor and report the number of components manufactured and sold
each year. In addition, the beneficiary shall justify the sale volumes, cost assumptions,
use period of the component, and the performance of the relevant component, facility, or
consumer product with adequate supporting documents, such as invoices and test results.

5. Credit for Carbon Capture and Storage or Utilisation
In addition to the monitoring and reporting requirements under their specific category,
projects that include a credit for carbon capture and storage or utilisation should monitor
the additional parameters listed in this sub-section. Parameters that may not need to be
monitored are listed in section 6.6, while Table A4.5 presents the parameters that, at
minimum, shall be monitored throughout the project and be part of the project’s monitoring
and reporting plan.
Note that, for projects that include a CCU component, even if the CO utilisation phase is
2
not part of the application and is carried out by a third party, the CO utilisation processes,
2
inputs, and the combustion and/or end-of-life emissions from the CCU product(s) must be
included as part of the GHG calculations (see section 2.2.5.3.1, 2.2.5.3.3, and other
relevant provisions), and must be monitored in line with the provisions for EII projects.
For the parameters for monitoring corresponding to CC CC and CC , refer
capture, pipeline injection
to the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2493 of 23 September 2024
(amending Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066) on the monitoring and reporting of
greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council, especially Articles 40 to 46 and Article 49 and Annex IV, Sections 21,
22 and 23. For estimating such emissions, the applicant may also consider the adoption of
standard ratios in GHG emissions per tonne of CO stored based on industry benchmarks,
2
should these be available.

193EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
provide at nominal conditions. The inertia capability of an energy storage plant is the
sum of the inertia capabilities of its energy storage units.
(40) ‘input power rating (or installed input capacity)’ means the (active) power, expressed
in megawatts (MW), for which the energy storage unit has been designed to operate
at nominal conditions. The input power rating of an energy storage plant is the sum
of the input power ratings of its energy storage units.

been designed to operate at nominal conditions. The installed power generation
capacity of a power plant is the sum of the installed power generation capacities of
its power units.
(44) ‘measurement system’ means a complete set of measuring instruments and other
equipment, such as sampling and data-processing equipment, used to determine

emission factor of the greenhouse gas emissions.
(45) ‘net calorific value’ (NCV) (also referred to as lower heating value, LHV) means the
specific amount of energy released as heat when a fuel or material undergoes
complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions, less the heat of
vaporisation of any water formed.

to operate at nominal conditions. The output power rating of an energy storage plant
is the sum of the output power ratings of its energy storage units
(48) ‘power plant/unit’ is a facility that generates electric power. Several power units at
one site comprise one power plant, whereas a power unit is characterised by the fact
that it can operate independently from other power units at the same site. Where
several identical power units (i.e. with the same capacity, age and efficiency) are
installed at one site, they may be considered as one single power unit.
(49) ‘proxy data’ means annual values which are empirically substantiated or derived from
accepted sources and which an operator uses to substitute the activity data or the
calculation factors for the purpose of ensuring complete reporting when it is not
possible to generate all the required activity data or calculation factors in the
applicable monitoring methodology.
(50) ‘reactive power rating’ means the maximum reactive power, expressed in volt-
ampere reactive (var) or one of its multiples, which the energy storage unit has been
designed to provide at nominal conditions. The reactive power rating of an energy
storage plant is the sum of the reactive power ratings of its energy storage units.
194EU Grants: InnovFund GHG emission avoidance methodology: V4.2 – 01.04.2025
(51) ‘rehabilitation’ or ‘refurbishment’ means an investment to restore the existing
plants/units that was severely damaged or destroyed due to foundation failure,
excessive seepage, earthquake, liquefaction, or flood. The primary objective of
rehabilitation or refurbishment is to restore the performances of the facilities.
Rehabilitation may also lead to increase in efficiency, performance or production
capacity of the plants/units with/without adding new plants/units.
(52) ‘renewable fuels of non-biological origin’ means liquid or gaseous fuels the energy
content of which is derived from renewable sources other than biomass. Definition in
line with RED.
(53) ‘replacement’ or ‘substitution’ is an investment in new plants/units that replaces one
or several existing units at the existing plant. It shall be treated as a new/greenfield
plant.
(54) ‘repowering’ means renewing power plants that produce renewable energy, including
the full or partial replacement of installations or operation systems and equipment
for the purposes of replacing capacity or increasing the efficiency or capacity of the
installation.
(55) ‘retrofit’ or ‘modification’ means an investment to repair or modify existing operating
plants/units, with the purpose to increase the efficiency or performance of the
plants/units, without adding new plants/units. Retrofits include measures that involve
capital investments and not regular maintenance or housekeeping measures.
(56) ‘Smart grids’ for the purpose of the Innovation Fund include a number of applications
which generally involve a self-sufficient electricity network system based on digital
automation technology for monitoring, control, and analysis within the supply chain.
However, in most use cases they refer to a specific component such as a smart sub-
station, an appliance or a communications solution. The reference scenario of
proposals should therefore refer to the specific use case.

195DECISION AUTHORISING THE USE OF LUMP SUMS FOR PROJECTS UNDER
THE INNOVATION FUND
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/856 of 26 February 2019
supplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with
regard to the operation of the Innovation Fund1 (the ‘Innovation Fund Regulation’), and in
particular Articles 5 and 6 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union2
(the ‘Financial Regulation’), and in particular Articles 125 and 181 thereof,
Whereas:
1) The Innovation Fund is one of the key Union financing programmes contributing to the
achievement of the European Green Deal objectives. The Innovation Fund aims at
supporting the demonstration of highly innovative technologies, processes or products that
are sufficiently mature and have a significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
2) With a view to making adequate financial resources timely available to the selected
projects, the emphasis should be put on the performance and results, and grant
disbursement should be based on simple rules.
3) Simple funding rules reduce the administrative costs for participation and contribute to the
prevention and reduction of financial errors. In this respect, the use of lump sums is
appropriate to simplify the calculation of grant amounts, to significantly decrease the
workload of both the beneficiaries and the granting authority as well as to accelerate
payment procedures.
4) The use of lump sums should therefore be authorised for all projects applying for grants
awarded on the basis of Article 12 or 12a of the Innovation Fund Regulation.
THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN DECIDED:
Sole Article
The use of the Union contribution in the form of lump sums contribution is authorised for the
projects under the Innovation Fund for the reasons and under the conditions set out in the
Annex.

2.0 […] • The first section (Forms of the Innovation Fund grant and
relevant costs) has been amended to:
o Clarify that this Decision only authorises the use of
lumpsum contribution to grants awarded under Articles 12
and 12a of the Innovation Fund Regulation.
o Remove the reference to small-scale projects which, with
the revision of the Innovation Fund Regulation in November
2023, are subject to the same definition of relevant costs
as large-scale projects.
• Section 2 (Justification) has been amended to:
o Indicate that transport sectors are now included in the
scope of the Innovation Fund (in line with the revision of
Directive 2003/87/EC in June 2023).
o Align the wording on mitigating the risks of fraud and
irregularities to better align with the requirements of Article
181 of the Financial Regulation.
• Section 3 (Method to determine and update the amount of the
Innovation Fund grant in the form of lump sum contributions)
has been amended to:
o Align this Decision with the Innovation Fund Regulation,
which now allows the Commission to choose between two
relevant cost calculation methodologies for each call for
proposals.
o Update the list of information that applicants must provide
to the granting authority.
o Remove the methodologies’ calculation details, which may
vary from one call for proposals to another and which are
therefore better specified exhaustively in the relevant call
documentation.
o Merge sections 3.2.1 to 3.2.7 into a single section 3.2.
o Remove references to general grant management practices
in section 3.2 (such as grant reduction rules).
o Specify that the relevant costs of the selected projects will
be audited when they enter into operation.Annex
1. Forms of the Innovation Fund grant and relevant costs
The Union contribution for the projects selected under Article 12 or 12a of the Innovation Fund
Regulation shall exclusively take the form of lump sum contributions.
The lump sum contribution shall cover a part of the projects’ relevant costs, which are defined
as the net extra costs that are borne by the project proponent as a result of the application of
the innovative technology related to the reduction or avoidance of the greenhouse gas
emissions.
The payment of the lump sums shall be subject to the achievement of the defined outputs in
accordance with Annex 1 to the grant agreement during the period which will be set in the grant
agreement.
The applicants shall be required to provide, in their application, the estimated relevant costs
and the lump sum contributions they apply for, broken down by participant and work package.
The applicants shall describe the activities that are covered by the lump sum contribution for
each work package and, based on requirements of the text of the call, the conditions that need
to be met in order to consider the work package completed (the milestone, in the meaning of
Article 6(1) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/856, is achieved). This
description will become part of Annex 1 to the grant agreement.
The amount of each work package making up the lump sum contributions shall be paid if the
corresponding work packages of the action have been properly implemented in accordance
with Annex 1 to the grant agreement.
The amounts of the lump sum contribution shall be calculated in accordance with point 3.
2. Justification
Lump sum contributions are considered appropriate with regard to:
2.1. The nature of the supported projects
The Innovation Fund is one of the main instruments to achieve the Green Deal objectives and
secure the Union transition into the carbon neutral economy by 2050 through the funding of
highly innovative low-carbon technology demonstration projects in energy-intensive industry,
transport sectors renewable energy, energy storage, carbon capture, use (CCU) or storage
(CCS).
The main aim of the Innovation Fund is to bridge the financing gap of eligible projects by
providing rapid and timely support. This can only be achieved through the simplification of
procedures and reduction of administrative burden.
Unlike the reimbursement of actual costs, results-based lump sum funding has considerable
potential for administrative simplification. It eliminates all obligations on reporting costs
actually incurred and financial audits, thus removing a major part of the administrative burden
on beneficiaries and enabling efficiency gains in the implementation of the Innovation Fund.
At the same time, lump sum funding strongly increases the focus on the performance and output
of projects, thus improving the quality of results.
In addition, the use of lump sums substantially reduces the risk of error for beneficiaries.The payment of the lump sums is strictly output-based. In other words, the lump sums shall be
only paid out upon the completion of the work packages.
2.2. Risks of irregularities and fraud and costs of control
The lump sums are output-based, and the risk of fraud is mitigated since payment is subject to
the timely achievement of the pre-defined outputs which are clearly described in the grant
agreement and easily subject to verification. The granting authority will verify compliance with
the achievement of the outputs following reporting by the beneficiary (through technical
checks, reviews or audits).
The risk of irregularities will be minimised due to the fact that there is no reporting of actual
costs. Beneficiaries will have no obligation vis-à-vis the granting authority to document costs
incurred for the action but they remain subject to the financial reporting obligations and
accounting rules under the applicable national law.
Checks, reviews, and audits will instead focus on achievement of results and the proper
implementation of the action, in particular on the fulfilment of the essential conditions for
triggering payment of the lump sum contribution per work package.
The costs of controls for the actions are also reduced by the lack of reporting on financial costs
and the focus on achievement of outputs.
3. Method to determine and update the amount of the Innovation Fund grant in the
form of lump sum contributions
3.1. Definition of relevant costs
Applicants will have to indicate in their submission form the amount of the Innovation Fund
grant requested. In accordance with Article 10a(8) of the Directive 2003/87/EC3, this amount
cannot exceed 60% of the project’s relevant costs. Therefore, applicants must also present and
calculate the relevant costs of their projects so that the granting authority can verify compliance
with this ceiling.
The relevant costs shall be the net extra costs that are borne by the project proponent as a result
of the application of the innovative technology related to the reduction or avoidance of
greenhouse gas emissions.
3.2. The calculation of relevant costs and adjustment of the lumpsum contributions
The net extra costs shall be calculated in accordance with one of the following two
methodologies:
• The ‘Reference Plant’ methodology, whereby net extra costs shall be the difference
between (i) the best estimate of economic costs (covering investment and operation)
and economic revenues and operational benefits, and (ii) the best estimate of the
economic costs and revenues and operational benefits of a project using a conventional
technology with the same capacity in terms of effective production of the analogous
final product.
3 Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of The council of 13 October 2003 establishing a
system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive
96/61/EC, OJ L 275 25.10.2003, p. 32• The ‘No Reference Plant’ methodology, whereby net extra costs shall be the difference
between the best estimate of (i) the economic costs (covering investment and operation)
and (ii) the economic revenues and operational benefits.
For each call, the granting authority will indicate and further specify in the call documentation
the applicable methodology or methodologies.
The key parameters that the applicants will be required to use in the calculation of the relevant
costs will be based on standard financial information that typically forms the basis of a project
financing model. Applicants will be required to provide the necessary financial information in
order to fill out the following items of the mandatory Financial Information File published as
part of the call documentation:
1. A Financial Model Summary Input Sheet including an overview of the financial
projections of CAPEX, OPEX, revenues, operational benefits, Maintenance CAPEX
and WACC of the project.
2. Detailed inputs in to CAPEX calculations
3. Additional inputs to Relevant Costs calculation when “Reference plant” methodology
is applied.
4. A table with Innovation Fund grant breakdown per work package and
beneficiary/affiliated entity.
Applicants must provide a complete set of data in order to accurately calculate relevant costs.
In addition, the relevant costs calculation shall be checked and its corectness confirmed by a
statement from an independent auditor when the project enters into operation. If the relevant
costs have decreased and, as a result, the grant amount exceeds 60% of the recalculated costs,
the grant amount will be reduced so that it will stay within the limits of 60% of the relevant
costs.
3.3. Evaluation of the proposal
Applicants shall be required to follow the relevant costs calculation methodology provided in
the call text. Detailed calculation of relevant costs, including the justification of the
assumptions and data sources used for the calculation, shall form a part of the application. The
budget for each work-package should be proportional to the activities covered by the work
package.
The applications shall be evaluated by external evaluators, selected by the granting authority.
These external evaluators will use publicly available benchmark data and follow the
methodology described in the guidance attached to the call.
In the evaluators’ selection procedure, particular attention is given to their knowledge and
capacity to assess complex projects from technical, financial and legal point of view. The
external evaluations shall have operational experience in the sectors of the Innovation Fund
and shall need to be proven free of Conflict of Interest.
Each proposal will be evaluated by at least 3 external evaluators who will be given appropriate
time to assess the proposal individually and during a consensus meeting with other evaluators.
3.4 Calculation of the lump sum contribution amount
The evaluators will assess whether the total lump sum amount requested does not go beyond
the 60% ceiling and is determined correctly based on the relevant cost calculation and
appropriately reflects the funding needs estimates included in the application form.
The final amount of the lump sum contribution shall be set in the grant agreement.4. Sound financial management and co-financing principles and absence of double
financing
The methodology described in Section 3 complies with the principles of co-financing and
absence of double funding as required by the Financial Regulation.
The co-financing principle is complied with by fixing the lump sum contribution ex ante
taking into account the reimbursement rates (up to 60% of the relevant costs) provided for in
Article 10a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC.
Double funding shall be avoided by excluding ineligible contributions for activities already
funded under other EU grants (or grants awarded by a Member State, third country or other
body implementing the EU budget), except where the grants are part of jointly coordinated
synergy actions and the funding under the grants does not go above 100% of the costs and
contributions declared to them. For this purpose, applicants will be requested to indicate, in
the application form, any other public support provided to the project. Where the application
indicates additional Union support, the granting authority shall, where necessary, consult
concerned Commission services and shall adjust, where necessary, the final amount(s) of EU
contribution(s) accordingly.
Sound financial management is ensured because the eligible costs of the project will be
assessed by the Commission as being a reliable proxy of the real costs. This will be ensured
through a thorough and extensive evaluation process, as detailed in point 3.3. Moreover, the
Innovation Fund contribution will cover only 60% of relevant costs. In accordance with the
fourth sub-paragraph of Article 10a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC, the grant will be
complementary to substantial co-financing of the project proponent, i.e. the majority of the
total project costs will be borne by the project proponents.

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting
authority for implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance
with all the obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action
under their own responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated
entities or other participants (see Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the
granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the
beneficiaries fails to implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure
that this part is implemented by someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the
maximum grant amount and subject to an amendment; see Article 39). The financial
responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding
the grant for the entire duration of the action. Lump sum contributions will be eligible only as
long as the beneficiary and the action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see
Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the
implementation of the action (see Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the prefinancing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements
(CFS): not applicable
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article
21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority
under the Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their
affiliated entities.
19Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and
the granting authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies
otherwise, and in particular:
- submit the prefinancing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify
their quality and completeness before passing them on to the granting
authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other
beneficiaries (report on the distribution of payments; if required, see
Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other
beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other
beneficiary or third party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii)
last indent and (iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have
created or which are controlled by or affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains
sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance with the obligations under the
Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’15 (or similar, such as European research
infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to
one of their members. The coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the
obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-
ordination, to ensure that the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
15 For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy
the criteria for being awarded a grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole
beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the purpose of implementing the action
financed by the grant.”
20Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of
recoveries (if any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article
16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked actions, the beneficiaries must have
arrangements with the participants of the other action, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the
consortium is the same, as part of their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of
outputs, common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy
activities, common communication and dissemination activities, sharing of
information, access to background and results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in
both actions.
The arrangements with the participants of the other action must not contain any provision
contrary to this Agreement.]
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
[OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The following entities which are linked to a beneficiary
will participate in the action as ‘affiliated entities’:
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short
name)]
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short
name)]
[same for more AE]
Affiliated entities can charge lump sum contributions to the action under the same conditions
as the beneficiaries and must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in
accordance with Article 11.
Their contributions will be included in Annex 2 and will be taken into account for the
calculation of the grant.
21Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
The beneficiaries must ensure that all their obligations under this Agreement also apply to
their affiliated entities.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority,
OLAF, Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the affiliated
entities.
Breaches by affiliated entities will be handled in the same manner as breaches by
beneficiaries. Recovery of undue amounts will be handled through the beneficiaries.
If the granting authority requires joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see Data
Sheet, Point 4.4), they must sign the declaration set out in Annex 3a and may be held liable in
case of enforced recoveries against their beneficiaries (see Article 22.2 and 22.4).]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable]
ARTICLE 9 — OTHER PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN THE ACTION
9.1 Associated partners
[OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The following entities which cooperate with a
beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘associated partners’:
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number]
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number]
[same for more AP]

their obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical
principles, environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information,
intellectual property rights, visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use qualified external auditors

Special rules on dispute settlement apply (see Data Sheet, Point 5).
10.2 Participants which are international organisations
Participants which are international organisations (IOs; if any) undertake to comply with their
obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical
principles, environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information,

agreements concluded by them and the EU (if any).
For such participants, nothing in the Agreement will be interpreted as a waiver of their
privileges or immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or international law.
Special rules on applicable law and dispute settlement apply (see Article 43 and Data Sheet,
Point 5).
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
Pillar-assessed participants (if any) may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in so
far as they have been positively assessed and do not call into question the decision awarding
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and
procedures which participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control
system, accounting system, external audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and
exclusion, information on recipients and protection of personal data; see Article 157 EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and
procedures, in particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards,
rules and procedures
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in
accordance with usual accounting practices
17 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of
annual accounts and consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).

EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, prefinancing guarantees are not
needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their
regular internal or external auditors and in accordance with their internal
financial regulations and procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if
those practices are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no
recovery if the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue
amounts from the third party receiving the support (including legal proceedings)
and non-recovery is not due to an error or negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be
conducted taking into account the rules and procedures specifically agreed
between them and the framework agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the
participant’s internal rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment
will be calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into
before the pre-information letter was received and could not reasonably be
terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated
for damage it sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because
the action was not implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the
damage is due to an infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures
or due to a violation of third parties’ rights by the participant or one of its
employees or individual for whom the employees are responsible.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do
purchases, subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance
with their internal rules and procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal
standards, rules and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
25Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the
grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use),
communication, dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems,
rules and procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules
and procedures that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately
inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU,
may moreover — under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the
decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries) — rely on the provisions set out in that framework agreement.

If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the
grant or the coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in
Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 22 — PAYMENTS AND RECOVERIES — CALCULATION OF
AMOUNTS DUE
22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
36Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.2) and must be distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to
distribution of the initial prefinancing payment; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment
obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date
when they are debited to its account.
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it
turns out that the granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts
undue.
The general liability regime for recoveries (first-line liability) is as follows: At final payment,
the coordinator will be fully liable for recoveries, even if it has not been the final recipient of
the undue amounts. At beneficiary termination or after final payment, recoveries will be made
directly against the beneficiaries concerned.
Beneficiaries will be fully liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4):
- the beneficiaries will be jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of another
beneficiary under the Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
- affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of their beneficiaries under the
Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority
(see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).
22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Prefinancing payments
The aim of the prefinancing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
For additional prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous
37Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
prefinancing payment shows that less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data
Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the 70% threshold and the amount used.
Prefinancing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent)
against amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to
that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
In case of beneficiary termination, the granting authority will determine the provisional
amount due for the beneficiary concerned.
This will be done on the basis of work packages already completed in previous interim
payments. Payments for ongoing/not yet completed work packages which the beneficiary was
working on before termination (if any) will therefore be made only later on, with the next
interim or final payments when those work packages have been completed.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary,
on the basis of the beneficiary’s lump sum contributions for the work packages which were
approved in previous interim payments
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the
distribution of payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{ total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments received (if
any)}}.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
38Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this
amount to be paid to the coordinator (confirmation letter).
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible lump sum contributions claimed for work packages
implemented during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out
the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report and the work packages declared.
Their approval does not imply recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or
correctness of their content.
Incomplete work packages and work packages that have not been delivered or cannot be
approved will be rejected (see Article 27).
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the
reporting period, by calculating the lump sum contributions for the approved work packages.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary
termination (if any). The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of prefinancing and
interim payments (if any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the remaining eligible lump sum
contributions claimed for the implemented work packages (if any).
39Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report and the work packages
declared. Their approval does not imply recognition of compliance, authenticity,
completeness or correctness of their content.
Work packages (or parts of them) that have not been delivered or cannot be approved will be
rejected (see Article 27).
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all
reporting periods, by calculating the lump sum contributions for the approved work packages.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Not applicable
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Not applicable
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of prefinancing
and interim payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{
final grant amount
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments made (if
any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
40Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and date for payment.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see
Article 25) — the granting authority rejects lump sum contributions (see Article 27) or
reduces the grant (see Article 28), it will calculate the revised final grant amount for the
beneficiary concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the
beneficiary, by calculating the ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total
accepted EU contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its
share in the final grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is
calculated as follows:
{{
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the
action}
multiplied by
}
final grant amount for the action .
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
41Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons
why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be
recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent —
against any amounts owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may
be offset before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU
executive agency, debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other
Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) by drawing on the financial guarantee(s) (if any)
(c) by holding other beneficiaries jointly and severally liable (if any; see Data Sheet, Point
4.4)
(d) holding affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that the granting authority is the
European Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable
decision under Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and
Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in
Article 22.5, from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including
the date the full payment is received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and
then against the principal.
42Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless
Directive 2015/236621 applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by
offsetting or enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission
(see also Article 43).
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the
beneficiaries are entitled to late-payment interest at the reference rate applied by the
European Central Bank (ECB) for its main refinancing operations in euros, plus the
percentage specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The ECB reference rate to be used is the
rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as published
in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the
coordinator only on request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional
and local government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State
for the purpose of this Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not
be considered as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for
payment (see above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.
22.5.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28) and the grant or the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 23 — GUARANTEES
23.1 Prefinancing guarantee
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2), the beneficiaries must
provide (one or more) prefinancing guarantee(s) in accordance with the timing and the
amounts set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them to the granting authority in due time before the
prefinancing they are linked to.
21 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment
services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and
Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (OJ L 337, 23.12.2015, p. 35).
43Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
The guarantees must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the
following conditions:
(a) be provided by a bank or approved financial institution established in the EU or — if
requested by the coordinator and accepted by the granting authority — by a third party
or a bank or financial institution established outside the EU offering equivalent
security
(b) the guarantor stands as first-call guarantor and does not require the granting authority
to first have recourse against the principal debtor (i.e. the beneficiary concerned) and
(c) remain explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the
form of a recovery, until five months after the debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
They will be released within the following month.
23.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If the beneficiaries breach their obligation to provide the prefinancing guarantee, the
prefinancing will not be paid.
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.

The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and
will be formally notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement.
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights
of checks, reviews and audits as the granting authority.
25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the
periodic assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.
25.4 OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations

46Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures
described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount
(see Article 22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may
lead to a request for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set
out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities,
fraud or breach of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU
grants awarded under similar conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Findings of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this
grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions, to have committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or
breach of obligations that have a material impact on this grant and
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the
list of grants affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to
extend the findings and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of lump sum contributions: the notification will
include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors, to calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or
practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
47Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations,
revised financial statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction
method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the
implementation (i.e. start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the
revised financial statements or the announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see
Articles 27 and 28).
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, lump sum contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the
objectives and indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit
set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or
beneficiaries and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact
of the action, including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may
apply the measures described in Chapter 5.
CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at interim payment, final payment or afterwards — reject any
lump sum contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in particular following checks,
reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
48Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant
(see Article 25).
Ineligible lump sum contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The
coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification —
submit observations if it disagrees with the rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects lump sum contributions, it will deduct them from the
contributions declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery;
see Article 22).
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards —
reduce the grant for a beneficiary, if:
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and
proportionate to the seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach
of obligations, by applying an individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the
reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving
49Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the reduction (payment review
procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the
amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment
cannot be processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or
additional information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing extension procedure,
queries about eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons
why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will
be lifted — and the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to
confirm if the suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the
revised report is not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority
may also terminate the grant or the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for
one or more beneficiaries, if:
50Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make
partial payment(s) for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the
payment (or recovery) of the remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to
be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the
coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting
authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the
suspension end date.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For
interim payments, the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article
21) must not contain any financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated
entities). The coordinator must include them in the next periodic report after the suspension is
lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of the action — in the last periodic report.

EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional
circumstances — in particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation
impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission
of the amendment request and
- the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately
request another amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption
date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes
necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been
terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the suspension end
date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no work may be done.
Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new work packages may be started.
31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
52Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(c) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA suspension grounds: not applicable.
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification).
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority
will formally notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the
suspension end date and invite the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to
set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the
grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the
suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be before the date
on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no work may be done.
Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new work packages may be started.
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see
Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a
beneficiary (see Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
53Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a
periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of
the report submitted and taking into account the lump sum contributions for activities
implemented before the end of work date (see Article 22). Partial lump sum contributions for
work packages that were not completed (e.g. due to technical reasons) may exceptionally be
taken into account.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only lump sum
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries,
on request of the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
54Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment
request must be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date day specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting
period until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary;
change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the
reports submitted in previous interim payments (i.e. beneficiary’s lump sum contributions for
completed and approved work packages).
Lump sum contributions for ongoing/not yet completed work packages will have to be
included in the periodic report for the next reporting periods when those work packages have
been completed.
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into
question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant
termination (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21
(reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27
(rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.

EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
32.3 EU-initiated GA or beneficiary termination
32.3.1 Conditions
The granting authority may terminate the grant or the participation of one or more
beneficiaries, if:
(a) one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 40)
(b) a change to the action or the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership
situation of a beneficiary is likely to substantially affect the implementation of the
action or calls into question the decision to award the grant (including changes linked
to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour)
(c) following termination of one or more beneficiaries, the necessary changes to the
Agreement (and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
(d) implementation of the action has become impossible or the changes necessary for its
continuation would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants
(e) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is subject to bankruptcy
proceedings or similar (including insolvency, winding-up, administration by a
liquidator or court, arrangement with creditors, suspension of business activities, etc.)
(f) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is in breach of social
security or tax obligations
(g) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been found guilty of
grave professional misconduct
(h) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed fraud,
corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money laundering, terrorism-
related crimes (including terrorism financing), child labour or human trafficking
(i) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) was created under a
different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social or other legal
obligations in the country of origin (or created another entity with this purpose)
(j) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.)
56Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
(k) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in
other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(l) despite a specific request by the granting authority, a beneficiary does not request —
through the coordinator — an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of
one of its affiliated entities or associated partners that is in one of the situations under
points (d), (f), (e), (g), (h), (i) or (j) and to reallocate its tasks, or
(m) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA termination grounds: not applicable.
32.3.2 Procedure
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting
authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will
take effect (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is
discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also
inform the coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit
a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the
basis of the report submitted and taking into account the lump sum contributions for
activities implemented before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Partial lump
sum contributions for work packages that were not completed (e.g. due to technical
reasons) may exceptionally be taken into account
57Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator
may not submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only lump
sum contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see
Article 28) or to impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority
(see Article 33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —
submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open
reporting period until termination, containing an overview of the progress
of the work
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated
beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of
the reports submitted in previous interim payments (i.e. beneficiary’s lump sum
contributions for completed and approved work packages).
Lump sum contributions for ongoing/not yet completed work packages will have to be
included in the periodic report for the next reporting periods when those work
packages have been completed.
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments
within the deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned
and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
58Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal
treatment of applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND ADMINISTRATIVE
SANCTIONS
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to
third parties as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross
negligence.

beneficiaries or other participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the
implementation of the Agreement.
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a
result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full
compliance with the Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.

SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot
be considered in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement,
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control,
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants

Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without
delay, stating the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force
majeure and do their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.
CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal, in accordance with the
Portal Terms and Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if
explicitly instructed otherwise by the granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the grant agreement (project
number and acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and
Conditions. For naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated —
before the signature of this Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’.
The role and tasks of the LEAR are stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms
and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the
Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of
sending, as indicated by the time logs.
60Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the
communication is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not
been accessed within 10 days after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general
principles apply (i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with
proof of delivery will be considered to have been received either on the delivery date
registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be
considered in breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Addresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is
the official mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.
ARTICLE 37 — INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT
The provisions in the Data Sheet take precedence over the rest of the Terms and Conditions of
the Agreement.
Annex 5 takes precedence over the Terms and Conditions; the Terms and Conditions take
precedence over the Annexes other than Annex 5.
Annex 2 takes precedence over Annex 1.
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7125, periods expressed in days, months or years are
calculated from the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement
which would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
25 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to
periods, dates and time-limits (OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
61Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in
the Portal Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries
(see Annex 3). If a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission
must be done by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or
proof that this opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45
days of receiving notification (or any additional information the granting authority has
requested). If it does not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same
deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no
notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the
amendment.
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession
form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry
into force of the Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
its entry into force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must
— within 30 days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and
make any changes necessary to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not
affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
62Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with
Article 39. It must include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary
directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the
grant to a new beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal
Amendment tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE
GRANTING AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting
authority to any third party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority
on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed,
the assignment will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations

EU Grants: INNOVFUND Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.1 – 01.11.2024
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties
must bring action before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice —
under Article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium — unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU
court judgements.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet,
Point 5), the dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in
accordance with the Rules for Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under
Article 299 TFEU (see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the
General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions
against offsetting and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European
Commission (not against the granting authority; see also Article 22).
ARTICLE 44 — ENTRY INTO FORCE
The Agreement will enter into force on the day of signature by the granting authority or the
coordinator, depending on which is later.

1. Background
The Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/856 of 26 February 2019, defines
Relevant Costs in Article 5(1), as follows:
The Relevant Costs shall be the net extra costs that are borne by the project proponent
as a result of the application of the innovative technology related to the reduction or
avoidance of the greenhouse gas emissions.
The net extra costs shall be calculated as the difference between (i) the best estimate
of economic costs (covering investment and operation) and economic revenues and
operational benefits, and (ii) the best estimate of the economic costs and revenues and
operational benefits of a project using a conventional technology with the same capacity
in terms of effective production of the analogous final product.
The Commission may also decide that the Relevant Costs shall be the net extra costs,
calculated as the difference between the best estimate of (i) the economic costs
(covering investment and operation) and (ii) the economic revenues and operational
benefits.
The latter methodology described in the article above will be referred to in this
document as the “No reference Plant” methodology while the former methodology
(where the calculation includes a comparison with a conventional technology) will be
referred to in this document as the “Reference plant” methodology.
4EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
2. Relevant Costs methodologies
As mentioned in the background section, two Relevant Costs methodologies exist to
compute the Relevant Costs of a Project which constitute the basis for calculating the
Innovation Fund Grant: the No reference plant (Option 1) and the Reference plant
(Option 2) methodologies. The No reference plant methodology is the default option to
use. Only under the specific conditions set out in this document may the Reference
plant methodology be used as a fall back option.
These methodologies apply to all sizes of Projects (small-scale, medium-scale or large-
scale Projects) and to all topics as defined in the Innovation Fund calls for proposals
(except to the Innovation Fund auction calls).
2.1 Description of the methodologies
2.1.1 Option 1 – The No reference plant
Option 1 is the default option and corresponds to the provision of the Innovation Fund
Delegated Regulation which defines the Relevant Costs as “the net extra costs,
calculated as the difference between the best estimate of (i) the economic costs
(covering investment and operation) and (ii) the economic revenues and operational
benefits.”
More specifically, the Relevant Costs shall be calculated using the best estimate of the
undiscounted total eligible Project capital expenditure (CAPEX) and the Net Present
Value (NPV)1 of the eligible Project Revenues, Operational Benefits, Maintenance
CAPEX, and Operational Costs (OPEX), arising over the first ten years of the Project’s
operation. This is the default methodology for all Projects.
2.1.2 Option 2 – The Reference plant methodology
Option 2 is the-fall back option and corresponds to the provision of the Innovation Fund
Delegated Regulation which defines the Relevant Costs as “the difference between (i)
the best estimate of economic costs (covering investment and operation) and economic
revenues and operational benefits, and (ii) the best estimate of the economic costs and
revenues and operational benefits of a project using a conventional technology with the
same capacity in terms of effective production of the analogous final product.”
This methodology compares the eligible Project CAPEX and the NPV of the eligible
Project Revenues, Operational Benefits, Maintenance CAPEX and OPEX arising over the
first ten years of operation to those of a Reference Plant or unit of the same size and
output using a conventional technology.
This fall-back methodology must not be used in the case of modification of an existing
plant/unit (for instance building or transforming a part of the existing installation) or
integration of only parts of the equipment, system or process of a new plant/unit. In
this instance, applicants shall use the No reference plant methodology and consider
the incremental step to the production process as the Innovation Fund Project.
The Reference plant methodology may only be used if:
- The Innovation Fund Project relates to the building and operation of a new
plant/unit;
- The Reference Plant/unit has similar characteristics in terms of capacity and
output as the Innovation Fund Project;
1 Net Present Value (NPV) is the difference between the present value (PV) of cash inflows and present value
of cash outflows with a specific discount rate.
5EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
- The Reference Plant complies with the European Union environmental standards
and with EU legislation, including the EU ETS benchmark for industrial products
where relevant2;
- Applicants provide the documents necessary to assess the credibility of the
financial and technical data of the Reference Plant, including: proof of planning
of such a (reference) plant/unit as an alternative to the project, formal board
documents, financial reports, internal business plans or studies. These
documents must include the description of assumptions underlying the financial
data and calculations (notably for the WACC, price, volumes, inflation rate used
to calculate projected revenues, CAPEX, OPEX, Maintenance Capex), where
relevant supported by quotes from (potential) suppliers and customers and by
external market studies if available;
- A complete and detailed set of verifiable financial projections including CAPEX,
Revenues, Operational Benefits, Maintenance CAPEX, and Operational Costs
(OPEX) for the Reference Plant is added to the applicant’s detailed financial
model.
2.2 Selection of the appropriate Relevant Costs methodology
In order to harmonize the Relevant Costs calculation among applicants, the “default”
methodology is Option 1: the No reference plant methodology, that should be suitable
for all Projects.
In situations where a Reference Plant can be defined as described in section 2.1.2
above, applicants may use Option 2: the Reference plant methodology. In this “fall
back” methodology, the Project costs and revenues are compared to the CAPEX, OPEX,
Maintenance CAPEX and revenues of a plant/unit with conventional technology
complying with European Union environmental standards and with EU legislation,
including the EU ETS benchmarks for industrial products (where relevant).
Applicants will need to decide whether or not to apply the default methodology of Option
1. When choosing Option 2, applicants will have to demonstrate that the conditions for
using the Reference plant methodology listed in section 2.1.2 apply and ensure the
traceability and transparency of the calculations. Applicants must demonstrate that
they fulfill these conditions and justify the choice of Option 2 in the specific box on Cost
Efficiency in the Application Form Part B.
If the data is not fully available and/or the estimated values for the Reference Plant
cannot be justified in full transparency, applicants must use the “No reference plant”
methodology.
Insufficient demonstration that the conditions for the use of the Reference Plant
methodology are satisfied will be penalized during the evaluation and may lead to a
score below the threshold for the quality of the Cost Efficiency ratio.
2 A product benchmark is based on the average GHG emissions of the best performing 10% of the
installations producing that product in the EU and EEA-EFTA states. Applicants should refer to: Commission
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/447 of 12 March 2021 determining revised benchmark values for free
allocation of emission allowances for the period from 2021 to 2025 pursuant to Article 10a(2) of Directive
2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Available at: https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2021/447.
6EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
3. Calculation of Relevant Costs
3.1 The No reference plant methodology [Option 1]
Under the “No Reference” methodology, the Relevant Costs are calculated as follows:
Relevant Costs = CAPEX + PV of OPEX + PV of Maintenance CAPEX – PV of
Operational Benefits – PV of Revenues
Where PV stands for Present Value; CAPEX, OPEX, Maintenance CAPEX, Operational
Benefits and Revenues are defined in the Glossary of Appendix 1.
CAPEX : Project Capital Expenditure incurred before the entry into operation of the
Project;
PV of OPEX : Present Value of Project Operational Expenditure;
PV of Maintenance CAPEX : Present Value of Project Maintenance CAPEX incurred
after the entry into operation of the Project;
PV of Operational Benefits : Present Value of Project Operational Benefits;
PV of Revenues : Present Value of Project Revenues.
This methodology derives the Relevant Costs as the best estimate of the total CAPEX
and the NPV of Revenues, OPEX, maintenance CAPEX and Operational Benefits arising
during construction and over the first ten years of operation after the Project’s
entry into operation3. The PV (and hence the NPV) should be computed using the
Project Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) described in section 3.4.4 below.
Any additional revenues of the Project (for example in the form of monetisation of the
by-products value(s)) or cost savings must also be included in the calculation.
Applicants should pay attention to the parameters described in section 3.4 Parameters
applicable to Relevant Costs methodologies below. In particular, non-eligible
parameters must be excluded from the Relevant Costs calculation. In addition,
applicants must justify in detail the scope and computation of the revenues and costs
in their Business Plan, own detailed financial model and Application Form Part B.
All these documents are mandatory and will form an integral part of the application.
3.2 The Reference plant methodology [Option 2]
The methodology derives the Relevant Costs from the difference in CAPEX, Net Present
Value (NPV) of the OPEX, maintenance CAPEX, Revenues and Operational Benefits
arising during construction and over the first ten years of operation after the project’s
entry into operation between the Project and the Reference Plant:
Relevant Costs = IF Project CAPEX – Reference Plant CAPEX + (PV of IF Project
OPEX and Maintenance CAPEX – PV of Reference Plant OPEX and Maintenance
CAPEX) – (PV IF Project Operational Benefits – PV of Reference Plant Operational
Benefits) – (PV of IF Project Revenues – PV of Reference Plant Revenues)
3 The glossary of the call text defines entry into operation as “The moment in the project development cycle
where all elements and systems required for operation of the project have been tested and activities resulting
in effective avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions have commenced. For projects with multiple phases
(meaning several entry into operation dates in connection with implementation of successive phases, for
example for manufacturing projects), the entry into operation is defined as the entry into operation of the
last phase of the project.”
7EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
See Glossary in Appendix 1 for the definition of CAPEX, OPEX, Maintenance CAPEX,
Operational Benefits and Revenues.
The PV (and hence the NPV) for the Reference Plant should be computed using a WACC
that will be different than the one for the Project (see sections 3.2.1 and 3.4.4 below
for more details).
Any additional revenues of the Project (for example in the form of monetisation of the
by-products value(s)) or cost savings also need to be included in the calculation.
Applicants should pay attention to the parameters described in section 3.4 “Parameters
applicable to Relevant Cost methodologies” below. In particular, non-eligible
parameters must be excluded from the Relevant Costs calculation. In addition,
applicants must justify in detail the scope and computation of the revenues and costs
in the Project’s Business Plan, Application Form Part B, Reference Plant documents, and
applicant’s own detailed financial model, which should include all computation details
for both the Project and the Reference Plant. All these documents are mandatory and
will form an integral part of the application.
3.2.1 WACC to be used in the Reference plant methodology
In addition to the conditions governing the selection of the Reference Plant described
in section 2.1.2, applicants need to make specific assumptions with respect to the
WACC for the Reference Plant to enable a robust calculation of Relevant Costs under
the Reference plant methodology.
WACC for the (innovative) Project: Project WACC should follow the guidelines laid down
in section 3.4.4.
WACC for the Reference Plant: same guidelines as for Project WACC except for the
following:
• For cost of debt, applicants should use levels generally assumed for the sector;
and,
• For cost of equity, applicants should remove any “Innovation Premium” assumed
in the calculation of the cost of equity for the (proposed innovative) Project;
• For the leverage, applicants should use the same gearing ratio as for the Project.
3.3 “Detailed budget table / Relevant Costs calculator / Financial
Information File (FIF) template” to calculate Relevant Costs
The Relevant Costs are calculated automatically once the appropriate cells in the
“detailed budget table/Relevant Costs calculator/Financial Information File (FIF)” Excel
file are filled out.
This template is available via the “Funding and Tenders Portal” and its use is mandatory
for all applicants. Changes to the formulas or sheets of the FIF are not allowed.
The FIF contains amongst others the following information:
(1) “Financial Model Summary Sheet” including a summary overview of the financial
projections including revenues, OPEX and CAPEX, as well as key elements of the Profit
& Loss Account, balance sheet and cash flow statements. If a Project anticipates to
generate OPEX savings during operation (for example lower fuel or heat consumption),
these should be appropriately reflected in the projections. Applicants shall provide the
financial projections over the entire Project lifetime to ensure that the project’s
profitability is computed over the whole lifetime of the Project;
8EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
(2) Funding sources and uses table in the “Summary Chart” sheet with the financing
plan of the Project’s total CAPEX (eligible and ineligible items) expected at Financial
Close;
(3) table in the “Grant Breakdown Inputs” sheet with Innovation Fund grant breakdown
per work package and beneficiary/affiliated entity;
(4) “RC Calculation” sheet including the details of the Relevant Costs calculation based
on the selected Relevant Costs methodology. Applicants are instructed to copy the
values of the Relevant Costs and requested Innovation Fund grant amount rounded to
the nearest euro as shown at the bottom of the Sheet into the Application Form Part A;
(5) cost efficiency calculation in the “Cost Efficiency Calculation” sheet; and
(6) “Part C Support Sheet” as a support for manually entering the corresponding
data/indicators in the Application Form Part C.
The FIF calculates the Relevant Costs over the first 10 years of the Project’s operation.
If the entry into operation date does not coincide with the start of a particular calendar
year, the FIF will automatically take the pro rata share of Revenues, OPEX, Maintenance
CAPEX and Operational benefits for the calendar year corresponding to the 10th year
of operation for the calculation of the Relevant Costs.
3.4 Parameters applicable to Relevant Cost methodologies
Applicants must pay attention to the following parameters as further detailed below to
enable a robust calculation of Relevant Costs:
− Project boundaries and contingencies;
− Maritime and Aviation transport sectors;
− Financial projections (including revenues, CAPEX, maintenance CAPEX and
OPEX);
− Project WACC (discount rate);
− Carbon price and EU ETS allowances;
− Indexation/inflation;
− By-products and savings;
− Decommissioning costs;
− Parameters excluded from Relevant Costs calculation.
As indicated in the Business Plan template, explain the assumptions made on expected
revenues, CAPEX, and OPEX breakdowns used for the financial projections of the FIF
and your own financial model. In addition, justify your assumptions on volumes and
prices from potential offtakers, suppliers, and construction contractors, and make
precise references to the documents submitted in the “Project contract terms” annexes
(cf. section 5 of the call text) that provide the basis for these assumptions.
3.4.1 Project boundaries and contingencies
Intermediary products
All Projects will have an identifiable product or more (final or intermediary) products
which are the output of the Project (the valorization of captured CO2 is also an output).
All CAPEX, OPEX, revenues and operational benefits taken into account in the project’s
9EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
financial model and business plan must be linked to this product/these products. If the
product uses intermediary products or goods produced by installations which are not
part of the investment items, then only their purchase price can be taken into account
as Project costs.
Incremental / add-on projects
When a Project relates to building or transforming part of an existing installation, only
the CAPEX of this part may be taken into account for the Relevant Costs calculations.
Only the contribution of this partial process/installation to the overall operational cost
of the full process/installation may be used in the calculations. The revenues that can
be used are the ones generated by the incremental investment, not those of the overall
existing process and the logic applied must be the same as the one used for the
calculation of GHG emissions (i.e. capturing what has changed with the proposed
Project).
For example, for a carbon capture Project, applicants must use as input for the FIF the
CAPEX of the capture Project, its dedicated operational cost (including Maintenance
CAPEX as specified above) and the Project revenues as well as potential savings related
to the carbon capture Project (such as avoided purchase of EU ETS allowances (EUA),
sale of excess of free EUA, and any green premium for the base product of the
existing plant to which the capture unit is added).
Incremental Projects may be expected to have low profitability and/or negative
operational cash flows when considered in isolation, but the overall process/installation
with the integrated Project included could still be financially viable. Applicants should
in this case add in their own detailed financial model financial projections demonstrating
the aggregated impact of the innovative Project on the existing installation, by inserting
separate sheets with the detailed computations.
If the proposal is expected to have low profitability, confirmation of funding support
from the Project shareholders even in the presence of low/negative Net Present Value,
and for this funding support to cover both the construction costs and any negative
operational cash flows, is considered essential. Furthermore, a clear explanation of the
Project’s legal ownership structure and demonstration of the ability of the applicant
and/or shareholders to inject the required equity will be important aspects for the
evaluation of the financial maturity criterion.
Contingencies
Applicants are allowed to include contingencies in their CAPEX and OPEX. However,
robust justification will be required from applicants as to why these contingencies are
required, why they are at the level proposed, and how they will be allocated. This
justification can be presented in the form of a deterministic calculation supported by a
benchmark or previous experience which must be referenced, or a probabilistic
calculation which must be accompanied by a summary of the calculation method. The
soundness of this justification will be taken into account in the evaluation of the
Project’s financial maturity.
3.4.2 Maritime and Aviation transport sectors
Installation of innovative technology into a new or retrofitted ship/plane
Eligible activities for maritime and aviation projects are described in the call text.
The examples below provide guidance for projects related to the production and/or
installation of innovative technology (e.g. energy system, engine or equipment) into a
new or retrofitted ship or plane.
10EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
Example 1: manufacturing and installation of an energy-efficient engine on a newbuild
vessel where construction of the newbuild vessel falls outside the Project’s scope
Applicants must provide sufficiently detailed information in their application (for
example in the form of indicative contracts/heads of terms) to justify the scope and
estimated costs related to the part of the innovative technology which is built and
installed on the vessel.
For the Relevant Costs calculation, applicants shall use the No Reference plant
methodology and consider as the Innovation Fund Project the incremental CAPEX,
revenue and OPEX associated with the installation of the new equipment/system
technology on the newbuilt ship.
The CAPEX, OPEX, savings and revenues for the Relevant Costs calculation shall remain
within the following boundaries: the CAPEX of producing and installing the innovative
technology; the OPEX for operating the innovative technology; and revenues and
savings proven to be directly derived solely from the new technology.
In this specific example, applicants will use as input for the FIF: the CAPEX for the
engineering, manufacturing and installation of the engine (where relevant), the OPEX
linked to the engine’s operation (for example fuel costs and maintenance service costs),
and revenues directly related to the engine installation (such as avoided purchase of
EU ETS allowances or the potential green premium paid by customers for operating the
vessel with the new technology). However, in this specific example, any CAPEX related
to the construction of the newbuild vessel, or revenues (such as charter income), or
OPEX (for example crewing, insurance, port or dry docking costs) from operation of the
vessel with no direct link to the operation of the engine must be excluded from the
Relevant Costs calculation since they are falling outside of the Project scope.
Example 2: construction of a manufacturing plant of engines for small and medium-
sized vessels
For the Relevant Costs calculation, the Project scope is limited to the manufacturing of
engines.
In this specific example, applicants will use as input for the FIF: the CAPEX associated
with the plant construction and equipment; revenues from the sale of engines to
customers and OPEX for the operation the plant such as material, components, power
and labor costs.
Ship/plane lease financing
Finance leases are widely used for the financing of newbuilt ships or planes. Applicants
are allowed to include financial lease expenses as OPEX in the Relevant Costs
calculation in connection with the financing of newbuilt ships or planes. They must
clearly identify the company providing the financing (the lessor) and submit indicative
contract terms to justify the assumed length, schedule and expected payments of the
lease. The purchase option price upon termination of the lease can be included in the
financial projections, if there is a reasonable certainty that it will be exercised and
provided that the price is backed by the terms of an indicative lease contract. Applicants
shall provide the financial projections in connection with the lease financing over the
entire Project lifetime to ensure that the project’s profitability is computed over the
whole lifetime of the Project. However, for the Relevant Costs, the FIF will automatically
include the payments associated with the lease contract in the calculation only to the
extent that they arise within the first ten years of the Project’s operations.
11EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
The ability of the lessor to reach Final Investment Decision for the constructed ship or
plane and for the lease agreement to be secured by Financial Close, will be important
aspects for the evaluation of the financial maturity criterion.
3.4.3 Financial projections
Key data inputs are based on financial projections which applicants are required to
provide when filling in the FIF.
In addition, applicants are required to provide their own detailed financial model
(mandatory) which should include all detailed financial assumptions - derived among
others from feasibility studies, preliminary contract terms, market analysis and other
evidence based on the status of the Project to date - as well as Project financial
statements, return computation, and sensitivity analysis. The projections of the
applicant’s own detailed financial model must be consistent with those used in the FIF
to derive the calculation of Relevant Costs. For this purpose, applicants can add and
merge sheets of their ‘detailed financial model’ sheets to the FIF. Applicants must
still submit the FIF and detailed financial model as two distinct mandatory
documents.
If the applicants chose the Reference plant methodology, they should add in their own
detailed financial model the same type of information for the Reference Plant as for the
innovative Project, by inserting separate sheets with the detailed computations.
Applicants must include in the FIF the costs, savings and revenues generated by the
Project. See glossary in Appendix 1 for a definition of Project costs, savings and
revenues. The financing plan must cover all the Project costs. Non-eligible CAPEX and
OPEX, which are excluded from the Relevant Costs calculation, should be clearly
identified and encoded in the appropriate cells in the FIF.
Expansion CAPEX incurred after the defined date for entry into operation must not be
included in the financial projections of the FIF, as they are considered outside the scope
of the Innovation Fund Project.
The details of which elements of CAPEX are eligible for the calculation of the Relevant
Costs can be found in the Glossary of this document and in the sheet “Intro &
definitions” of the FIF.
Applicants must separate Maintenance CAPEX from CAPEX in their financial model. For
the purposes of the Relevant Costs calculation, Maintenance CAPEX must be solely
related to maintaining the Project’s operational capacity and can only be incurred after
the Project’s entry into operation and are discounted alongside OPEX.
Only expenses incurred after grant signature (or exceptionally for duly justified reasons
after the first day of the month following the proposal submission date) are eligible for
the calculation of the Relevant Costs (please refer to article 10 of the Call for proposals).
Therefore, any expenses incurred before grant signature (or exceptionally for duly
justified reasons before the first day of the month following the proposal submission
date), must be included in the “Financial Model Summary Inputs” sheet of the FIF as
“CAPEX items not included in the Relevant Costs (if relevant)”. This is to ensure that
costs incurred before the proposal’s submission do not impact the Relevant Costs
calculation.
CAPEX taken into account in the Relevant Costs calculations should therefore include
costs incurred or to be incurred before the Project’s entry into operation and should be
connected with the development and construction of the Project.
12EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
For projects with multiple phases (meaning several “entry into operation” dates linked
to successive phases, for example for manufacturing projects), the entry into operation
will consequently be the entry into operation of the last phase of the Project.
This means that any CAPEX projected after entry into operation should not be intended
to further expand the Project’s activities and production capacity. Only Maintenance
CAPEX (i.e. CAPEX in connection with replacement of key equipment implementation
of periodic system updates, or other significant one-off purchases that are likely to
occur periodically throughout the Project lifetime) should be included in the calculation
separately after the project entry into operation. In the Relevant Costs calculation,
Maintenance CAPEX is discounted alongside OPEX.
3.4.4 Project WACC
The minimum required project return from investors is represented through the
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of the project. This is the blended cost of
capital of the Project depending on the ratio of equity and debt expected to be secured
at financial close to finance the Project CAPEX. It is calculated using the following
formula:
WACC = E/V * Re + D/V*Rd * (1-Td)4
• Re = cost of equity
• Rd = cost of debt
• E/V = equity portion of total capital (Equity over total Value) to fund Project
CAPEX, as expected at financial close5, and which must exclude public funding
sources
• D/V = debt portion of total capital (Debt over total Value) to fund Project CAPEX,
as expected at financial close
• Td = marginal tax rate prevailing in the country of the Project
The WACC is applied to discount future income and cost streams over the Project
lifetime to make them comparable. The WACC is an important mechanism to help reflect
overall “project risks”. The WACC level also underpins the assessment of project
profitability by external evaluators and must therefore be realistic. For example, using
a very low WACC level - more in line with a company WACC - for a high-risk project is
likely to be challenged by evaluators.
To ensure equal treatment between projects, applicants must follow the methodology
provided in this section to derive the Project WACC and are not allowed to use their
own corporate or company WACC.
4 This is a nominal discount rate calculation (cost of debt and cost of equity already take into account
inflation).
5 Applicants need to present their projected capital structure at financial close (i.e. as agreed by the project
funders), in line with the financial information provided in the “Financial Model Summary Inputs” sheet.
13EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
Table 1. Main parameters and instructions to calculate the Project WACC
Item Definition
Cost of equity (Re) Re = Rf + (β * ERP) + IP, where
Rf = risk free rate
β = beta of the project
ERP = Equity risk premium6
IP = Innovation Premium
Risk-Free Rate (Rf) Risk-Free Rate is the theoretical interest rate that a zero-risk investment will achieve.
Applicants are required to select a value from the Table 3 in Appendix 2. This value
corresponds to the monthly average over the last ten years of the ten-year Government
bond rate of the country where the Project will be implemented.
Equity Risk Premium (ERP) Equity risk premium is by default 6%7 and reflects European ERP. If applicants wish to
use, instead, an ERP value as set out in Table 3 in Appendix 2, they must explain their
choice in the Business Plan when detailing the assumptions of the WACC.8
Beta (β) Beta value is by default 1. This value is also compulsory for the following sectors:
manufacturing, sustainable aviation fuel, energy storage and any other sector not listed
in Table 2 in Appendix 2. For the sectors listed in Table 2, applicants can use the beta
value listed in that Table , if they explain their choice in the Business Plan when detailing
the assumptions of the WACC9.
Innovation premium (IP) Applicants should take into consideration a further equity premium to reflect the risks
associated with highly innovative projects, leading to minimum Project returns that go
beyond the conventional sector WACC.
For transparency across applicants, a notional “Innovation Premium” of 3% should be
applied as a default value. Applicants are free to increase or decrease this level, with
justification - however the upper bound is 4% and the lower bound is 2%.
To the extent possible, applicants should quantify the perceived risks and use this to
justify any deviation from the default “Innovation Premium”.
Cost of debt Rd = base rate + credit spread
Base Rate Applicants should use swap rates consistent with the average maturity of the Project
debt. Please take into account that, even if swap rates can be negative, banks will not
lend money at negative rates, as most credit facility agreements will contain a ‘zero floor’
which provides that, if the base rate is negative, it is deemed to be zero for the purposes
of calculating interest under the agreement.
Credit Spread The margin should be based on terms expected by debt providers and justified by the
Project risks, projected cash flows and in line with loan/debt market standards.
Applicants should provide appropriate documentation for their chosen cost of debt.
If a reference is not available for the particular technology, a premium over an
established technology debt margin can be used and should be justified.
6 Additional return over the risk-free rate requested by investors to invest in the stock market.
7 Kroll (ex Duff & Phelps), June 8, 2023
8 Unjustified choice of ERP may be penalized during the evaluation and may lead to a lower score for the
quality of the cost efficiency ratio
9 Unjustified choice of Beta may be penalized during the evaluation and may lead to a lower score for the
quality of the cost efficiency ratio
14EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
Other elements of WACC
Value of capital (V) Total value of capital (equity plus debt). This does not include any EU or State aid used
in the Project financing plan.
Debt portion of total capital Applicants should take the D/V ratio (i.e. proportion of debt relative to the sum of equity
(D/V) and debt injected to finance the Project CAPEX) they contemplate and expect to be
achievable for the Project at the Financial close as implied by their projected financing
plan and reflected in their “Financial Model Summary Input Sheet”.
If the Project is carried out at applicant level and is financed directly from the balance
sheet of the applicant legal entity, the corporate debt should be treated as debt in the
D/V ratio. If the financing plan envisages to raise debt, equity or equity linked instruments
at parent company level and inject it into a distinct Project legal entity, or to raise debt
at Project level with a mother company/corporate guarantee or use inter-company debt
or bridge loan to equity, this has to be treated as equity, not as debt in the D/V ratio.
Applicants should not add any grant to the numerator of this D/V ratio.
Equity portion of total Financing sources provided by existing shareholders or external equity investors
capital (E/V) including shareholder loans or other equity-like instruments should be treated as equity.
Applicants should not add any grant to the numerator of this E/V ratio.
3.4.5 Carbon price and EU ETS allowances
Projects in sectors regulated by the EU ETS Directive that reduce their GHG emissions
will, in most cases, benefit from revenues from the sale of the free allocation of EU ETS
allowances that they will receive and do not need to surrender because of the reduced
emissions below the applicable benchmark(s). Revenues from the sale of excess CO2
emission allowances need to be included in the “Financial Model Summary Inputs” sheet
of the FIF and will be treated as Operational Benefits in the Relevant Costs calculation.
Applicants should assume carbon prices as they consider appropriate over the entire
Project lifetime, explaining why they have chosen to follow this approach in the
Application Form and/or Business Plan. The carbon price projected over time must be
consistently stated in the FIF.
While installations could theoretically hold onto the excess allowances for sale later, for
the purposes of the Relevant Costs calculation, the excess allowances are assumed to
be sold in the year received. Similarly, applicants should include as OPEX savings of
the Project any savings made from the need to buy a smaller amount of EU ETS
allowances due to the lower emissions of the proposed Project.
If, in addition, applicants are expecting to generate revenues from the sale of CO2 as
a final product or by-product for commercial use, irrespective of whether this will lead
to saved EU ETS allowances or not, these revenues should also be included as
operational benefits.
Finally, if applicants are expecting to generate revenues from the sale of carbon
removal certificates, these revenues should also be included as operational benefits.
3.4.6 Indexation/inflation
Indexation refers to the adjustment of OPEX, sale price to the forecast inflation over
the Project lifetime. Applicants are free to provide their best estimates of indexed OPEX
and sales price, including inflation, with a clear breakdown of the different components
and justification for the assumptions used for inflation.
15EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
3.4.7 By-products and savings
If the Project anticipates to generate additional revenues by selling by-products (such
as heat or biochar) or services (for instance, waste gate fees) derived from the
innovative production process, the corresponding value generated should be considered
as a “revenues from by-products" in the “Financial Model Summary Inputs” sheet of
the FIF.
If the production process will reduce costs through more efficient use of energy/heat
for example, the corresponding value of cost savings should be encoded as “OPEX
savings” in the “Financial Model Summary Inputs” sheet of the FIF and will have the
effect of reducing OPEX in the Relevant Costs calculation.
3.4.8 Decommissioning costs
If decommissioning costs of the assets of the Project arise during the first 10-year
period, they may be taken into account as part of the Relevant Costs calculation. Cost
estimates will vary from project to project and therefore need to be accurately
accounted for in the calculation. Applicants will have to justify both the presence and
the amount of these costs.
3.4.9 Parameters excluded from Relevant Costs calculation
The two Relevant Costs methodologies derive the Relevant Costs from the best estimate
of the CAPEX and the Net Present Value of Revenues, OPEX, Maintenance Capex and
Operational Benefits arising over the first ten years of operation. These terms are
defined in the glossary of this guidance.
Any other components should be excluded from the Relevant Costs calculation.
Examples of such excluded components are presented in the list below. This list of
examples should be considered as non-exhaustive.
- Public support
Additional public support can take the form of support from other EU funding
programmes or State aid. In terms of State aid, applicants must include in the
numerator of the cost efficiency ratio any State aid (for example in the form of
grants, contracts for difference, and feed-in tariffs) they have received,
requested or are planning to request and if they have been included in the
applicant’s financial model and the FIF. Any aforementioned public support
which has already been secured must always be included in the detailed financial
model and the FIF, provided that the funding is in connection with costs incurred
after the first day of the month following the proposal submission date. Public
support during the operational period should also be included in the financial
model and FIF (as “other OPEX subsidies” in the “Financial Model Summary
Inputs” sheet) on a non-discounted basis. These aforementioned forms of State
aid are excluded from the Relevant Costs computation.
As opposed to this, State aid provided in the form of fiscal or parafiscal measures
or tariff reduction (for example, exemption of payment of levy/tax on power
prices) will not be included in the numerator of the cost efficiency ratio but
should be included in the projections of the financial model and may also impact
the Relevant Costs computation. Applicants should describe clearly and in detail
in the Business Plan how these State aid measures are taken into account in
their cost assumptions.
16EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
- Terminal value
Terminal value of assets must not be taken into account in the Relevant Costs
calculation. The exclusion of terminal value is consistent with the fact that the
Project IRR is computed over the Project lifetime.
- Write-off of existing (old) assets or technologies
It is recognized that some applicants may have to replace old technology that is
not fully depreciated. For the purposes of calculating the Relevant Costs and
regardless of the Relevant Costs methodology selected, any write-off cost
associated with the replacement of existing technologies should be excluded.
Similarly, costs linked to accelerated depreciation of stranded assets (e.g.
depleted fields), decommissioning of existing assets, reallocation of existing
buildings, cleaning of used sites to be used for the project, are not eligible.
- Costs incurred before submission of the application
As stated in section 3.4.3 Financial projections, only costs incurred after grant
signature or exceptionally for duly justified reasons after the first day of the
month following the proposal submission date are eligible for the calculation of
the Relevant Costs (please refer to article 10 of the Call for proposals). Any
expenses incurred before the first day of the month following the proposal
submission date must be included in the “Financial Model Summary Inputs”
sheet of the FIF as “CAPEX items not included in the Relevant Costs (if relevant)”
to ensure that they are not included in the Relevant Costs calculation.
Costs are considered as incurred on a certain date if on that date they have
already been paid or if the obligation to pay has been established on or before
that date.
In other words, costs linked to a contract concluded before the proposal
submission date can be considered eligible for the Relevant Costs computation
if all the following conditions are met:
- they are linked to services to be performed /equipment delivered after
that date,
- they relate to invoices issued after that date, and
- the corresponding payments are made after that date
- Debt financing-related Costs
Costs linked to the debt financing of the Project are not eligible and must be
excluded from the Relevant Costs computation. A non-exhaustive list of such
costs is the following: interest during construction, working capital needs, bank
fees, legal fees, upfront fees, commitment fees, interest payments, additions to
the maintenance reserve account or debt service reserve account.
- Other excluded items
Operational leases, VAT, taxes, royalties paid to Project shareholders,
communication and marketing costs of other products, or reorganization costs
are also excluded from the Relevant Costs computation.

(c) Development costs
(d) Intangible assets
(e) Contingencies
(For each area of capital expenditure, please see individual term definitions
for their full meanings)
Construction costs All costs and expenses incurred in connection with design, engineering,
procurement, construction, commissioning and testing of the Project
including exclusively:
(i) costs of employees arising directly from the construction or
the acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment;
(ii) costs of site preparation;

(iv) personnel costs;
(v) professional fees and fees for environmental permits.
Development costs must not include costs or expenses which are not directly
linked to the development of the project’s activities.
Financial Close The point in time in the Project development cycle where all the Project and
financing agreements have been signed and all the required conditions
contained in them have been met. Financial close may not be confused with
the Final Investment Decision which is only one of the steps required for
reaching the stage of Financial Close.
Financial lease Financial product in which a leasing company (‘lessor’) gives operating
control of an asset to a business (‘lessee’) for an agreed period against
periodic lease payments, and typically at the end of the contract, the lessee
will have a purchase option to become the owner of the asset.
Contractually, the lessor remains the legal owner of the asset throughout the
lease period, but the lessee takes responsibility for all the risks and rewards
associated with the ownership of the asset.
Intangible assets Non-physical assets that hold a certain value. These include patents,
trademarks, copyrights and Intellectual Property rights (IPR) that are related
to the Project and purchased by the Project.
The acquisition of intangible assets from a third party for the purposes of its
use by the Project can be capitalized and included in the Intangible assets
under the following conditions:
(i) the Intangible assets must be a pre-requisite for the
implementation of the Project. Intangible assets that are only
an option for possible future use by the Project may not be
included;
(ii) The valuation of the Intangible asset must be established in
accordance with applicable valuation rules and be
proportionate to the level of development of these
intangible assets;
(iii) Both the relevance of the intangible assets for the Project
and their valuation should be verified by an independent
expert;
(iv) under no condition can a member of the Project consortium
sell intangible assets at a profit to one of the companies in
the Project benefiting from the Innovation Fund.
All costs necessary to maintain the Project’s operational capacity. For
Maintenance CAPEX
instance, costs related to the replacement of key equipment or the
implementation of periodic system updates. Capital expenditures intended
to expand the Project’s activities and/or increase production volumes should
not be included as maintenance CAPEX. Any expansion CAPEX foreseen to
increase production volumes after the defined entry into operation is
19EU Grants: InnovFund Relevant costs methodology: V4.0 – 15.11.2024
considered to fall outside the scope of the proposed Innovation Fund Project
and should be excluded from the FIF.
(OPEX) Savings All savings generated by the substitution of the existing technology with the
proposed project.
Operational Benefits Any revenue received by the Project from
• the sale of EU ETS allowances for reductions in CO2 emissions
• the sale of CO2 as a final product or by-product for commercial use
• the monetization of the value added/certificates from reductions in
GHG emissions not already captured elsewhere in the revenues or cost
savings
Operational Expenditures (OPEX) All costs related to the following categories:
− Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of a project, including,
where applicable, any feedstock costs such as costs of fuel.
− Decommissioning costs, provided they occur in the first ten years
after entry into operation of a project.
− Financial lease costs
− R&D cost provided that these are needed to keep the innovation
competitive. This necessity should be duly justified.
Important! Depreciation and amortization costs are not considered as OPEX!
For full transparency, applicants must provide a detailed breakdown and
justification of the OPEX.
Project All activities related to the implementation of a project for which support
from the Innovation Fund is requested or provided.
Project costs All costs carried by the entities benefiting from the Innovation Fund grant
that are necessary to implement the Project.

1. Introduction
In order to receive EU funding/tenders (i.e. grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc), applicants need to fulfill a certain number of conditions
which must be checked before any funding can be awarded to them.
Some of these checks are done centrally by the EU Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register, set up in accordance with
Articles 128 and 147 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/10461 as central repository
and electronic data interchange area for participants.
This guidance sets out the rules that the Central Validation Service will use for these
checks. They currently cover:
− legal entity validation (also called ‘PIC validation’)
− LEAR appointment
− collecting the financial information for the financial capacity assessment (also
called ‘FCA’)
− ownership control assessment (also called ‘OCA’).
For these checks, the participants will be contacted directly by the Central Validation
Service and asked to submit the necessary information and supporting documents via
the Participant Register. This happens normally during preparation of the first grant,
procurement, prize or contribution agreement that successfully passed the evaluation
stage, but can also occur later during subsequent applications or in case of changes.
All data and documents will be treated as confidential.
Personal data will be handled in accordance with Regulation 2018/17252 to ensure
compliance with the principles of transparency, proportionality, impartiality and
legality. For the details, please refer to the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy
Statement (available on Portal > Legal Notices).
2. Legal entity validation
2.1. Legal entity validation and specific legal statuses: Criteria and
conditions
One of the main tasks of the Central Validation Service is the validation of new legal
entities applying for EU grants, procurements, prizes and contribution agreements.
Legal entity validation is a requirement under the Financial Regulation. It serves to
ensure that only verified entities can enter into financial relations with the EU and to
avoid legally invalid contracts.
Legal entity validation is needed only once, to get the legal entity information and
1 Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on
the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No
1296/2013, (EU) No 1301/2013, (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1304/2013, (EU) No 1309/2013, (EU) No
1316/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No 283/2014, and Decision No 541/2014/EU and repealing
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1).
2 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions,
bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No
45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
participant identification code (PIC) validated. Once validated, the participants can
enter into financial relations with the EU and use the PIC for all EU actions managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. The PIC will be valid for all ongoing application
procedures and signature in the system, but also for any type of EU funding in the
future — without having to re-register or be re-validated.
This is why the standards for PIC validation are applied consistently, independently of
the specific call/application/tender procedure that triggers the validation. The same
criteria and checks are applied for grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc, as well as for low and high value contracts.
The validation comprises two distinct actions: (a) the verification that the participant
exists as legal entity capable of entering into financial relations with the EU, including
correctness of the participant’s legal data (legal form, address, etc) and (b) the
verification of certain specific legal statuses that are used in EU funding programmes
and recorded centrally in the Participant Register.
2.1.1 Legal entity validation
‘Legal entity’ means a natural person or an entity created and recognised by law as a
legal person. It must have legal personality and, acting on its own account and in its
own name, be able to exercise rights and be subject to obligations.
Specific cases
❖ Natural persons (including self-employed persons; see below) — Are by default
considered as being legal entities. However, the Central Validation Service will refuse
validation of persons that cannot legally enter into contractual relations with the EU
(e.g. persons under age).
❖ Branches — Are not regarded as legal entities, since they do not have legal
personality distinct from that of their mother-company. The fact that they are
registered in national official registers is not relevant. It will be their mother-company
that will be considered as legal entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in
the Participant Register. The same applies to branches established in a different
country or branches of entities such as non-profit organisations, NGOs, etc.
❖ Foreign companies (company establishments which are registered with a special
status in the official register, e.g. ‘société de droit étranger’) — Will not be regarded
as legal entities, since they do not have legal personality distinct from that of their
mother-company. It will be their mother-company that will be considered as legal
entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register (the
one registered in the country of incorporation).
❖ Entities set-up within (or under) a parent organisation (such as
departments/centers/offices, without legal personality, despite having administrative
or budgetary autonomy, own VAT number/fiscal code/number of registration, etc) —
Cannot be regarded as legal entities and are considered as belonging to their parent-
organisation. It will be their parent organisation that will be considered as legal entity
for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register.
2.1.2 Exception: Validation of private entities without legal personality
By way of exception, the Financial Regulation allows for certain ‘entities without legal
personality’ to be eligible for EU grants. Such entities can therefore be validated in
the Participant Register, provided they meet the conditions set out in Article
197(2)(c) of this Regulation:
7EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on behalf
of the entity
and
− the entity offers equivalent guarantees for the protection of the EU financial
interests as a legal person, in particular equivalent financial and operational
capacity (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
This exception aims at private entities, i.e. associations or similar entities with
permanent structures (secretariat, management board, assembly, etc.) that have
their own activities, but just lack formal legal personality.
Concerning the first condition, the entity must prove its representatives' capacity to
undertake legal obligations on its behalf. This condition is not met when the
obligations are assumed on behalf of the representatives themselves or on behalf of
the owner(s) of the entity.
Concerning the second condition, the entity must prove the following elements:
− existence of patrimony/assets/capital separated and different from those of its
members/owners
and
− rules ensuring that creditors can rely on such patrimony/assets/capital and
that, in case of liquidation/insolvency, creditors are reimbursed prior to the
repartition of the patrimony/assets/capital among the owners/members (—
both conditions must be fulfilled and proved by supporting documents).
This exception only applies for participation in EU grants; entities without legal
personality cannot participate in EU tenders.
2.1.3 Exception: Validation of ministries, specialised entities of IOs and
certain EU bodies
By way of exception, the Central Validation Service will also accept the following
public entities without legal personality to be validated in the Participant Register:
− the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) (explicitly declared eligible by Articles
176(2) and 197(4) of the Financial Regulation)
− ministries, executive services which are part of the public administration of a
(central or federated) State and directly linked to the government and other
services which are part of the legislative or judicial administration, in
accordance with the official organisation of the State
− assimilated international organisations referred to in Article 156(2) of the
Financial Regulation
− specialised entities set up by international organisations, that lack legal
personality
− Common Foreign Security Policy (CFSP) missions and EU special
representatives set up by the Council of the European Union.
Departments/directorates/units/offices and other entities set up within a Ministry (or
within an executive or other service) without legal personality are considered as part
of the same Ministry (or service) and cannot be considered as independent legal
8EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
entities (e.g. schools, libraries, etc). They will have to use the PIC of their parent
organisation to participate in EU grants, procurements, prizes, etc.
2.1.4 Specific legal statuses
In addition, the validation covers the following specific legal statuses that are used in
certain EU funding programmes:
− private entity or public body
− non-profit or for profit organisation
− small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
− middle-capitalisation enterprise (mid-cap)
− non-governmental organisation (NGO)
− civil society organisation (CSO)
− international organisation (IO)
− research organisation
− secondary or higher education establishment.
An entity may be categorised in more than one of these legal statuses (i.e. non-profit,
public body, research organisation, international organisation, etc.).
The practical relevance of these statuses (and what happens if they change) is
established at the level of the different funding programmes, and sometimes even at
the level of the call for proposals/call for tender.
Moreover, not all of these statuses are systematically checked and validated by the
Central Validation Service. Some of them are self-declarations or self-assessments.
This means that the participants are solely responsible for the correctness of the
information they provide (in the self-declaration/self-assessment).
The Central Validation Service may however — at any time — carry out checks on
self-declared/self-assessed statuses against supporting documents and ask for
clarifications.
In case of false declarations, the EU services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status(es)
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements,
etc.; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
Private entity or public body
'Private entity' means an entity established under private law.
‘Public body’ means an entity established as a public body by national law, or an
9EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
international organisation.
‘Established as a public body by national law’ means:
− incorporated as a public body in the act of creation or recognised as a public
body by national law
and
− governed by public law (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
Criteria such as:
− mission or activity in the general interest (public service mission)
− the fact that the shares are owned by a public body (even if ownership reaches
up to 100% of the share capital)
− public financing
− state supervision and control
do NOT constitute sufficient evidence to qualify an entity as a public body, if the
above two conditions are not met.
Public bodies may however act and be subject to private law for some or most of their
activities, provided that, concerning their existence and their functioning, they are
subject to public law.
The two statuses (private entity and public body) are mutually exclusive, meaning
that you can only be validated as one or the other.
They are systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the
Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Self-employed persons (persons who perform an activity independently and with
their own means, such as craftsmen and individuals exercising liberal, industrial and
commercial professions) — Are regarded as ‘natural persons’, not as ‘private entities’;
the business/profession/activity they perform is not provided with independent legal
personality different from that of the person.
❖ Private law bodies with a public service mission3 — A legal entity
incorporated under private law/private legal form is not considered to be a public
body even if owned by the State/other public bodies and/or pursuing a public service
mission.
Non-profit
‘Non-profit entity’ means an entity that is non-profit making by its legal form or legal
purpose (e.g. charitable organisations), or that has a legal or statutory obligation not
to distribute profits to its shareholders or members.
All profits have to be reinvested in the same activity of the entity.
3 Article 62(1)(c)(vi) of Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
10EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Decisions on (not) distributing profits made by the managing board, associates,
stakeholders, members, or representatives and/or practices adopted by the entity to
not distribute profits and/or the absence of profits achieved are not sufficient proof of
the non-profit nature. The obligation not to distribute profits and/or the impossibility
to distribute profits must be based on law and/or the act of establishment/articles of
association/statutes, etc.
Whether the owners/founders of the entity are non-profit and whether the profits are
allocated to non-profit (or for profit) entities is irrelevant.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Public bodies — Are in principle regarded as non-profit by default.
❖ Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) — The classification as ‘non-
governmental organisation (NGO)’ is not relevant for the non-profit status, since in
most countries NGO is not a recognized legal form. By contrast, non-profit status is a
prerequisite for the self-declaration as NGO (see below).
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
‘Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)’ means a micro, small or medium-sized
enterprise as defined in the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361, i.e.:
− engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form (including, in
particular, self-employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or
other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an
economic activity)
and
− employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as
defined in Article 5 of the SME Recommendation) and which have an annual
turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and/or an annual balance sheet total
not exceeding EUR 43 million.4
An entity is considered to be engaged in an ‘economic activity’, if it proves to be
involved in any form of trade or activity done for remuneration or pecuniary interest
on the market. Thus, in general, any activity consisting in (directly or indirectly)
offering goods or services on a given market is an economic activity.
The following will NOT be considered economic activities:
− activities which do not entail (directly or indirectly) some sort of pecuniary
offset or
− activities for which there is no given/direct (or indirect) market or
− activities for which the income generated is not distinct from the personal
income of the entity’s members or shareholders.
4 The SME ceilings must be calculated by including the headcount of staff, the balance sheet total and the
turnover data of all relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361.
11EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
This status is self-declared. For calls where the SME status has an impact on eligibility
or funding (higher funding rate, etc), participants must go through a self-assessment
wizard.
Two-year rule — In accordance with Article 4.2 of the SME Recommendation, the SME
status depends on the ceilings for two consecutive accounting periods. Headcount and
turnover must stay below the ceilings for two accounting periods to obtain the SME
status; conversely, the status will be lost if they rise above the ceilings for two
consecutive periods.
Since the SME self-assessment looks at the information for only one accounting
period (the last one), the SME self-assessment result may be flawed. Participants that
were below the ceiling the year before, must contact the Central Validation Service
via the Participant Register in order to request a formal validation. This validation will
then take into account the two accounting periods.
The two-year rule does not apply for changes due to a merger or acquisition.
Enterprises that are subject to a change in ownership need to be assessed on the
basis of their shareholder structure at the time of the transaction. If the aggregated
headcount and financial data of the new structure exceed the SME ceilings, the SME
status is lost immediately from the date of the transaction5.
Participants whose SME status changes after registration must update their data in
the Participant Register. This is important not only for eligibility checks in grant
applications, but also for statistical purposes.
Specific cases
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that do not yet have
closed accounts or companies without economic activity but expecting to enter
soon into the market — May also qualify as SMEs, as long as they are able to provide
a ‘bona fide estimate’ (in the form of a business plan) covering the period necessary
for the entity to generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long time-to market
— Are allowed to demonstrate that they are engaged in an economic activity by
showing the investments made and the likely expected return.
Middle-capitalisation enterprise (Mid-cap)
'Middle-capitalisation enterprise’ means an enterprise that is:
− not a micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under the EU SME
Recommendation 2003/361
and
− employing up to 3 000 persons6 , where the headcount of staff, including all
relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises, is calculated in
accordance with Article 3 to 6 of the Annex to the Recommendation.
This status is self-declared. For calls where the mid-cap status has an impact on
eligibility or funding (higher funding rate, etc.), participants must go through the SME
5 See Recital 9 of Recommendation No, 2003/361/EC and the User Guide to the SME Definition (p. 14).
6 Expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Annex of EU recommendation
2003/361.
12EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
self-assessment wizard to make sure that they do not fall under the definition of SME,
and then to self-declare that the number of employees does not exceed 3 000
persons.
Non-governmental organisation (NGO)
‘Non-governmental organisations’ are organisations which are voluntary, independent
from government and non-profit, and which are not a political party or trade union.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by private entities,
which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Civil society organisation (CSO)
‘Civil society organisations’ are organisations from the ‘third sector’ of society, distinct
from government and business (i.e. private for profit entities).
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will normally be accepted only by private
entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
International organisation (IO)
‘International organisation’ means an intergovernmental organisation (other than the
EU) established under international public law, including specialised entities — with or
without legal personality — set up by international organisations.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
For some EU funding programmes there are moreover specific subtypes of
international organisations:
− ‘international organisations of European interest for H2020 (H2020 IOEI)’, i.e.
international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member
States or H2020 associated countries and whose main objective is promoting
scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international European research organisations for Horizon Europe (HE IERO)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries and whose main
objective is promoting scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international organisations of European interest for Digital Europe (DEP IOEI)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or whose headquarters are in an EU Member State.
The H2020 IOEI subtype status is systematically checked against supporting
documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.
The HE IERO and DEP IOEI subtype statuses are self-declared. In the future, for calls
where the HE IERO and DEP IOEI statuses have an impact on eligibility or funding,
participants will also be asked to go through a self-assessment wizard.
Specific cases
❖ Entities set up as distinct bodies by an international organisation with a
special mission but which do not have explicit legal personality — Can be validated
as with legal personality, if they meet any of the following criteria:
− they have treaty-making capacity or
13EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− they have capacity to act at international level independently from the
organisation that set them up (i.e. capacity to undertake legal obligations).
If such entities do not meet one of the above criteria, they can exceptionally be
validated as without legal personality (see section 2.1.3 above).
Research organisation
‘Research organisation’ means an entity that:
− is established as non-profit organisation as described above
and
− carries out research and/or technological development as its main objective.
The following are NOT considered research activities:
− supporting or financing research activities carried out by other entities
− promoting, managing or coordinating research activities.
Only entities that have research and/or development as their main objective can
qualify as research organisations. By contrast, entities that have research and/or
development as ancillary activities (even if regular and substantial, e.g. in museums
or hospitals) do not qualify as ‘research organisations’.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by entities, which
have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Secondary or higher education establishment
‘Secondary or higher education establishment’ means an entity that is recognised as
such by its national education system and is able to deliver diplomas recognised by
the State.
It can be a public body or a private entity (see above). The national accreditation as a
secondary/higher education establishment is not sufficient to consider the entity as a
public body.
This status is self-declared.
2.2 Documents and information to provide
2.2.1 General requirements and principles
The legal validation of entities is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participants as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
by the participants on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (can be
required by the EU services at any time).
In principle only official documents are accepted. Documents are considered as official
when they are delivered by official national authorities. Official documents can NOT be
replaced by self-declarations or by sworn or solemn statements before judicial or
administrative authorities, notaries or public officers.
As a general rule, documents are accepted in any of the EU official languages.
Participants may however be requested to submit an English free (unofficial)
translation to facilitate the validation process. Documents in non-EU languages will be
accepted only if accompanied by a free translation in English (and in case of doubt, a
14EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
certified/legal translation in English may be requested). Free translations should
always be accompanied by the copies of the original official documents.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as for any information provided by other means
(e.g. by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
2.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Signed legal entity identification form7:
− Natural Person Form: in English
− Private Legal Entity Form: in English
− Public Legal Entity Form: in English.
2. Official VAT document or — if the entity is not registered for VAT — the proof of
VAT exemption, not older than one (1) year.
For the specific legal statuses, participants will be asked to submit the following
additional documents:
Status Documents to be submitted
Private entity A valid registration extract not older than one (1) year.
Documents older than one year may be accepted if valid for a
(including SME and mid-cap)
certain period of time expressly indicated in the same
document (e.g. valid for two years) and if submitted via the
Participant Register within this period of time.
Public body Copy of the act, law, decree or decision that established the
entity as a public body (or, if this does not exist, any other
official legal document that proves this).
Natural person Integral copy (legible) of valid identity card or passport (e.g. in
case of identity card, both sides must be provided).

Entities without legal personality Copy of an official document attesting that the representatives
of the entity have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on
its behalf.
Copy of an official document attesting that the entity has the
same operational and financial viability as that of a legal entity:
i.e.
1. a document showing patrimony/assets/capital that
are separated and different from those of the
members/owners of the entity, and
2. a copy of the rules providing that creditors can rely
on this patrimony/assets/capital and — in case of
liquidation/insolvency — are reimbursed before the
patrimony/assets/capital are divided between the

Non-profit Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is non-
profit by its legal form or by its legal purpose, or that it has a
legal or statutory obligation not to distribute profits to
shareholders or individual members.
The certificate of tax exemption is only an indication of the
non-profit status and will therefore be assessed together with
other elements.
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME) The following documents must be provided for the participant
and mid-caps and for its linked and partner entities (in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation

Sworn or solemn statements before a judicial or
administrative authority, notary or public officer cannot replace
the above listed documents as proof of the SME or mid-cap
status.
The following documents must be submitted in the below
specific cases:
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that
do not yet have closed accounts — Instead of approved
financial statements, a self-declaration must be provided,
including a bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan)
for the entire period (financial years) necessary for the entity to
generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long
time-to market — In addition to the approved financial
statements, a self-declaration must be provided, including a
bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan) for the
entire period (financial years) necessary to generate turnover,
including a declaration of the investment made and the likely
expected return (to demonstrate that, despite the lack of
turnover, the enterprise is engaged in an economic activity).
❖ Entities owned directly or indirectly by natural persons —
Self-declaration on the natural person(s) engagement in
economic activity and possible participations in other entities
must be provided. The template for the self-declaration will be
provided to participants during the validation process if specific
cases of ownership by natural persons are identified.

international public law.
Research organisation Copy of an official document attesting research or technological
development as the main objective of the entity.

Validation Service)
Secondary or higher education Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is
establishment recognised as ‘secondary or higher education establishment’ by
the national education system and is entitled to deliver
(— if expressly requested by the Central
diplomas recognized by the State.
Validation Service)
For other categories such as NGO, Civil Society Organisation, etc no supporting
documents are needed (unless exceptionally requested by the Central Validation
Service).
2.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
17EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− the documents submitted are outdated (e.g. VAT document or extract of
registration no longer valid or more than one (1) year old)
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the validation (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
2.3 Validation and effective date
On the basis of the submitted information and documents, the participant will be
validated with the effective date of entry into force of the legal act establishing its
constitution or incorporation (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
That date will be, in order of precedence:
1. the date of registration in the country's’official registry (e.g. commercial
registry)
2. the date of publication in the national official journal
3. the date of the legal deposit of the act in the court registry
4. the date of signature of the parties.
When there is no act of constitution or incorporation, the participant will be
considered to exist since a standard default date.
The effective date for the SME and mid-cap status will be the accounts closure date of
the accounting period on which the assessment is based in accordance with Article
4(2) of the Annex of the SME Recommendation 2003/361. For newly established
enterprises that do not yet have closed accounts, the effective date is the date of
their creation.
The effective date of other specific legal statuses is the date in which the specific
status enters into force. This date may be the same as its effective date of
constitution or incorporation (or may differ, if the specific status has been acquired
later on).
2.4 Modification of validations
Modifications in the validation can be made in the following cases:
− following a request submitted by the participant to update the validation (e.g.
in case of changes in the participant’s legal situation such as change of
identity/legal form, name, address, status) or
− after checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out by the EU services
which necessitate a correction.
2.4.1 Validation updates
In case of a change in the participant’s legal situation (identity/legal form, name,
address, status, etc), the participant must request an update of the validation.
18EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Requests to update a validation will be accepted, if submitted by the participant’s
LEAR and accompanied by the relevant supporting documents. If no LEAR has
been appointed yet in the Participant Register, requests for modification should be
submitted after the LEAR appointment has been validated.
The ‘effective date of the change’ will be the date on which the act establishing the
change enters into force (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
For SMEs and mid-caps, the effective date is the closure date of the accounting period
on which the change of status is based. For cases of mergers and acquisitions that
lead to the loss of the SME or mid-cap status, the effective date of change will be the
date when the ownership structure changed.
The impact and practical consequences of the changes depend on each funding
programme.
2.4.2 Corrections of validations
If a validation turns out to beincorrect (through an audit, ex-post check, investigation
or other means), it will be corrected by the Central Validation Service. The correction
will be registered with effect back to the effective date of the initial validation.
If the error is attributable to the Central Validation Service and its correction implies
disadvantages for the participant, the retroactive effect may exceptionally be waived,
if duly justified and in line with the principles of sound financial management and
proportionality.
If the error was the fault of the participant (intentional or unintentional), its
participation in on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc
may be terminated and undue amounts paid may be recovered. Moreover, the
participant may be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements,
prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial
Regulation). In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
2.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If they find out that a participant did not meet the criteria for being validated or for
being validated with a specific legal status (e.g. due to false declarations), the
modification of the validation will be registered with retroactive effect back to the
effective date of the validation.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc, their participation may be terminated/withdrawn and
undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.

3. Validation of the LEAR appointment
3.1 Validation of the LEAR appointment: General requirements and principles
In parallel with the legal entity validation, the Central Validation Service will contact
the participants to appoint their Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR), i.e.
the single point of contact needed for the Participant Register and Funding & Tenders
Portal electronic exchange system.
The appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register is mandatory for all
validated participants. Without LEAR it will NOT be possible to update the legal entity
data in the Participant Register, nor sign contracts electronically in the Funding &
Tenders Portal.
3.1.1 Role of the LEAR
The LEAR is the person officially appointed by the participant to handle their access
rights and key data in the Participant Register (legal and other data, certain access
rights in the electronic exchange system, etc.).
Once validated, it is the LEAR who is responsible for giving access rights to the Portal
electronic exchange system and who must ensure that the participant’s legal
information is always up to date.
The LEAR must enter and update on the ‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen the names
of the:
− legal representatives and signatories for the organisation (so-called ‘LSIGNs’);
these are people who are able to commit the organisation legally by signing
contracts and authorising amendments to them and
− persons that may sign cost statements on behalf of the organisation (so-called
‘FSIGNs’).
If needed, the LEARs can delegate their tasks to one or more colleagues, who will act
as account administrators (so-called ‘AccAds’; delegation also through the
‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen).
In case of changes, the LEAR must encode the change in the Participant Register and,
if needed, request validation and provide supporting documents.
For a detailed description of the LEAR rights and responsibilities, see the LEAR
appointment letter*.
3.1.2 Position of the LEAR
The LEAR is an administrative function that may be held by the participant’s legal
representative or another key person within the entity.
The LEAR must be someone employed in the entity (most commonly in the central
administrative services of the entity) and should be able to ensure the stability and
continuity that is needed to fulfil this role in order to honour the participant’s
contractual obligations.
Participants that are natural persons will automatically have the role of LEAR; in this
case the role cannot be attributed to a different person (but the LEAR can appoint an
account administrator).
20EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Each participant can only appoint one LEAR and must ensure to immediately replace
their LEAR in case they are no longer able to exercise the role (e.g. job change,
dismissal, death, etc; see section 3.3).
The participant assumes the full responsibility for the choice of the person they
appoint as LEAR.
3.1.3 Legal representative
The LEAR must be appointed by the participant’s legal representative. The legal
representative is a person duly authorised to act on behalf of the entity and to
commit it in its entirety vis-à-vis third parties.
Specific cases
❖ Persons tasked with the daily management — Can not be recognized as legal
representatives if they are not entitled to engage and represent the entity outside
ordinary day-to-day business matters.
The ‘daily management’ (‘gestion journalière’) is commonly understood as comprising
those acts that, because of their minor importance or the need for a prompt solution,
do not justify the intervention of the management bodies. It consists of ordinary
business and execution of day-to-day decisions and in line with the general
instructions of the management board.
❖ Limitations — Similarly, persons empowered to engage and commit the
participant only within certain limits (including financial limits) can not be accepted as
legal representatives for the purposes of the LEAR appointment.
3.1.4 Timing of the LEAR appointment
The process for appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register can run in parallel
to the validation of the entity, but can only be finalised once the participant (PIC) is
validated.
LEAR appointment is not a condition for the submission of a proposal/tender in the
Funding & Tenders Portal, but its validation must be completed before the the grant,
procurement or contribution agreement can be signed.
3.2 List of documents and information
For the validation of the LEAR appointment, the scanned version of the following
documents must be uploaded by the participant in the Participant Register:
1. LEAR appointment letter* (specifying the LEAR roles & duties and including the
declaration of consent to the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and
Conditions*), completed, dated and signed by the legal representative and the
LEAR
2. Integral copy of an official, valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport, with
photo and signature) of:
− the legal representative and
− the appointed representative (LEAR)
3. Document(s) proving that the legal representative(s) appointing the LEAR is
empowered as such, which must:
21EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− clearly indicate the role/function within the organisation as legal
representative
− identify and appoint this person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
The originals must be kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which
can be required by the EU services at any time). They must not be sent to the Central
Validation Service.
After receiving the above-listed documents (and after the PIC has been validated),
the LEAR appointment will be validated in the Participant Register.
For a detailed description of the LEAR appointment process, see the Online Manual*
and the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions*.
Proof of identity
‘Identity documents’ are those issued by national authorities and recognized by
national law as valid proof of identity. Identity documents can not be replaced by any
other means of proof. The EU services cannot waive this requirement under any
circumstances.
Examples of identity documents accepted are ID cards and passports. Driving licenses
are also accepted, as long as they are considered as valid proof of identity under the
applicable national law of the entity concerned.
Identity documents must be valid (not expired) at the time of the LEAR appointment.
An integral copy of the document must be provided (e.g. in most countries both sides
of the identity card must be provided).
Identity documents in which some parts/elements, including the photo, have been
deleted/erased/covered (e.g. with black marker) cannot be accepted.
Specific cases
❖ Service cards and badges issued by the participant — Cannot replace identity
documents (even if the participant is a public body) and therefore cannot be accepted
as proof of identity.
❖ Print-outs from the ID electronic chip — Cannot be accepted either.
Signatures
The LEAR documents must be signed by persons who are legal representatives of the
participant.
The names of both legal representative and LEAR in the LEAR documents must
correspond to those indicated in their official identity documents. LEAR documents
signed with acronyms/nick names/etc that do not correspond to the names indicated
in the identity documents will not be accepted.
Signatures can be either handwritten signatures or qualified electronic signatures
22EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
within the meaning of Article 3(12) of Regulation 910/20148. For the latter, the
Central Validation Service will verify that the signature is based on a valid qualified
certificate and was created by a secure creation device. See here for the list of
accepted trust service providers: eIDAS Dashboard (europa.eu).
Specific cases
❖ Internal requirements (e.g. joint signature of more than one person required to
legally engage the entity, foreseen by law, act of establishment, statutes, internal
rules, etc) — In case of internal requirements, the participant is fully responsible for
ensuring compliance (e.g. through an internal process ensuring that the single
signature on the LEAR documents is made only after all the internal requirements on
joint signature are fulfilled).
❖ Limitations — The Central Validation Service will take into account limitations to
represent the entity only if these limitations are explicitly mentioned in the
documents submitted to prove the empowerment of the legal representative (e.g.
limitation in the excerpts of the company registry).
Documents proving the empowerment of the legal representative
The document(s) proving the empowerment must identify:
− the role/function of legal representative within the entity
− the name and appointment of the person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
This can be found in a single document (in case the official appointment also specifies
the powers/tasks related to the appointment) or in several documents combined (e.g.
the official act of appointment and the organisational document, such as act of
establishment, statutes, articles of association, etc, in which the powers/tasks related
to the role are identified).
The documents must be valid (not expired) at the time when the LEAR is appointed.
The documents proving the appointment of the legal representative are those
required/accepted under the applicable national law of the entity concerned. They
may vary depending on the country, the legal form and status:
− law/decree/official act/official gazette in case of public entities
− copy of the treaty in case of international organisations
− decision of assembly, official documents from the council of administration,
executive committee or directors board, excerpts of the company registry in
case of private entities.
A declaration of honour can be accepted only in exceptional, duly justified cases
where none of the above exists.
Concerning the language of such documents and participant's responsibilities
concerning translations, see section 2.2.1.
8 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on
electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 257,
28.8.2014, p. 73).
23EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Specific cases
❖ Participants who are natural persons — Do not need to prove their
empowerment, but still need to send the supporting documents listed above. The
documents should be signed by the natural person alone. A copy of the ID documents
of the natural person must also be included.
❖ Deputising persons — In case of temporary absence of the legal
representative(s) or their impossibility to sign, other persons empowered to act as
legal representatives (i.e. deputising persons) are accepted as legal representatives
by default. The reason for the temporary absence/impossibility and the legitimation of
the deputy will not be checked by the Central Validation Service and therefore
remains under the full responsibility of the participant (see also above under ‘internal
requirements’).
❖ Ministries — For ministries, Ministers are considered legal representatives by
default and there is no need to provide the legal documents proving their
empowerment.
In addition to the Minister's role, the following roles/functions are considered as legal
representatives by default, without any further verification of the legal documents
proving their empowerment:
− Deputy Minister
− State/General Secretary and their deputies
− Directors of certain specific horizontal sectors/departments/directions, namely
'legal', 'financial','European or international relationships'.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the ministry, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website of the ministry).
Except if otherwise provided in the applicable rules (law/decree/act governing the
organisation of the ministry), other roles such as ‘Director’/‘Had of Department’/‘Head
of Unit’, etc will be considered as having limited tasks and powers (relating only to
the directorate/department/unit’s policies) and, therefore, not entitled to represent
and engage the ministry as a whole.
For Ministers, the ID document can be exceptionally replaced by a badge or service
card (issued by the ministry). This exception applies only to the person of the
‘Minister’ and cannot be extended to other representatives (such as State Secretaries,
Deputy Ministers or Directors/Head of Departments); these persons are not exempted
from the obligation to provide an ID document.
❖ Public bodies and governmental entities — For public bodies and other
state/governmental entities, including executive services at central/regional/local
level, the highest-ranked person (e.g. Director-General, President, Mayor, etc) will be
recognized as legal representative by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the entity, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website).
❖ International organisations — For international organisations, the highest-
ranked person (e.g. Secretary, Secretary-General) will be recognised as legal
representative by default.
24EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the international organisation, the
evidence may also be taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the
organisational chart published on the official website of the international
organisation).
❖ Universities and higher education establishments — For universities and
other higher education establishments (e.g. colleges, institutes, etc), the following
roles/functions are recognised as legal representative by default, without any further
verification of their powers:
− Rector and Vice-Rector
− President and Vice-President
− Chancellor and Vice Chancellor.
In case of faculties with their own legal personality (and thus independently
validated), the Dean and Vice-Dean can also act as legal representatives by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the university/higher education
establishment/faculty, the evidence may also be taken from other appropriate
sources (e.g. the organisational chart published on the official internet-site of the
university/faculty).
3.3 LEAR replacement
A LEAR replacement is equivalent to a new LEAR appointment. For the replacement of
an already validated LEAR, participants must submit the same type of documents and
the Central Validation Service will follow the procedure for the validation of LEAR
appointment (see above).
3.4 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant did not respect the obligation to keep the original
documents or committed other irregularities, appropriate measures will be taken.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, or
contribution agreements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts
paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
4. Financial capacity assessment
4.1 Financial capacity assessment: Criteria and conditions
In addition to the legal entity validation and LEAR appointment, the Central Validation
Service also assists the EU services with the financial capacity assessment (required
by the Financial Regulation for grants and procurements; not needed for prizes or
contribution agreements).
25EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The financial capacity assessment must in principle be done for each new
application/tender (— unless the participant already has a valid financial capacity
assessment performed by the Central Validation Service that is not older than 18
months).
Additional conditions depend on the type of procedure (grant or procurement),
participant and grant amount (e.g. no financial capacity assessment is needed for
public bodies in grant procedures, for Member State organisations, international
organisations, persons in receipt of education support, persons most in need and in
receipt of direct support; for low-value grants and low-value procurements).
Additional exemptions are provided in some programmes for specific situations or
types of participants.
Moreover, the financial capacity may be assessed ad hoc if there are justified grounds
to doubt it, like for example:
− indication of weak/insufficient financial capacity from other sources
− involvement in cases of serious administrative errors or fraud
− pending legal procedures or judicial proceedings for serious administrative
errors or fraud
− attachment order or recovery order for an outstanding amount issued by an
EU body on which the payment is significantly overdue
− substantial findings in EU audits within the last 2 years that put in doubt the
financial capacity.
The financial capacity is assessed on the basis of financial indicators that are in
principle the same for all EU programmes.
The financial capacity assessment is normally done during grant preparation/tender
evaluation but may also be done during implementation. If a participants’ financial
capacity must be assessed, they will be contacted by the Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The role of the Central Validation Service is to prepare the financial capacity
assessment (e.g. to collect and to analyse the financial documents). The final decision
on the financial capacity will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender separately
by the EU service in charge.
4.2 Documents and information to provide
4.2.1 General requirements and principles
The financial assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the EU
services at any time).
As a general rule, financial documents must be provided in their original language(s),
as imposed by the legislation in the participant’s country of registration. For
documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit an English free
(unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in non-EU
languages, a free translation in English is always mandatory and needs to be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
26EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
Some examples of such documents are: dated and signed annual management
reports in English for a company listed on the stock exchange or having international
shareholders or for the purpose of consolidation within a foreign group; dated and
signed extracts from national registers that use English, etc.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as any information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw or correct the financial assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
4.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Profit and loss account — approved by the management of the entity, clearly
indicating the amounts of turnover from sales of goods and services, operating
income, staff, depreciation, amortization costs, net operating result and
interest expenses. If this information is not indicated in the profit and loss
account or in the explanatory notes it must be provided in the form of a self-
declaration.
2. Balance sheet statement — approved by the management, clearly indicating
the nature and the maturity (i.e. below or above one year) of receivables and
other current assets, grants, provisions and debts. If this information is not
indicated in the balance sheet or in the explanatory notes it must be provided
in the form of a self-declaration.
3. Explanatory notes and/or annexes that form part of the above financial
statements (if available).
4. External audit report or self-declaration
Participants requesting a grant amount of above 750 000 EUR (for action
grants) or above 100 000 EUR (for operating grants) must provide:
− an statutory audit report issued by an approved/certified external
auditor if:
− such a report is available or
− a statutory audit is required under EU or national law
or
27EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− a declaration on the validity of the accounts* (self-declaration), signed
by the legal representative of the entity, which certifies the validity of
the accounts.
The documents provided must cover the last two closed financial years. The most
recent year must have been closed within the last 18 months.
Exceptions are allowed for:
− start-up companies without closed annual accounts which provide
prospective data (business plan) for one year only
− recently created entities which have closed annual accounts for one year
only. These entities will be assessed based on the documents for the sole
closed financial year
A single financial document containing comparative data of the annual accounts of
both years under assessment will be accepted. The same applies to an external audit
report covering the two financial years.
If some (or all) of the documents have already been provided for the financial years
in question (i.e. uploaded in the Participant Register), the participant does not need
to submit them again.
The audit report must include:
− the clear mandate and scope of the audit
− the responsibilities of the management and the auditor
− the way in which the audit is carried out
− the auditor’s opinion, including a reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
All documents must be provided simultaneously (profit and loss account, balance
sheet, audit report/self-declaration, etc).
No audit report/self-declaration is needed for entities participating in tender
procedures, for natural persons and entities without closed accounts.
Specific cases
❖ Subsidiaries without own financial statements — Subsidiaries which do not
prepare their own financial statements may provide the consolidated accounts and
the audit report/self-declaration of the parent company/group they belong to under
the following conditions:
− the entity is exempt under national law from statutory audits
− only consolidated statements of the parent company/group the entity belongs
to are available
and
− the parent company assumes joint liability for all the debts of the entity (— all
conditions must be fulfilled).
In such cases, participants will be requested to provide additional documents to prove

❖ Parent companies — Parent companies which are exempt under national law
from publishing individual (i.e. non-consolidated) financial statements will be
requested to provide a dated and signed by the management simplified summary of
their non-consolidated profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
These simplified accounts must respect either the minimum reporting requirements
set out in the national accounting law or Annexes III, IV, V and VI of Directive
2013/349 (for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings
preceded by letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
If the provided financial information is not sufficiently clear, the Central Validation
Service may contact participants for further clarifications.
❖ Newly established enterprises that have not yet closed accounts — Must
provide estimated financial data (i.e. a business plan or a similar document including
financial projections on current and non-current assets, own capital, current and non-
current liabilities, turnover, operating and financial income and charges).
The financial data must respect either the minimum reporting requirements set out in
the national accounting law or to Annexes III, IV, V and VI of EU Directive 2013/34
(for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings preceded by
letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
❖ Natural persons engaged in an economic activity who do not prepare financial
statements in relation to their business activities — Are requested to provide:
− the annual income tax declaration containing details on the revenues and
expenses from business activity
− a signed declaration of patrimony, including:
− fixed patrimony (e.g. land, tenement, hereditament, medium/long-term
deposits (more than one year), stock options that cannot be exercised
within one year)
− current patrimony (e.g. available cash, savings, short-term deposits
(maximum of one year), stock-options that can be exercised within one
year)
and
− a signed declaration of debts, which must contain all liabilities (with dates and
figures), broken down in short-term debts (of maximum one year) and
medium/long-term debts (of more than one year).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities operating cash-based accounting — If the available financial
documents do not contain a profit and loss account and a balance sheet but are
limited to a cash flow statement and/or do not contain sufficient information10,
9 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual
financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of
undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and
repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19–76).
10 E.g. missing information on the nature of revenues, expenses or equity, nature and liquidity of
receivables and assets, maturity of debts etc.
29EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
declarations signed by the authorised legal representative of the entity may be
accepted, if they provide:
− information on fixed and current assets: buildings, equipment, inventory, cash,
short/long term11 deposits, short/long term receivables, sort/long term
liabilities, grants and equity/sources of funding, etc
− information on revenues and expenses, such as turnover from sales of goods
and services, operating income, staff expenses depreciation/amortisation
costs, interest expenses, etc.
In addition, it is recommended to provide any available evidence supporting the
declared amounts (e.g. bank statements confirming the available balance at
accounting closure date, etc).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities covered by a guarantor — Entities that are covered by a full financial
guarantee of another legal entity (i.e. guarantor) may submit the financial data of the
guarantor, provided that it is a full guarantee (i.e. the guarantor has assumed full
joint liability for all debts). Ad-hoc guarantees (covering, for instance, only the
participation in EU projects) cannot be accepted.
Participants that would like to have the financial capacity of their guarantor
assessed, must first contact the service in charge of their application for approval of
the guarantee. In case of approval, the service in charge will request the Central
Validation Service to proceed with the assessment of the guarantor.
4.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
If the financial documents do not contain sufficient information regarding the nature
and the maturity of the current assets, provisions and liabilities, and such information
is not provided, the financial assessment will be completed by taking the most
prudent approach, e.g. by considering the maturity of the current assets to be after
one year, and of the provisions and liabilities to be within one year.
11 Short term — maximum of one year; long term — more than one year.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The financial assessment is valid for 18 months after the closure date of the most
recent assessed accounting period. If during this period the participant applies for
another grant or tender, the financial documents will not be requested again.
However, if there are justified grounds to doubt the financial capacity, a new
assessment may be triggered even before the end of the 18 months.
4.4 Modification of the assessment
In case of disagreement with the assessment, the participant may contact the Central
Validation Service by sending additional justifications via Participant Register
message. The subject of the message should be clearly labelled as related to the
financial assessment (not PIC validation, LEAR assessment or other).
The Central Validation Service will carry out a re-assessment on the basis of the
additional documents.
4.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant made false declarations, their status may be
changed.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants or procurements, their
participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
5. Ownership control assessment
5.1 Ownership control assessment: Criteria and conditions
For funding programmes which have restricted calls in which only participants which
are directly or indirectly controlled by EU Member States or by nationals of EU
Member States (or by entities or nationals of specified eligible countries) are eligible,
the Central Validation Service will also handle the ownership control assessment
analysis.
The ownership control assessment must in principle be done for each new grant,
procurement or contribution agreement (— unless the participant already has a valid
ownership control assessment in the system performed by the Central Validation
Service that is not older than 18 months).
Moreover, the ownership control may be assessed ad hoc if there are grounds
justifying a new assessment, like for example:
− indication of third country control from other sources
− indication of ownership control changes after the initial assessment.
31EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The ownership control assessment will usually look into both ownership and control
elements, in order to assess whether an entity is EU controlled or non-EU controlled.
The focus is however on control (see Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and
CEF-DIG restricted calls*).
In this context, ‘control’ will be defined as the possibility to exercise decisive influence
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate entities, ‘de jure’ or ‘de facto’.
The fact that no influence is actually exercised is not relevant, as long as the
possibility exists.
Control will be assessed at the level of the ultimate ownership and control line and all
intermediate layers (in case of indirect control), taking into consideration decision-
making mechanisms, corporate governance, shareholders’/members’ rights, etc.
The assessment is based on the information provided by the participant in the
ownership control declaration* (annexed to their application for EU funding or
procurement procedure) and supporting documents to be provided by the participant
during the ownership control assessment procedure.
The role of the Central Validation Service is limited to identifying instances of
possible non-EU-country/entity control (e.g. to collect and to analyse the supporting
documents). The final decision will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender
separately by the EU service in charge, in accordance with the specific programme
rules.If needed, during grant preparation, the EU service in charge may contact
participants about the outcome of the ownership control assessment.
5.2 Documents and information to provide
5.2.1 General requirements and principles
The ownership control assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by
the participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be
kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the
EU services at any time).
As a general rule, ownership control documents must be provided in their original
language. For documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit
an English free (unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in
non-EU languages, a free translation in English is mandatory and must be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
The participant assumes full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as the information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
5.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Graph visualising the complete ownership structure/chain of control, including
all ownership layers/chain of control until the ultimate owners.
2. Proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners and their respective
percentage of interest and voting rights, for instance commercial registry
extracts, articles of association/incorporation documents/memorandum of
association/company’s shareholders/members/partners book/registry extract,
etc with the exact distribution of shares/voting rights, i.e. name of
shareholders/members/partners and their percentage of interest andvoting
rights, as well as information on their place of establishment (in case of legal
entity) or nationality (in case of natural persons).
3. Statutes, articles of association, shareholders’/partnership agreements,
memorandum of understanding among shareholders, investment agreements
between shareholders and other relevant documents regarding the decision-
making procedures within the legal entity and the related rights of the
shareholders/members/partners.
4. Documents establishing/describing the decision-making bodies, rules regarding
election, appointment, nomination, dismissal and tenure of members, and
decision-making procedures (e.g. articles of association, bylaws, reports on
corporate governance, internal corporate governance rules, minutes of board
meetings, etc).
5. For participants that are listed companies, subsidiaries or controlled by a listed
company: report/minutes of the last three shareholders meetings, together
with the attendance list identifying the present/represented shareholders and
their respective votes.
6. Cooperation agreements with customers or suppliers, when they could confer
control over the participant — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
7. For shareholders/owners that provide financial contributions: supporting
documents (loans, by-laws, etc) that justify the financial contribution;
documents showing the link between the shareholder/owner and the entity
providing the financing — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
8. Information about any other means, process or links that could ultimately
confer control to a non-EU country or non-EU country entity.
9. Copy of ID card(s) or passport(s) indicating the nationality of the ultimate
owner(s).
The same documents and information must be provided for each intermediate
controlling entity, up to the ultimate owners. The supporting documents must
demonstrate the complete ownership structure, including all layers of ownership and
non-controlling entities.
33EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Guarantees for non-EU controlled entities (if allowed by the call conditions and
required by the EU service in charge) are not part of the ownership control
assessment and must therefore be submitted directly to the EU service in charge of
the grant/tender, in accordance with the specific programme rules.
5.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
not to finalise the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and
documents submitted or publicly available).
5.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The ownership control assessment is in principle valid for 18 months. If during this
period the participant applies for another grant or tender and confirms that the
ownership control status has not changed, the supporting documents will not be
requested again.
In this case, the participants will still have to submit the ownership control
declaration with the application, but there will be no check by the Central Validation
Service, unless there are justified grounds to doubt the declaration.
5.4 Modification of the assessment
Changes in the ownership control status need to be communicated to the granting
authority/contracting authority, which will trigger a new assessment by the Central
Validation Service, if needed.
For more information on the ownership control assessment procedure, see the
Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and CEF-DIG restricted calls*.

EU FUNDING & TENDERS PORTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE
1.1 The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is an electronic portal and exchange
system managed by the European Commission and used by itself and several
other EU services (together ‘EU’), for the management of EU funding/tenders (i.e.
grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, experts, etc).
1.2 It is currently open to:
− users applying for or managing EU grants, tenders and prizes
− entities entering into EU contribution agreements
− external experts and audit firms appointed to work for the EU in the
context of EU funding programmes
and allows them to:
− register (in the Participant Register or Expert Data Base) and view and
edit their data
− create, revise and submit proposals for funding and tenders
− prepare and sign contracts
− manage their projects and contracts (e.g. submit deliverables, reports
and payment requests)
− for experts: perform their tasks inside the system (evaluation,
monitoring, etc)
− for external audit firms: perform their tasks inside the system (audit
management).
1.3 These Terms and Conditions govern the relation between the following parties:
− the European Commission (as owner of the Portal)
and
− users
in relation to access and use of the Portal.
For the avoidance of doubt, it does not cover the terms and conditions related to
the grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements or expert contracts that
are managed through the Portal; those are governed by their own legal framework
and contractual arrangements.
1.4 Requesting access to the Portal, accessing the Portal or using the Portal signifies
unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
Users will be requested to agree explicitly to the Terms and Conditions on their first
login to the Portal.
For users acting on behalf of organisations, the legal representatives of the
organisations will also be asked to explicitly agree at the moment they appoint their
LEAR/EXAFs (through the ‘declaration of consent’; see below).
3EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Organisations must provide their LEAR/EXAFs, LSIGNs and FSIGNs with a copy of
these Terms and Conditions.
Users are responsible for regularly verifying the applicable Terms and Conditions.
1.5 These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the
European Commission and users, as regards the conditions for access and use of
the Portal.
2. ACCESS TO THE PORTAL
2.1 Users
2.1.1 Access to the public parts of the Portal is open to all users.
2.1.2 Access to the Portal electronic exchange system (EES) is open only to persons
with an EU Login account.
2.1.3 Access rights to certain information and functions in the EES are restricted to
users with specific roles (which are in turn linked to their functions within their
organisation or in relation to a particular
proposal/project/grant/contract/agreement).
2.1.4 Organisations can access the EES only via individual users employed by or
representing them.
2.2 Means of access to the EES — EU Login user account
2.2.1 Users must obtain an EU Login account in accordance with the applicable
procedures.
Users who already have an EU Login account must use that account.
2.2.2 Users guarantee that the information provided for registration for the account is
accurate and complete.
The European Commission has — at any time — the right to verify the accuracy
and validity of the information.
If this reveals any inaccuracy or invalidity, the European Commission has the right
to close the account and suspend or refuse access.
2.2.3 The means of access (i.e. the user name and password) are strictly personal and
users are responsible for safeguarding their confidentiality and security, and
ensuring their appropriate use.
Users undertake to take all steps to prevent any unauthorised third party from
gaining knowledge and making use thereof.
Users may not transfer or sell their means of access to third parties.
Users must notify the European Commission immediately (via the IT Helpdesk;
see Funding & Tenders Portal Support menu) of the loss, theft, breach of
confidentiality or any risk of misuse of the means of access.
If the European Commission has any reason to suspect that the confidentiality or
security of the means of access has been breached or that the EES is being
misused, it may — without prior notice — suspend or refuse access.

2.4 LEAR appointment
2.4.1 Organisations using the EES for transactions requiring electronic signatures are
required to appoint a LEAR.
2.4.2 Individuals (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons) will automatically have the
role of LEAR (no appointment needed); but they will have to provide the
supporting documents. Organisations can appoint only one LEAR — who can be
replaced if necessary, following the same appointment process.
2.4.3 Organisations warrant that the person appointed as LEAR is duly authorised to
represent them in relation to all LEAR responsibilities.
Organisations are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of the LEAR
responsibilities and to ensure that the LEAR remains at all times duly authorised
to represent them in relation to these responsibilities.
2.4.4 Supporting documents must be provided directly in the system.
2.4.5 Signed originals must be kept on file for controls (which may take place at any
moment and independently of any ongoing grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements or expert contracts).
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to the closure of the EU Login
account and suspension and refusal of access (and possibly termination of ongoing
grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements and expert contracts).
2.5 Appointment of signatories in the EES — (P)LSIGNs and (P)FSIGNs
2.5.1 The LEAR must appoint one or more LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation.
2.5.2 The LEAR and its organisation warrant that the persons appointed as LSIGNs or

been made when they are received by the receiving party (i.e. on the

accessed within 10 calendar days after sending are considered to have
