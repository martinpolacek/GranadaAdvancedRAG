According to the Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU classified information, “European Union
classified information (EUCI) means any information or material designated by an EU security classification, the unauthorised disclosure of which could cause varying
degrees of prejudice to the interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States”.
3
Classified background information is information that is already classified by a country and/or international organisation and/or the EU and is going to be used by the
project. In this case, the project must have in advance the authorisation from the originator of the classified information, which is the entity (EU institution, EU Member
State, third state or international organisation) under whose authority the classified information has been generated.
4
EU classified foreground information is information (documents/deliverables/materials) planned to be generated by the project and that needs to be protected from
unauthorised disclosure. The originator of the EUCI generated by the project is the European Commission.

responsive so that they can measure gender equality changes over time. For instance, a gender responsive indicator
can measure the increase in women’s rate of employment or changes in social attitudes towards gender roles in
work-life balance. The evaluation should be participatory and inclusive to all stakeholders, ensuring that women’s and
men’s voices are prevalent throughout the entire evaluation process.

2.7 Risk management
Critical risks and risk management strategy
Describe critical risks, uncertainties or difficulties related to the implementation of your project, and your
measures/strategy for addressing them.
Indicate for each risk (in the description) the impact and the likelihood that the risk will materialise (high, medium,
low), even after taking into account the mitigating measures. d
e
Note: Uncertainties and unexpected events occur in all organisations, even if very well-run. The risk analysis will help
you to predict issues that could delay or hinder project activities. A good risk managemtent strategy is essential for
good project management. The strategy should also incorporate risk mitigation
mease
ures that redress any gender
inequalities and multiple discriminatory effects in project implementation. For instpalnce, to ensure full participation of
target groups in project activities, gender, age or disability-specific constrains should be taken into acount. The target
m
groups may face more than one barrier to access project activities (accessibility barriers; language barriers,
availibility of childcare provision, etc ). Therefore, it is essential to identify these risks and undertake preventive
o
measures in order to ensure full partcipation of women and men in all their diversity in project design and
implementation. c

3.1 Impact and ambition
a
x
Impact and ambitEion
Define the short, medium and long-term effects of the project.
Who are the target groups? How will the target groups benefit concretely from the project and what would change for
them? In what way will the gap identified be reduced? How will the activities contribute to improve the situation
(difference between starting point/state of play and the situation after the end of the project?) How will the activities
contribute to the promotion and advancement of gender equality and non-discrimination mainstreaming?
Does the project aim to trigger change/innovation? If so, describe them and the degree of ambition (progress beyond
the status quo).
Note: Results/outcomes are immediate changes that materialise for the target groups after the end of the project
(e.g. improved knowledge, increased awareness). Results/outcomes are different to deliverables. Deliverables are
activities undertaken and outputs produced with the resources allocated to the project, e.g. training courses,
conferences, manuals, video etc.
When defining expected results/outcomes and deliverables please consider if and how they will reduce, maintain, or
increase inequalities between women and men, boys and girls, in all their diversity. What gender, age and disability
differentiated results can be expected? How expected results will affect women and men, boys and girls from a range
of diverse social groups, differently?

3.2 Communication, dissemination and visibility
Communication, dissemination and visibility of funding
Describe the communication and dissemination activities which are planned in order to promote the activities/results
and maximise the impact (to whom, which format, how many, etc.). Clarify how you will reach the target groups,
relevant stakeholders, policymakers and the general public and explain the choice of the dissemination channels.
Describe how the visibility of EU funding will be ensured.
Communication and dissemination activities should also contribute to the promotion of gender equality and non-
discrimination. Communication materials should use gender inclusive language and positive visual representations.
E.g.: When developing videos or leaflets ensure that women and men, in all their diversity, are equally represented in
a non-stereotypical fashion and portrayed in active empowered roles. In addition, consider using communication
channels that they are accessible to general audience, in particular to persons with disabilities, or people from
marginalised groups.

This section concerns a detailed description of the project activities.
l
Group your activities into work packages. A work package means a mapjor sub-division of the project. For each work package, enter an objective (expected outcome) and list the activities,
milestones and deliverables that belong to it. The grouping should be lomgical and guided by identifiable outputs.
Projects should normally have a minimum of 2 work packages.
a
WP1 should cover the management and coordination activities (meetings, coordination, project monitoring and evaluation, financial management, progress reports, etc) and all the activities which
x
are cross-cutting and therefore difficult to assign to another specific work package (do not try splitting these activities across different work packages).
E
WP2 and further WPs should be used for the other project activities. You can create as many work packages as needed by copying WP2. Please limit the number of work packages to max 6 and
the number of deliverables (and their data volume) to max 20 for the entire project.
Work packages covering financial support to third parties ( only allowed if authorised in the Call document) must describe the conditions for implementing the support (for grants: max amounts
per third party; criteria for calculating the exact amounts, types of activity that qualify (closed list), persons/categories of persons to be supported and criteria and procedures for giving support; for
prizes: eligibility and award criteria, amount of the prize and payment arrangements).
Enter each activity/milestone/output/outcome/deliverable only once (under one work package).
Ensure consistency with the detailed budget table/calculator and Part A (if applicable). (n/a for prefixed Lump Sum Grants)

Objectives
List the specific objectives to which the work package is linked.
Activities and division of work (WP description)
Provide a concise overview of the work (planned tasks). Be specific and give a short name and number for each task.
d
Show who is participating in each task: Coordinator (COO), Beneficiaries (BEN), Affiliated Entities (AE), Associated Partners (AP), indicating in bold the task leader.
e
Add information on other participants’ involvement in the project e.g. subcontractors, in-kind contributions.
t
Examples of tasks in WP1: project management/coordination activities, financial management, evaluation activities. e
Examples of tasks for WP2 and following (depending on the work package): trainings delivery, seminars/final conferencpel, drafting and advocating policy recommendations, data collection, data
analysis, work on training material, social media communication activities, drafting and publishing newsletters.
m
Note:
In-kind contributions: In-kind contributions for free are cost-neutral, i.e. cannot be declared as cost. Please indicateo the in-kind contributions that are provided in the context of this work package
The Coordinator remains fully responsible for the coordination tasks, even if they are delegated to someone elcse. Coordinator tasks cannot be subcontracted (see Model Grant Agreement).
If there is subcontracting, please also complete the table below. e
b
Milestones and deliverables (outputs/outcomes)
o
Milestones are control points in the project that help to chart progress (e.g. completion of at key deliverable allowing the next phase of the work to begin). Use them only for major outputs in
complex projects, otherwise leave the section empty. Please limit the number of milestones b y work package.
t
Means of verification are how you intend to prove that a milestone has been reached. If aoppropriate, you can also refer to indicators.
Deliverables are project outputs which are submitted to show project progress (anyn format). Refer only to major outputs. Do not include minor sub-items or internal working papers, meeting
minutes, etc. Limit the number of deliverables (and their data volume) to max 20 fo r the entire project. You may be asked to further reduce the number during grant preparation.
,
Examples of milestones and deliverables for WP 1: e
Milestones - control points in the project that help to chart progresls, e.g. signature of the consortium agreement;
p
Deliverables - transnational/ national coordination meetings, smteering committees, evaluation report, progress report to the EU.
Examples of milestones and deliverables for WP 2:
a
Milestones - control points in the project that help to chart progress (e.g. completion of a major task);
x
Deliverables - publications, leaflets, trainings, webinars, conferences, seminars, reports, toolkits, manuals.
E
For deliverables such as meetings, events, seminars, trainings, workshops, webinars, conferences, etc., enter each deliverable separately and provide the following in the 'Description' field:
invitation, agenda, signed presence list, target group, number of estimated participants, duration of the event, report of the event, training material package, presentations, evaluation report,
feedback questionnaire.
For deliverables such as manuals, toolkits, guides, reports, leaflets, brochures, training materials etc., add in the ‘Description’ field: format (electronic or printed), language(s), approximate number
of pages and estimated number of copies of publications (if any).
For each deliverable you will have to indicate a due month by when you commit to upload it in the Portal. The due month of the deliverable cannot be outside the duration of the work package and
must be in line with the timeline provided below. Month 1 marks the start of the project and all deadlines should be related to this starting date.

Subcontracting
Give details on subcontracted project tasks (if any) and explain the reasons why (as opposed to direct implementation by the Beneficiaries/Affiliated Entities).
Subcontracting — Subcontracting means the implementation of ‘action tasks’, i.e. specific tasks which are part of the EU grant and are described in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement.
Note: Subcontracting concerns the outsourcing of a part of the project to a party outside the consortium. It is not simply about purchasing goods or services. We normally expect that the participants
have sufficient operational capacity to implement the project activities themselves. Subcontracting should therefore be exceptional.
Include only subcontracts that comply with the rules (i.e. best value for money and no conflict of interest; no subcontracting of coordinator tasks). Make sure that subcontractors are aware of the
principles of gender mainstreaming and non-discrimination mainstreaming.

5.1 Ethics and EU values
Ethics and EU value
Describe ethics issues that may arise during the project implementation and the measures you intend to take to
solve/avoid them.
Describe how you will ensure gender and non-discrimination mainstreaming in the project cycle. This means
integrating gender equality and non-discrimination considerations in the design, implementation, monitoring and
evaluation of project activities. Projects activities should be pro-active and contribute to the equal empowerment of
women and men, girls and boys, in all their diversity, and ensure that they achieve their full potential, enjoy the same
rights and opportunities. Gender and non-discrimination mainstreaming are a key mechanism for achieving gender
equality and combating multiple and intersecting discrimination. In the delivery of project activities gender
mainstreaming shall be ensured by systematically monitoring access, participation, and benefits among different
genders, and by incorporating remedial action that redresses any gender inequalities and discriminatory effects in
implementation of planned activities. The activities shall also seek to reduce levels of discrimination suffered by
particular groups (as well as those at risk of multiple discrimination) and to improve equality outdcomes for individuals.
If your project has a direct or indirect impact on children and their rights, indicate it clearly heere. Make sure that your
project is based on a child rights approach, i.e. that all the rights of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the
t
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the Optional protoecols, are promoted, respected,
protected and fulfilled. The project should address children as rights holders and slhould ensure their participation in
the design and implementation of the project. If you will have direct contacts withp children you will have to provide a
child protection policies in line with the Keeping Children Safe Child Safeguardimng Standards.
Explain how you intend to address privacy/data protection issues related to data collection, analysis and
o
dissemination.
c
Outline measures to be taken and the policies in place to guarantee compliance with the EU values mentioned in
Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union and Article 21 of thee E U Charter of Fundamental Rights.

1. Background
Funding under this call will support national and transnational projects that promote
judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. While there are a number of EU
instruments in force which provide a legal framework for judicial cooperation among
Member States, projects funded by the EU budget can improve their application,
identify issues, facilitate contacts and in general improve the cooperation between the
relevant stakeholders.
Furthermore, in the digital age and against the background of the challenges
highlighted by the COVID-19 crisis, judicial cooperation needs to make full use of
electronic tools and channels to ensure the effective, swift, secure and resilient
communication between the competent authorities and with the relevant actors.
2. Objectives — Themes and priorities — Activities that can be funded —
Expected impact
JUST-2025-JCOO — Call for proposals for action grants to promote judicial
cooperation in civil and criminal matters.
Objectives (expected outcome)
Facilitate and support judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and promote
the rule of law, independence and impartiality of the judiciary, including by supporting
the efforts to improve the effectiveness of national justice systems, and the effective
enforcement of decisions.
Themes and priorities (scope)
There are three priorities for 2025:
1. Judicial cooperation in civil matters
The aim is to promote judicial cooperation in civil matters and to contribute to the
effective and coherent application and enforcement of EU instruments to create a
genuine European area of justice in civil and commercial matters and in the field of
family law.
Priority shall be given to projects aiming in particular at:
- better enforcement of judicial decisions through better procedures, case-
handling and cooperation in cross-border disputes;
- improving in a child-sensitive way the situation of children involved in civil cases,
e.g. through better procedures, case-handling and cooperation in the family law
6Call: JUST-2025-JCOO — Call for proposals for action grants to promote judicial cooperation in civil and
criminal matters
EU Grants: Call document (JUST): V1.0 – 22.11.2024
area such as parental responsibility, international child abduction and
maintenance or issues relating to civil status of children;
- facilitating cross-border procedures, e.g. on service of documents and taking of
evidence, on successions or cross-border circulation of public documents,
through better information and awareness-raising.
2. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters
The aim of this call for proposals is to promote judicial cooperation in criminal matters
and to contribute to the effective and coherent application of EU mutual recognition
instruments in criminal matters.
a) Priority shall be given to the implementation and practical application of the
following mutual recognition instruments:
- Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA on the European arrest warrant and
the surrender procedures between Member States;
- Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on the application of the principle of
mutual recognition to financial penalties;
- Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA on the application of the principle of
mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial
sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their
enforcement in the European Union;
- Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA on the application of the principle of
mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the
supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions;
- Council Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA on the application, between Member
States of the European Union, of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions
on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention;
- Directive 2014/41/EU regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal
matters;
- Regulation (EU) 2018/1805 on the mutual recognition of freezing orders and
confiscation orders.
A specific priority regarding any particular instrument(s) listed above may be given
in the call for proposals.
b) Priority shall also be given to:
- an efficient contribution to the European Security Union Strategy as regards the
judicial responses to terrorism, notably on reinforcing the prevention of
radicalisation, especially in prisons and after release from prison, and taking into
account the gender of (ex) detainees.
- implementation of the Commission Recommendation on detention4 and linked
issues related to detention conditions, including protection of vulnerable
detainees and prevention gender-based violence, pre-trial detention and
alternatives to detention, as well as raising awareness of case law of the
European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and recommendations of the Council
of Europe in this field;
4 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2023/681 of 8 December 2022 on procedural rights in pre-trial
detention and on material detention conditions.

- the functioning of Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) Treaties or other Treaties
containing provisions on MLA with third States (e.g. EU-US MLA Agreement,
Budapest Cybercrime Convention and its Second Additional Protocol), including
with respect to the exchange of electronic data.
Proposals not in line with priorities 1 and 2 may still be awarded funding, if applicants
can justify this by:
- the necessity to improve the implementation and application of the civil or criminal
justice EU acquis on the basis of an evidence-based needs assessment, showing that
more activities are required for the proper application of EU law in the field to be
covered;
- the need to improve judicial cooperation, e.g. in case of gaps in the acquis or to face
newly emerging challenges, on the basis of an evidence-based needs assessment.
However, applicants should take into account that a deviation from the priorities 1 and
2 may result in a less relevant proposal, which may therefore not be considered for
funding.
Applicants are strongly advised to research Commission initiatives in the filed of judicial
cooperation in civil and criminal matters to minimise the risk of replication of existing
structures, and in particular IT-platforms.
3. Support to the Member States for the setting up and strengthening of
national networks active in the area of judicial cooperation in civil and
criminal matters
The main objective is to contribute to the effective and coherent application of the EU
acquis relating to judicial cooperation in civil, commercial and criminal matters.
In the area of civil and commercial matters, support will be provided to the members
of the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters (EJN-civil) and to the
national authorities, courts and professional associations they represent. Projects will
focus on setting up and strengthening national EJN-civil networks to ensure better
handling of cross-border civil cases and more generally a better implementation of EU
legislation. The national networks will encourage the full participation of all national
Network members5 (e.g. central authorities, bailiffs, notaries, lawyers). This will help
to increase the contribution of EU countries to the Network's activities (in particular the
Network meetings) and enhance the work and visibility of the Network as a whole.
In the area of criminal matters, support will be provided to national authorities, courts,
prosecution services and professional associations representing them, for the setting
up and/or strengthening of national networks in order to ensure better implementation
of EU judicial cooperation instruments in criminal matters.
Strengthened national networks can promote better implementation of EU civil and
criminal justice instruments through cooperation, dialogue, sharing of experience,
exchange of information and training activities (where appropriate also in liaison with
other national systems). Through these activities the national projects would ensure
interaction at national level, knowledge sharing and gathering of information. As a
result, this would deepen EU-wide building bridges and mutual trust between different
justice systems.
5 As listed in Article 2(1) of the Council Decision establishing the EJN-civil
8Call: JUST-2025-JCOO — Call for proposals for action grants to promote judicial cooperation in civil and
criminal matters
EU Grants: Call document (JUST): V1.0 – 22.11.2024
Activities that can be funded (scope)
Whereas several measures and initiatives are listed, it is not requested to include all of
them in a single project. Projects with a strong focus are very much valued.
All activities should, both at design and implementation stage, incorporate a gender
equality perspective. Thus, applicants are expected to conduct and include in their
proposal a gender analysis, which maps the potential different impact of the project
and its activities on women and men as well as girls and boys in all their diversity.
Thereby, unintended negative effects of the intervention on either gender should be
forestalled (do no-harm approach). To this end, applicants are encouraged to consult
the key questions listed on the EIGE website when conducting their gender analysis. A
gender-sensitive approach should be taken to the identification of best practices, data
collection, including sex-disaggregated statistics, and information dissemination. All
communication activities should forestall discrimination, victimisation and stereotyping
of women and men. Mutual learning, analytical and training activities should
incorporate a gender equality perspective, and promote gender balanced participation
in trainings.
This topic will cover the following activities:
- facilitating cooperation between competent authorities and agencies, legal
practitioners and/or service providers (including multi-disciplinary networks at
international, national, regional or local levels);
- mutual learning, identifying and exchange of best practices, development of
working methods which may be transferable to other participating countries;
- analytical activities, including data collection, statistics, surveys, research, etc.;
- exchange and provision of information and development of information tools;
- capacity building for professionals;
- dissemination and awareness raising activities;
- training activities can also be funded under this call, as long as they are of
ancillary nature and not the main purpose of the project.
Activities under this topic, especially where they relate to IT software development
(priority 1), will take into account existing solutions such as results from the e-CODEX
project, CEF building blocks and ISA2 Core vocabularies.
Proposals with a practical focus are deemed more impactful than mere research
proposals.
Similarly, proposals that consider in their design and implementation a gender
perspective, are deemed more impactful (See also section 9).
Expected impact
For priorities 1 and 2:
• Increased capacity of national practitioners, courts and other competent
authorities to address issues related to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal
matters and to the application of the EU instruments on civil and civil procedural
law, as well as on criminal and criminal procedural law;
• Strengthened cooperation and exchange of information between competent
national authorities (including courts) in relation to judicial cooperation in civil

Children Safe Child Safeguarding Standards. ii) public entities must
provide at least a declaration on honour. See also section 6 on “Ethics
and EU values” below.
Please note that an annual activity report is NOT a financial audit report or balance
sheet, but a report highlighting the activities and projects of your organisation.
Please be aware that since the detailed budget table serves as the basis for fixing the
lump sums for the grants (and since lump sums must be reliable proxies for the actual
costs of a project), the costs you include MUST comply with the basic eligibility
conditions for EU actual cost grants (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 6).
This is particularly important for purchases and subcontracting, which must comply with
best value for money (or if appropriate the lowest price) and be free of any conflict of
interests. If the budget table contains ineligible costs, the grant may be reduced (even
later on during the project implementation or after their end).
At proposal submission, you will have to confirm that you have the mandate to act
for all applicants. Moreover, you will have to confirm that the information in the
application is correct and complete and that all participants comply with the conditions
for receiving EU funding (especially eligibility, financial and operational capacity,
exclusion, etc). Before signing the grant, each beneficiary and affiliated entity will have
to confirm this again by signing a declaration of honour (DoH). Proposals without full
support will be rejected.
Your application must be readable, accessible, and printable, please check carefully
the layout of the documents uploaded.
Proposals are limited to maximum 45 pages (Part B). Evaluators will not consider any
additional pages. Shorter proposals are welcome.
You may be asked at a later stage for further documents (for legal entity validation,
financial capacity check, bank account validation, etc).
For more information about the submission process (including IT aspects), consult
the Online Manual.

Project budget
For priority 1 (civil matters): Project budgets (requested grant amount) cannot be lower
than € 75 000. There is no upper limit.
For priority 2 (criminal matters) and priority 3 (EJN civil and criminal): Project
budgets (requested grant amount) are expected to range between EUR 75 000 and
EUR 350 000 per project.
The grant awarded may be lower than the amount requested.
Ethics and EU values
Projects must comply with:
− highest ethical standards
− EU values based on Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union and Article 21
of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and
− other applicable EU, international and national law (including the General Data
Protection Regulation 2016/679).
Projects must seek to promote gender equality and non-discrimination mainstreaming
in accordance with the Gender Mainstreaming Toolkit. Project activities should
contribute to the equal empowerment of women and men in all their diversity, ensuring
that that they achieve their full potential and enjoy the same rights. They should also
seek to reduce levels of discrimination suffered by particular groups (as well as those
at risk of multiple discrimination) and to improve equality outcomes for individuals10.
Proposals should integrate gender and non-discrimination considerations in proposals
and target a gender-balanced representation in project teams and activities. It is also
important that individual data collected by the beneficiaries are broken down by sex
(sex-disaggregated data), disability or age whenever possible.
Applicants must show in their application that they respect ethical principles and EU
values based on Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union and Article of the 21 EU
Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Participants with activities involving children must moreover have a child protection
policy covering the four areas described in the Keeping Children Safe Child Safeguarding
Standards. This policy must be available online and transparent to everyone who comes
in contact with the organisation. It must include clear information about the recruitment

must also include clear procedures and rules to staff, including reporting rules, and
continuous training.
7. Financial and operational capacity and exclusion
Financial capacity
Applicants must have stable and sufficient resources to successfully implement the
projects and contribute their share. Organisations participating in several projects must
have sufficient capacity to implement all projects.
The financial capacity check will be carried out on the basis of the documents you will
be requested to upload in the Participant Register during grant preparation (e.g. profit
and loss account and balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an

approved external auditor, certifying the accounts for the last closed financial year,
etc). The analysis will be based on neutral financial indicators, but will also take into
account other aspects, such as dependency on EU funding and deficit and revenue in
previous years.
The check will normally be done for coordinators, except:
− natural persons
− public bodies (entities established as public body under national law, including
local, regional, or national authorities) or international organisations
− if the project requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60 000.
If needed, it may also be done for affiliated entities.
If we consider that your financial capacity is not satisfactory, we may require:
− further information
− an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility
for all beneficiaries or joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see below,
section 10)
− prefinancing paid in instalments
− (one or more) prefinancing guarantees (see below, section 10)
or
− propose no prefinancing
− request that you are replaced or, if needed, reject the entire proposal.
For more information, see Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Operational capacity
Applicants must have the know-how, qualifications, and resources to successfully
implement the projects and contribute their share (including sufficient experience in
projects of comparable size and nature).
This capacity will be assessed together with the ‘Quality’ award criterion, on the basis
of the competence and experience of the applicants and their project teams, including
operational resources (human, technical and other) or, exceptionally, the measures
proposed to obtain it by the time the task implementation starts.
If the evaluation of the award criterion is positive, the applicants are considered to have
sufficient operational capacity.
Applicants will have to show their capacity via the following information:
− general profiles (qualifications and experiences) of the staff responsible for
managing and implementing the project
− description of the consortium participants
− activity report of last year of the coordinator (if applicable)
− list of previous projects (key projects for the last 4 years) (template available in
Part B).

Additional supporting documents may be requested, if needed to confirm the
operational capacity of any applicant.
Public bodies, Member State organisations and international organisations are
exempted from the operational capacity check.
Exclusion
Applicants which are subject to an EU exclusion decision or in one of the following
exclusion situations that bar them from receiving EU funding can NOT participate11:

the award/implementation of the grant).
− intentionally and without proper justification resisted13 an investigation, check
or audit carried out by an EU authorising officer (or their representative or
auditor), OLAF, the EPPO, or the European Court of Auditors.
11 See Articles 138 and 143 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 .
12 ‘Professional misconduct’ includes, in particular, the following: violation of ethical standards of the
profession; wrongful conduct with impact on professional credibility; breach of generally accepted
professional ethical standards; false declarations/misrepresentation of information; participation in a
cartel or other agreement distorting competition; violation of IPR; attempting to influence decision-
making processes by taking advantage, through misrepresentation, of a conflict of interests, or to obtain
confidential information from public authorities to gain an advantage; incitement to discrimination,
hatred or violence or similar activities contrary to the EU values where negatively affecting or risking to
affect the performance of a legal commitment.
13 ‘Resisting an investigation, check or audit’ means carrying out actions with the goal or effect of

criminal matters
EU Grants: Call document (JUST): V1.0 – 22.11.2024
Applicants will also be rejected if it turns out that14:
− during the award procedure they misrepresented information required as a
condition for participating or failed to supply that information
− they were previously involved in the preparation of the call, and this entails a
distortion of competition that cannot be remedied otherwise (conflict of
interest).
8. Evaluation and award procedure
The proposals will have to follow the standard submission and evaluation
procedure (one-stage submission + one-step evaluation).
An evaluation committee (assisted by independent outside experts) will assess all
applications. Proposals will first be checked for formal requirements (admissibility, and
eligibility, see sections 5 and 6). Proposals found admissible and eligible will be
evaluated against the operational capacity and award criteria (see sections 7 and 9)
and then ranked according to their scores.
For proposals with the same score a priority order will be determined according to the
following approach:
Successively for every group of ex aequo proposals, starting with the highest scored
group, and continuing in descending order:
1) The ex aequo proposals within the same topic will be prioritised according to the
scores they have been awarded for the award criterion ‘Relevance’. When these
scores are equal, priority will be based on their scores for the criterion ‘Quality’.
When these scores are equal, priority will be based on their scores for the
criterion ‘Impact’.
All proposals will be informed about the evaluation result (evaluation result letter).
Successful proposals will be invited for grant preparation; the other ones will be put on
the reserve list or rejected.
No commitment for funding — Invitation to grant preparation does NOT constitute a
formal commitment for funding. We will still need to make various legal checks before
grant award: legal entity validation, financial capacity, exclusion check, etc.
Grant preparation will involve a dialogue in order to fine-tune technical or financial
aspects of the project and may require extra information from your side. It may also
include adjustments to the proposal to address recommendations of the evaluation
committee or other concerns. Full compliance will be a pre-condition for signing the
grant.
If you believe that the evaluation procedure was flawed, you can submit a complaint
(following the deadlines and procedures set out in the evaluation result letter). Please
note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending will be
considered to have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from
opening/access (see also Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions). Please also
be aware that for complaints submitted electronically, there may be character
limitations.

Award criteria Minimum Maximum
pass score score
Relevance 25 40
Quality n/a 40
Impact n/a 20
Overall (pass) scores 70 100
Maximum points: 100 points.
Individual threshold for the criterion ‘Relevance’: 25/40 points.
Overall threshold: 70 points.
Proposals that pass the individual threshold for the criterion ‘Relevance’ AND the overall
threshold will be considered for funding — within the limits of the available budget (i.e.
up to the budget ceiling). Other proposals will be rejected.
10. Legal and financial set-up of the Grant Agreements
If you pass evaluation, your project will be invited for grant preparation, where you will
be asked to prepare the Grant Agreement together with the EU Project Officer.
This Grant Agreement will set the framework for your grant and its terms and
conditions, in particular concerning deliverables, reporting and payments.
19Call: JUST-2025-JCOO — Call for proposals for action grants to promote judicial cooperation in civil and
criminal matters
EU Grants: Call document (JUST): V1.0 – 22.11.2024
The Model Grant Agreement that will be used (and all other relevant templates and
guidance documents) can be found on Portal Reference Documents.
Starting date and project duration
The project starting date and duration will be fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data Sheet,
point 1). Normally the starting date will be after grant signature. The action should start
within 6 months following the Grant Agreement signature, except in duly justified cases.
Retroactive application can be granted exceptionally for duly justified reasons — but
never earlier than the proposal submission date.
Project duration: see section 6 above.
Extensions are possible, if duly justified and through an amendment.
Work packages, milestones and deliverables
Activities must be grouped into work packages (e.g.: Project Management and
Coordination; Communication and Dissemination, etc.), which are major sub-divisions
of the project. The coordination and management costs of WP1 should not be higher
than 10% of the total cost of the proposal.
For each work package, an objective, list of the tasks/activities, milestones and
deliverables must be defined. The deliverables must be quantifiable and measurable.
The structure should be logical and guided by identifiable outputs with clear indicators.
The milestones and deliverables for each project will be managed through the Portal
Grant Management System and will be reflected in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement.
Beneficiaries will have to ask attendees in events to participate in the EU Survey on
Justice, Rights and Values. This survey allows the granting authority to closely monitor
training, mutual learning, and awareness-raising events. The beneficiaries will receive
a weblink to the survey, to be forwarded to the attendees. They will have access to the
survey results for their project and can use it for their project evaluation. The granting
authority will aggregate the results of all the projects financed under the Justice
programme.
Form of grant, funding rate and maximum grant amount
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc)
will be fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data Sheet, point 3 and art 5).
Project budget (requested grant amount): see section 6 above.
The grant awarded may be lower than the amount requested.
The grant will be a lump sum grant. This means that it will reimburse a fixed amount,
based on a lump sum or financing not linked to costs. The amount will be fixed by the
granting authority on the basis of the estimated project budget and a funding rate of
90%.
Budget categories and cost eligibility rules
The budget categories and cost eligibility rules are fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data
Sheet, point 3, art 6 and Annex 2).
Budget categories for this call:
20Call: JUST-2025-JCOO — Call for proposals for action grants to promote judicial cooperation in civil and
criminal matters
EU Grants: Call document (JUST): V1.0 – 22.11.2024
− Lump sum contributions15
Specific cost eligibility rules for this call:
− the lump sum amount must be calculated in accordance with the methodology
set out in the lump sum decision and using the detailed budget table provided
− the lump sum calculation should respect the following conditions:
− for lump sums based on estimated project budgets: the estimated budget
must comply with the basic eligibility conditions for EU actual cost grants
(see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 6)
− for lump sums based on estimated project budgets: costs for financial
support to third parties is not allowed
− communication costs for presenting the project on the participants’ websites
or social media accounts are eligible; costs for separate project websites are
not eligible
− personnel costs:
o volunteers’ unit costs16 are allowed (without indirect costs)
The details and the breakdown of the ‘Other cost’ items from headings A.1 and C.3
should be provided in the ‘any comments’ sheet of the detailed budget table.
Reporting and payment arrangements
The reporting and payment arrangements are fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data
Sheet, point 4 and art 21 and 22).
After grant signature, you will normally receive a prefinancing to start working on the
project (float of normally 80% of the maximum grant amount; exceptionally less or no
pre-financing). The pre-financing will be paid 30 days from entry into force/financial
guarantee (if required)— whichever is the latest.
For projects with duration of 24 months, you will be expected to submit one progress
report not linked to payments after 12 months.
Payment of the balance: At the end of the project, we will calculate your final grant
amount. If the total of earlier payments is higher than the final grant amount, we will
ask you (your coordinator) to pay back the difference (recovery).
All payments will be made to the coordinator.
Please be aware that payments will be automatically lowered if you or one of your
consortium members has outstanding debts towards the EU (granting authority or other
EU bodies). Such debts will be offset by us — in line with the conditions set out in the
Grant Agreement (see art 22).
Please also note that you are responsible for keeping records on all the work done.
15 Decision of 30/09/2022 authorising the use of lump sums for actions under the Justice Programme
(2021-2027).
16 Commission Decision of 10 April 2019 authorising the use of unit costs for declaring personnel costs for
the work carried out by volunteers under an action or a work programme (C(2019)2646)

criminal matters
EU Grants: Call document (JUST): V1.0 – 22.11.2024
Prefinancing guarantees
If a prefinancing guarantee is required, it will be fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data
Sheet, point 4). The amount will be set during grant preparation, and it will normally
be equal or lower than the prefinancing for your grant.
The guarantee should be in euro and issued by an approved bank/financial institution
established in an EU Member State. If you are established in a non-EU country and
would like to provide a guarantee from a bank/financial institution in your country,
please contact us (this may be exceptionally accepted, if it offers equivalent security).
Amounts blocked in bank accounts will NOT be accepted as financial guarantees.
Prefinancing guarantees are normally requested from the coordinator, for the
consortium. They must be provided during grant preparation, in time to make the
prefinancing (scanned copy via Portal AND original by post).
If agreed with us, the bank guarantee may be replaced by a guarantee from a third
party.
The guarantee will be released at the end of the grant, in accordance with the conditions
laid down in the Grant Agreement.
Certificates
Depending on the type of action, size of grant amount and type of beneficiaries, you
may be requested to submit different certificates. The types, schedules and thresholds
for each certificate are fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data Sheet, point 4 and art 24).
Liability regime for recoveries
The liability regime for recoveries will be fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data Sheet
point 4.4 and art 22).
For beneficiaries, it is one of the following:
− limited joint and several liability with individual ceilings — each beneficiary up
to their maximum grant amount.
− unconditional joint and several liability — each beneficiary up to the maximum
grant amount for the action
or
− individual financial responsibility — each beneficiary only for their own debts.
In addition, the granting authority may require joint and several liability of affiliated
entities (with their beneficiary).
Provisions concerning the project implementation
IPR rules: see Model Grant Agreement (art 16 and Annex 5):
− rights of use on results: Yes
Communication, dissemination, and visibility of funding: see Model Grant Agreement
(art 17 and Annex 5):
− additional communication and dissemination activities: Yes

11. How to submit an application
All proposals must be submitted directly online via the Funding & Tenders Portal
Electronic Submission System. Paper applications are NOT accepted.
Submission is a 2-step process:
a) create a user account and register your organisation
To use the Submission System (the only way to apply), all participants need to create
an EU Login user account.
Once you have an EULogin account, you can register your organisation in the Participant
Register. When your registration is finalised, you will receive a 9-digit participant
identification code (PIC).
b) submit the proposal
Access the Electronic Submission System via the Topic page in the Calls for proposals
section (or, for calls sent by invitation to submit a proposal, through the link provided
in the invitation letter).
Submit your proposal in 4 parts, as follows:
− Part A includes administrative information about the applicant organisations
(future coordinator, beneficiaries, affiliated entities, and associated partners)
and the summarised budget for the proposal. Fill it in directly online.
− Part B (description of the action) covers the technical content of the proposal.
Download the mandatory word template from the Submission System, fill it in
and upload it as a PDF file.
− KPI tool containing additional project data. To be filled in directly online, all
sections to be completed.
− Annexes (see section 5). Upload them as PDF file (single or multiple depending
on the slots). Excel upload is sometimes possible, depending on the file type.
Detailed budget table must be re-uploaded filled out in the format .xlsx.
The proposal must keep to the page limits (see section 5); excess pages will be
disregarded.
Documents must be uploaded to the right category in the Submission System,
otherwise the proposal may be considered incomplete and thus inadmissible.
The proposal must be submitted before the call deadline (see section 4). After this
deadline, the system is closed, and proposals can no longer be submitted.

criminal matters
EU Grants: Call document (JUST): V1.0 – 22.11.2024
Once the proposal is submitted, you will receive a confirmation e-mail (with date and
time of your application). If you do not receive this confirmation e-mail, it means your
proposal has NOT been submitted. If you believe this is due to a fault in the Submission
System, you should immediately file a complaint via the IT Helpdesk webform,
explaining the circumstances and attaching a copy of the proposal (and, if possible,
screenshots to show what happened).
Details on processes and procedures are described in the Online Manual. The Online
Manual also contains the links to FAQs and detailed instructions regarding the Portal
Electronic Exchange System.
12. Help
As far as possible, please try to find the answers you need yourself, in this and
the other documentation (we have limited resources for handling direct enquiries):
− Online Manual
− Topic Q&A on the Topic page (for call-specific questions in open calls; not
applicable for actions by invitation)
− Portal FAQ (for general questions).
Please also consult the call and topic pages regularly, since we will use it to publish call
updates, including an invitation to the info session for applicants (if any) after the
opening of the call. (For invitations, we will contact you directly in case of a call update).
Contact
For individual questions on the Portal Submission System, please contact the IT
Helpdesk.
Non-IT related questions should be sent to the following email address: EC-JUSTICE-

13. Important
IMPORTANT
• Don’t wait until the end — Complete your application sufficiently in advance
of the deadline to avoid any last minute technical problems. Problems due to
last minute submissions (e.g., congestion, etc) will be entirely at your risk. Call
deadlines can NOT be extended.
• Consult the Portal Topic page regularly. We will use it to publish updates and
additional information on the call (call and topic updates).
• Funding & Tenders Portal Electronic Exchange System — By submitting
the application, all participants accept to use the electronic exchange system
in accordance with the Portal Terms & Conditions.
• Registration — Before submitting the application, all beneficiaries, affiliated
entities and associated partners must be registered in the Participant Register.
The participant identification code (PIC) (one per participant) is mandatory for
the Application Form.
• Consortium roles — When setting up your consortium, you should think of
organisations that help you reach objectives and solve problems.
The roles should be attributed according to the level of participation in the
project. Main participants should participate as beneficiaries or affiliated
entities; other entities can participate as associated partners, subcontractors,
third parties giving in-kind contributions. Associated partners and third
parties giving in-kind contributions should bear their own costs (they will not
become formal recipients of EU funding). Subcontracting should normally
constitute a limited part and must be performed by third parties (not by one of
the beneficiaries/affiliated entities). Subcontracting going beyond 30% of the
total eligible costs must be justified in the application.
• Coordinator — In multi-beneficiary grants, the beneficiaries participate as
consortium (group of beneficiaries). They will have to choose a coordinator,
who will take care of the project management and coordination and will
represent the consortium towards the granting authority. In mono-beneficiary
grants, the single beneficiary will automatically be coordinator.
• Affiliated entities — Applicants may participate with affiliated entities (i.e.
entities linked to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights
and obligations as the beneficiaries, but do not sign the grant and therefore do
not become beneficiaries themselves). They will get a part of the grant money
and must therefore comply with all the call conditions and be validated (just
like beneficiaries); but they do not count towards the minimum eligibility criteria
for consortium composition (if any). If affiliated entities participate in your
project, please do not forget to provide documents demonstrating their
affiliation link to your organisation as part of your application.
• Associated partners — Applicants may participate with associated partners
(i.e. partner organisations which participate in the action but without the right
to get grant money). They participate without funding and therefore do not
need to be validated.
25Call: JUST-2025-JCOO — Call for proposals for action grants to promote judicial cooperation in civil and
criminal matters
EU Grants: Call document (JUST): V1.0 – 22.11.2024
• Consortium agreement — For practical and legal reasons it is recommended
to set up internal arrangements that allow you to deal with exceptional or
unforeseen circumstances (in all cases, even if not mandatory under the Grant
Agreement). The consortium agreement also gives you the possibility to
redistribute the grant money according to your own consortium-internal
principles and parameters (for instance, one beneficiary can reattribute its grant
money to another beneficiary). The consortium agreement thus allows you to
customise the EU grant to the needs inside your consortium and can also help
to protect you in case of disputes.
• Balanced project budget — Grant applications must ensure a balanced
project budget and sufficient other resources to implement the project
successfully (e.g., own contributions, income generated by the action, financial
contributions from third parties, etc). You may be requested to lower your
estimated costs if they are ineligible (including excessive).
• Completed/ongoing projects — Proposals for projects that have already
been completed will be rejected; proposals for projects that have already
started will be assessed on a case-by-case basis (in this case, no costs can be
reimbursed for activities that took place before the project starting
date/proposal submission).
• No-profit rule — Grants may NOT give a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU
grant over costs). This will be checked by us at the end of the project.
• No cumulation of funding/no double funding — It is strictly prohibited to
cumulate funding from the EU budget (except under ‘EU Synergies actions’).
Outside such Synergies actions, any given action may receive only ONE grant
from the EU budget and cost items may under NO circumstances be declared
under two EU grants; projects must be designed as different actions, clearly
delineated and separated for each grant (without overlaps).
• Combination with EU operating grants — Combination with EU operating
grants is possible, if the project remains outside the operating grant work
programme and you make sure that cost items are clearly separated in your
accounting and NOT declared twice (see AGA — Annotated Model Grant
Agreement, art 6.2.E).
• Multiple proposals — Applicants may submit more than one proposal for
different projects under the same call (and be awarded a funding for them).
Organisations may participate in several proposals.
BUT: if there are several proposals for very similar projects, only one application
will be accepted and evaluated; the applicants will be asked to withdraw one of
them (or it will be rejected).
• Resubmission — Proposals may be changed and re-submitted until the
deadline for submission.
• Rejection — By submitting the application, all applicants accept the call
conditions set out in this this Call document (and the documents it refers to).
Proposals that do not comply with all the call conditions will be rejected. This
applies also to applicants: All applicants need to fulfil the criteria; if any one of
them doesn’t, they must be replaced, or the entire proposal will be rejected.
• Cancellation — There may be circumstances which may require the
cancellation of the call. In this case, you will be informed via a call or topic
update. Please note that cancellations are without entitlement to compensation.

criminal matters
EU Grants: Call document (JUST): V1.0 – 22.11.2024
• Language — You can submit your proposal in any official EU language (project
abstract/summary should however always be in English). For reasons of
efficiency, we strongly advise you to use English for the entire application. If
you need the call documentation in another official EU language, please submit
a request within 10 days after call publication (for the contact information, see
section 12).
• Transparency — In accordance with Article 38 of the EU Financial Regulation,
information about EU grants awarded is published each year on the Europa
website.
This includes:
− beneficiary names
− beneficiary addresses
− the purpose for which the grant was awarded
− the maximum amount awarded.
The publication can exceptionally be waived (on reasoned and duly substantiated
request), if there is a risk that the disclosure could jeopardise your rights and
freedoms under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights or harm your commercial
interests.
• Data protection — The submission of a proposal under this call involves the
collection, use and processing of personal data. This data will be processed in
accordance with Regulation 2018/1725. It will be processed solely for the
purpose of evaluating your proposal, subsequent management of your grant
and, if needed, programme monitoring, evaluation, and communication. Details
are explained in the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy Statement.

How to manage your lump sum grants
Lump sum proposal submission, evaluation and grant management in EU
programmes
Version 1.2
15 July 2024EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
IMPORTANT NOTICE
This document is designed to help applicants and beneficiaries submit their lump sum proposals
and manage their lump sum grants in EU funding programmes.
Lump sum grants are grants where the grant amount is fixed and will be paid out if the project is
implemented as set out in the description of the action (DoA).
These types of grants are simpler in the implementation than the actual cost grants that are typically
used in EU programmes, since they require less administration and no cost reporting.
There are 3 types of lump sums:
− Type 1: pre-fixed amount (defined ex ante by granting authority general decision ‘lump
sum authorising decision’)
− Type 1a: pre-fixed total for certain project types (meaning that the lump sum will be the
same for all projects under a call)
− Type 1b: pre-fixed building block amounts for certain activities (meaning that the lump
sum will be based on the same amounts per activity, but may vary from project to project
depending on the activities selected)
− Type 2: project-based amount (lump sum methodology set out in a granting authority
‘lump sum authorising decision’, but details based on individual project budget, i.e. different
for each project).
The lump sum type that applies is set out in the call conditions/programme guide/work programme.
You can consult the lump sum methodologies for each programme in the Portal Reference Documents.
The guiding principle is that lump sum funding follows, wherever possible, the standard rules and
processes for actual cost grants. This document focusses on the limited number of aspects that are
different in lump sum calls. For all other aspects, refer to the general eGrants guidance.
For more information and visuals, please refer to the presentation Lump Sum Funding: What do I
need to know.

3EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
1. Writing a lump sum proposal
Proposal design
To write a proposal under a topic using lump sum funding, you must use the standard proposal
templates for the EU programme you are applying for. You will find the template to be used
directly in the online Submission System.
You present the objectives and methodology of your project and address the expected outcomes
and impacts as in any EU grant proposal.
The design of your work plan is essentially the same as in any proposal, except that work
packages with a long duration (e.g., management, communication, dissemination and
exploitation, etc) may be split along the reporting periods. In this way, the relevant activities
can be paid at the end of each reporting period (may be important for the cash flow in your
project). The effectiveness of the work plan remains howver essential. The use of lump sum
funding should NOT lead to the subdivision of the project into many small work packages.
You are encouraged to indicate your preferred reporting periods as part of the work plan. Please
respect the minimum number of reporting periods required for the programme/type of
action/topic (if any; e.g. 1 RP of 18 months in Horizon Europe). The final decision on the
reporting periods will be taken during grant preparation. It will follow your proposal unless
changes are needed (e.g. to mitigate risks or to minimise the number of reporting periods).
As usual, your proposal must describe in detail the activities covered by each work package.
Budget structure and cost estimations
Lump sum budgets are based on cost estimations (either upfront by the EU granting authority
or in the proposal by the applicants).
Thus:
− where the lump sum is prefixed by the call (lump sum type 1a), your budget must equal
(add up to) the prefixed total
− where the lump sum is based on pre-fixed building block amounts for certain activities
(lump sum type 1b), you will be expected to fill out a calculator, to show how you arrived
at the total amount
− where the lump sum is project-based (lump sum type 2), you will have to submit a
detailed budget table with the project budget.
In the lump sum type 2 detailed budget table, you must provide realistic cost estimations for
each cost category (personnel costs, subcontracting costs, purchase costs, other cost
categories) per beneficiary and affiliated entity (if any), and per work package.
These cost estimations and the resources you commit to mobilise will be the basis to define and
justify the lump sum; they will add up to the total lump sum amount that you propose.
Keep in mind that for this type of lump sum, the cost estimations must be an approximation of
your actual costs. They must be:
− in line with the same eligibility rules as in actual costs grants of the programme, i.e. cost
estimations can be included only if the same cost item/type of cost would be eligible in
an actual cost grant (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art. 6*)
− in line with your normal practices
− reasonable/not excessive
4EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
− in line with and necessary for the activities proposed.
For Horizon Europe: If your organisation is using the HE personnel unit costs (see Decision on
HE and Euratom personnel unit costs), you must use the approved daily rate to estimate the
personnel costs. The monthly rate in the detailed budget table must be calculated using this
formula: Monthly rate = Approved daily rate x (215/12).
The templates to be used are available in the online Submission System.
2. Evaluation
Your proposal will be evaluated by an evaluation committee (in many programmes with
involvement of independent external experts), against the standard award criteria of the EU
programme concerned.
The evaluators will assess the cost estimations against the proposed activities under one of the
award criteria (e.g. for HE under ‘Quality and efficiency of the implementation’; DEP, EDF under
‘Implementation’; SMP, CREA, ERASMUS under ‘Quality’; LIFE under ‘Resources’). They will
ensure that cost estimations are reasonable and non-excessive and whether the resources
proposed and the budget-split of lump sum shares will allow completing the activities as
described in the proposal.
For Horizon Europe: A personnel cost dashboard will provide the evaluators with reference data
about the range of normal personnel costs in Horizon Europe, per country and per type of
organisation, helping them to judge if personnel cost estimations in a proposal are reasonable.
If you have high personnel costs, especially personnel costs above the values shown in this
dashboard, please justify them in the comment tab of your detailed budget table. For more
details, see the landing page of the personnel cost dashboard and the instructions in the detailed
budget table.
Cost estimations that are clearly overestimated or underestimated will lead to a decreased score
under the award criterion concerned.
Moreover, evaluators can make specific recommendations on the lump sum shares and the
underlying costs estimations. They can recommend:
− to decrease the lump sum amount for a work package/beneficiary
− to reallocate lump sum shares among work package/beneficiaries.
Following the recommendations of the evaluators, the requested grant amount might be
decreased. The requested grant amount can NOT be increased.
Like in actual cost grants, you will receive feedback on your proposal.
If your proposal is ranked on the main list or reserve list:
− comments on the detailed budget table will be provided in the evaluation summary report
(ESR) and
− budget cuts or budget transfers between beneficiaries and/or between work packages
decided during the evaluation (if any) will be explained with sufficient detail for you to
implement them during grant preparation.
If your proposal is ranked below threshold/below the available budget there will normally not be
any detailed comments on the lump sum budget, unless your proposal is rejected, at least in
part, due to a flawed budget (e.g., a significantly overestimated or underestimated lump sum).
The evaluation result letter (ERL) will reflect budget cuts decided during the evaluation, if any.
5EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
3. Grant preparation
If your lump sum proposal is selected for funding, the standard process will be followed to
prepare the grant agreement in the online Grant Management System. The grant agreement for
your project will be based on the Model Grant Agreement for Lump Sum Grants.
The ‘no negotiation’ principle applies. Proposals are evaluated based on merit and not on their
potential if certain improvements were made. This means that your proposal is taken ‘as is’. The
grant agreement will be prepared on the basis of the proposal you submitted. However, some
changes might be necessary.
Apart from possible budget changes (see below), the changes you may introduce during grant
agreement preparation (GAP) should be limited to:
− correcting obvious errors and inconsistencies
− other changes necessary to comply with applicable rules.
You cannot introduce changes to the scope or to the objectives of your proposal that would call
in question the fair treatment of all other applicants; changes to the consortium are exceptionally
possible, if needed (e.g. a partner becomes bankrupt or can no longer participate).
Following the result of the evaluation and the recommendations of experts, the overall lump
sum is fixed in the grant agreement. The breakdown of lump sum shares per beneficiary and
per work package is also included in the grant agreement as Annex 2. The calculator/detailed
lump sum budget table will however NOT become part of the lump sum grant agreement.
Once the lump sum is fixed in the grant agreement, it will not be questioned (even if prices for
goods or services change later on).
Budget changes documented in the ESR (if any)
The overall lump sum must be adjusted to the amount specified in the evaluation result letter
(ERL), if applicable.
This should be done by adapting the lump sum shares and the information on costs and
resources in line with the ESR (e.g. for HE, you make the necessary adjustments in the detailed
budget table; it will result in a updated breakdown of lump sum shares which you can use to fill
Annex 2).
Cost items that were flagged during evaluation as doubtful or potentially overestimated will be
specifically followed up during GAP by the project officer/financial officer. You will be invited to
provide further justification for the amounts in question and if not accepted you will have to
adjust them. This may lead to a lower amount than the one specified in the ERL andthus to a
lower grant.
Budget changes not documented in the ESR (exceptional)
Changes to the lump sum budget that are not documented in the ESR are exceptionally possible,
if they are necessary to comply with the rules (e.g. in case of ineligible costs that were not
detected during evaluation). Your project officer will inform you of such changes, if any.
Ethics work package (if applicable)
If the ethics review leads to ethics deliverables (e.g. for HE, DEP, etc), they are added to the
grant agreement during GAP. Ethics deliverables, if any, are contained in an automatically
generated work package called ‘Ethics requirements’. No staff effort can be attached to this work
package, and it does not change the maximum grant amount. This applies to all grants.
6EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
In lump sum grants, the additional ‘Ethics requirements’ work package appears in Annex 2 with
no budget (i.e. with a lump sum share of EUR 0).
Part B of the description of action (DoA)
To produce the Part B of the description of action (i.e. Part B of Annex 1 of the grant agreement),
you must start from the Part B of your proposal.
You should in principle follow the same instructions as for actual costs grants, except for the
tables with information on individual costs.
For Horizon Europe: Please remove the following tables (they are not needed in lump sum
grants):
− Table 3.1.h (Purchase costs)
− Table 3.1.i (Other costs categories)
− Table 3.1.j (In-kind contributions provided by third parties).
These 3 tables should not become part of the lump sum grant agreement.
4. Grant amendments
The grant agreement can be amended, except where those changes would call into question the
decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. The
procedure to launch an amendment is the same as that for actual costs grants.
For lump sum grants signed under the previous programming period 2014-2020 (e.g. H2020),
a review must be organised to confirm that the amendment does not call into question the
decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. This
obligation is no longer applicable for the new programmes 2021-2027 (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, etc).
Amending work packages and work plan
You can introduce changes to individual work packages and to the work plan through an
amendment. However, work packages that have already been completed and paid cannot be
amended.
All other parts and aspects of the lump sum grant agreement can be amended in the same way
as for actual cost grants. This includes:
− extension of the project duration
− change of reporting periods
− changes in the work plan (change of Annex 1, e.g. work packages, tasks, deliverables)
− transfer of activities between beneficiaries
− new/additional activities to be subcontracted
− adding or removing beneficiaries, affiliated entities or associated partners.
Changes to the work plan may or may not require budget transfers, which require an update of
the breakdown of lump sum shares (Annex 2).
Instead of a formal amendment, deviations from the work plan can be flagged in the periodic
report (simplified approval procedure) and be accepted as part of the reporting procedure (see
section 5.2).
7EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
The detailed lump sum budget table is part of the proposal (see section 1), but not part of the
grant agreement. Therefore, this table is not updated after the grant is signed, including when
the grant agreement is amended.
Budget transfers
The consortium is free to spend the lump sum as they see fit, provided the project is carried out
as described in the grant agreement.
The granting authority will assume distribution in accordance with the lump sum budget table,
e.g. for the purpose of offsetting. Therefore, it might be in your interest to formalise changes to
the budget via an amendment.
If you would like to formalise a change in the breakdown of the lump sum shares (Annex 2),
this requires an amendment.
Such budget transfers may be done:
− within the same work package (i.e. increasing the share of one beneficiary and
decreasing the share of another) and/or
− between work packages (i.e. increasing the share allocated to one work package and
decreasing the share of another).
You need to justify these changes on the basis of the technical implementation of the action.
Transfers from or to a work package which has already been declared completed and paid in a
preceding reporting period are NOT allowed.
Addition or termination of a beneficiary
The addition or termination of a beneficiary always requires an amendment. The amendment
must include an updated breakdown of lump sum shares (Annex 2) that reflects the modified
consortium. The overall lump sum can NOT change.
The modified consortium maintains collective responsibility to implement the action as described
in the grant agreement.
The addition or termination of a beneficiary will normally require budget transfers that are
introduced in the same amendment.
The new beneficiary does not have to complete the calculator/detailed budget table. An updated
breakdown of lump sum shares (Annex 2) is sufficient.
For the beneficiary termination report and the amount due to terminated beneficiaries, see
section 6.
5. Monitoring, reporting and payments
5.1 Monitoring and project reviews
The obligation to properly implement the action is the same for all EU grants, including lump
sum grants. For details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art. 11).
At the end of a reporting period (or at any other time we consider necessary), we can organise
a project progress review. The review will monitor the proper implementation of the action as
compared to the work described in the description of action (Annex 1). It will be based on the
deliverables, milestones and technical periodic reports. Like for actual cost grants, the review
can also focus on the compliance with other aspects of the grant. However, in lump sum grants
a project review will not focus on financial and budgetary aspects.
8EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
5.2 Periodic reporting
At the end of each reporting period, you need to submit the technical and financial report in the
Periodic Reporting module of the online Grant Management System. The approach is the same
as for actual costs grants except that in lump sum grants:
− the coordinator must complete the ‘status of work packages’ table in the Grant
Management System and mark work packages as ‘completed’ or ‘not completed’
− the technical report should focus on the completion of work packages (in particular, when
you declare a work package as completed, the report must explain and justify this)
− the financial report is much simplified and to a large extent automated.
The reporting process for lump sum grants is described below and in the Funding & Tenders
Portal IT How To section on Lump Sum Reporting.
You must use the standard technical periodic report template available directly in the Grant
Management System. The ‘use of resources’ report will however not be required for lump sum
grants.
The technical report should detail who did what (at the level of the participating organisations,
not at the level of individual staff), indicating the contributions from beneficiaries, affiliated
entities, associated partners, and subcontractors.
On the basis of the status of the work packages and the amounts of lump sum shares attributed
to each beneficiary in the grant agreement, the consolidated financial statement will be
automatically generated for all beneficiaries. Certificates on financial statements are not used in
lump sum grants.
You have no contractual obligation to keep financial records for the project. There is no reporting
of actual costs or of resources.
Declaring work packages as completed
Work packages1 should be completed as described in Annex 1.
In some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe), they will be assessed on the basis of the activities
carried out, irrespective of the results obtained or objectives achieved; in other programmes
(and depending on the description in Annex 1), they may be assessed on the basis of achieving
specified outputs or results.
While a work package can normally only be declared as completed when all the work has been
carried out as described, it can also be declared as completed if some elements are missing, as
long as:
− all essential work has been completed and/or
− equivalent work has been carried out and/or
− when deviations have been duly justified.
The work to be completed includes the activities described as part of the objectives, milestones,
and deliverables that are linked to the work package (if any).
1 Work packages describe the activities to be caried out and/or the outputs or results to be achieved. The description
of activities may be broken down into tasks. Note that “activities” and “work” are used synonymously in this
document (e.g., “activities carried out” and “work done” mean the same).
9EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
In programmes where work packages are assessed based on the activities carried out (e.g.
Horizon Europe):
− reaching objectives and milestones successfully is desirable but not a requirement for
completion of the work package
− normally, all deliverables must be completed, meaning that the underlying work has been
done and the deliverable reports have been submitted and accepted, while a successful
outcome is not required
− exceptionally, deliverables can be modified or delayed if the deviation has been duly
justified.
Incomplete work packages can be finished and declared later on, in any of the subsequent
reporting periods.
If the implementation of your project deviated from the work plan for technical reasons, and a
work package cannot be completed as described in the grant agreement:
− you can report the deviation in the dedicated section of the technical report; if duly
justified, the deviation can be accepted with the technical report
− alternatively, you can introduce an amendment to address the situation, with the aim of
making the completion of the work package feasible (see section 4). For example, you
can propose a feasible alternative to the initial work package description, based on
equivalent work that can be carried out. The assessment of your report will be based on
the latest version of the grant agreement, meaning that an amendment must be
completed before the assessment of your report, in order to be taken into account.
If several beneficiaries carry out a work package, they cannot declare it as completed until all
of them have completed it.
Exceptionally, at the end of the last reporting period, you have the possibility to declare a work
package as partially completed (see below). In this case, you need to indicate a percentage of
completion. You should declare work packages as partially completed if essential parts have not
been carried out and not been replaced with equivalent work. This needs to be explained and
justified in the final technical report. The percentage of completion declared should correspond
to the share of activities described in the grant agreement that have been carried out. The
degree of completion is not linked to cost expenditure or use of resources.
Assessment of lump sum work packages
The project officer will assess the technical report and the status of work packages. For each
work package declared, the project officer will assess and choose between ‘completed’ and ‘not
completed’. At the final report, the project officer can also choose ‘partially completed’ and enter
the percentage of completion.
The project officer will reject a work package when a significant or essential part of the work
has not been completed, and this deviation from the work plan is not justified or not acceptable.
If the project officer intends to reject a work package, you will have the opportunity to react to
the observations of the project officer. In this case, the project officer will either send you a
request for additional information or reject the technical report and ask you to justify the
completion of the work package(s).
5.3 Payments
Payments follow the standard schedule: a prefinancing payment, additional pre-financing
payments (in some grant schemes), interim payments at the end of each reporting period, and
a final payment of the balance.
10EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
The calculation of the prefinancing follows the standard rules and is fixed in the grant agreement.
For programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (e.g. HE), a small percentage of the lump
sum will be retained as contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism. The coordinator of your
project should distribute the prefinancing in accordance with your consortium agreement.
Interim payments pay the lump sum shares for work packages completed during the
corresponding reporting period and accepted by the project officer in charge of your project.
There is no possibility for interim payment of partially completed work packages.
Before a lump sum work package is rejected as incomplete, you will be invited to respond to the
observations of the project officer and explain why it should be accepted. If the rejection is
upheld, the lump sum share concerned will not paid at that interim payment. In this case, you
should complete the work package and declare it again at the end of any subsequent reporting
period. If accepted, the corresponding lump sum share will then be paid.
The payment of the balance pays the remaining lump sum shares for the implementation of the
action.
Partial payments for partially completed work packages
Payments for partially completed work packages are possible only at the end of the project, as
part of the payment of the balance.
You are expected to complete all work packages by the end of the project. If needed, make use
of the possibilities to justify deviations and/or to amend the grant. The meaning of ‘completed
work package’ is defined above (see section 5.2).
If it is not possible to complete a work package by the end of the project due to technical reasons
or force majeure, you may declare a partial work package. In this case, the lump sum share is
paid partially, in line with the accepted degree of completion. This means that the amount
reimbursed will correspond to the accepted part of the work package, which may be less than
the part you declared as completed. If you declare a work package incomplete at the end of the
project due to other reasons, the work package may be rejected in full.
Examples (acceptable partial WPs):
1. A work package cannot be completed because the underlying method does not work as planned.
Despite best efforts, no feasible alternative method became available.
2. A key member of staff is no longer able to work on the project (e.g. due to resignation, parental
leave, or long sick leave). Without the expertise of this person, the activities of a work package cannot
be finished, and it is not possible to replace the person within a reasonable time frame.
3. There is a serious supply problem on the market, and it is no longer possible to buy essential
consumables needed to perform the analysis of environmental samples as described in the grant
agreement. The missing components cannot be replaced, and alternative analytical methods do not
provide the required sensitivity. As a result, the work package concerned cannot be completed.
4. A beneficiary requests terminating its participation in the action because a fire devastated its
laboratory where most of the technical equipment and computers used for the project were located.
This is a case of force majeure where the beneficiary cannot complete its work in the project. Against
this background, the work packages concerned are accepted in part (in proportion to the work carried
out).
Examples (non-acceptable partial WPs):
1. Beneficiaries A, B and C are involved in a work package. At the end of the project, this work package
is declared as partially completed. While A and B fully completed their work, C completed its work only
partially. The technical assessment of the work done reveals that C wilfully stopped collaborating in
the project and that the partial work done was not performed according to the state-of-the-art carbon-
neutral method described in the grant agreement. C has special know-how for this method and was
included in the project for this particular reason. Against this background, only the lump sum shares
of A and B are paid. The contribution of C is considered non-implemented and is rejected.
2. The consortium argues that they did not have enough time to complete the work package. The delay
was not previously reported, there is no proper justification, and there was no clear effort to manage
11EU Grants: How to manage your lump sum grants: V1.2 – 15.07.2024
it (e.g. no attempt to speed up or to address the situation through an amendment). Against this
background, the work package is rejected in full.
3. The project turned out to be more expensive than budgeted, and the consortium stopped the work
in one or more work packages. The consortium did not report and justify the problem and made no
effort to resolve it (e.g. through an amendment). Against this background, the partially completed
work packages concerned are rejected.
The procedure for the partial payment of work packages has changed. For grants signed under
the 2014-2020 programming period, the partial lump sum share to be reimbursed for a partially
completed work package is determined in a grant reduction process, with a contradictory
procedure on the reduction. For the current programming period(2021-2027), the incomplete
work package will be partially rejected (and the lump sum share for that work package also
automatically partially rejected). Beneficiaries have the possibility to submit observations during
a contradictory procedure (if the rejection leads to a recovery) or after the rejection (if it does
not lead to a recovery).
6. Beneficiary termination reporting
In case the participation of a partner is terminated, you will not be required to provide any
financial reports because the amount due will be calculated only on the basis of work packages
already previously accepted. Any amounts for work packages not yet accepted, on which the
terminated partner worked before the termination, will be paid out to the coordinator once the
work package is accepted in a following reporting and payment session.
The amendment terminating the partner (or any other subsequent amendment) will determine
the redistribution of activities and the remaining budget assigned to the terminated beneficiary
in Annex 2.
7. Checks, reviews and audits
The rules for checks, reviews, audits and investigations of lump sum grants are the same as for
actual cost grants, as far as horizontal obligations and technical project implementation is
concerned.
As there is no financial reporting, there are no financial checks, reviews or audits related to
actual costs and the resources used.
Controls can focus on the proper implementation of the work plan (of the activities) and on non-
financial obligations. This includes compliance with rules on intellectual property, ethics and
integrity, visibility of EU funding, etc.
8. Record keeping
You have no contractual obligation to keep financial records for the project. There is no reporting
of actual costs or of resources. You will only need to comply with record keeping and other legal
obligations outside the lump sum grant agreement, if any (e.g. under national law or internal
procedures).
You must keep documentation to demonstrate that the activities in Annex 1 have been carried
out, and by whom. This is the same technical documentation as for all grants (i.e. there is no
additional technical documentation to be kept specifically for lump sum grants). For example,
for research activities, you should keep documentation as required by good research practices
such as lab books, technical documents, prototypes, proceedings in conferences, and
publications.
12DECISION authorising the use of lump sums for actions under the Justice Programme
2021-2027
1Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to the Justice Programme1, and in particular Article 7 thereof, as well as
Recital 27
Having regard to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the
Union2, and in particular Articles 125 and 181 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The actions financed under the Justice programme are homogenous and standardised
and cover recuring activities such as trainings, meetings and IT developments
moreover the outputs actions are tangible and quantifiable. Therefore lump sum
funding is particularly suited for the actions funded under the Justice Programme.
(2) The use of lump sum costs will simplify the calculation of reimbursement of these
actions costs, significantly decreasing the workload and reducing the administrative
burden/costs of both the beneficiaries and the Commission as well as accelerate
payment procedures and allow to focus on the outputs and deliverables
(3) The use of lump sums should therefore be authorised for the listed actions financed
under the Justice Programme,
THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN DECIDED:
Sole Article
The use of the Union contribution in the form of lump sum contributions is authorised for
actions under the Justice programme 2021-2027, for the reasons and under the conditions set
out in the Annex.
Done at Brussels,
Director General
Ana Gallego
1 OJ L 156/21, 5.5.2021, p. 21-38.

2Annex
1. Form of Union contribution and categories of costs covered
The Union contribution for Judicial Training, Judicial Cooperation and Access to Justice
actions under the Justice programme (2021-2027) shall exclusively take the form of lump sum
contributions for the following categories of eligible costs:
Personnel costs:
- Employees (or equivalent)
- Natural persons working under direct contract
- Seconded persons by a third party against payment
- SME owners and natural person beneficiaries
- Volunteer costs
Subcontracting costs
Purchase costs:
- Travel and subsistence costs
- Equipment (depreciation);
- Other goods, works and services
Other cost categories:
- Financial support to third parties (if any)
The lump sum contribution will be determined for each grant by the granting authority on the
basis of the following principles:
(a) The lump sum contribution must be an approximation of the beneficiaries underlying
actual costs;
(b) The applicants must propose the amount of the lump sum contribution on the basis of their
estimated direct and indirect project costs and in accordance with the method described in
point 3;
(c) The proposal must show the costs and categories of costs covered by the lump sum
contribution, may contain only costs that would be eligible for an actual costs grant and must
exclude costs that are ineligible under the Justice rules.
2. Justification
The use of lump sums will reduce the administrative burden in particular for beneficiaries and
reduce the scope for error in the cost claims, will speed up the payment process and ensure an
effective risk control, while focusing on the quality of the results.
In particular, the use of lump sums implies a reduction in administrative costs for participation
in the Programme and contributes to the prevention and reduction of financial errors (i.e. staff
cost calculations…). It also simplifies the calculation of grant amounts while decreasing
significantly the workload of both the beneficiaries and the granting authority (i.e. complexity
of verification of real costs through underlying supporting documents) thereby ensuring
payment procedures are accelerated and allowing DG Justice and Consumers project officers
to focus more on the project results.
3This system provides legal certainty to beneficiaries and is expected to contribute to better
quality applications, as the outputs of individual co-financed projects are tangible, qualifiable,
and quantifiable (they include translations, events, festivals, concerts, performances,
exhibitions, fairs, publications, mobilities, training events, conferences, video games
prototypes, audio-visual works, …).
Finally, the use of lump sum will facilitate wider access to EU funding because the rules for
participation, implementation and reporting will be simpler than the classical budget based
mechanism.
2.1. Nature of the supported actions
The Programme has the general objective of contributing to the further development of a
European area of justice based on the rule of law including the independence and impartiality
of the judiciary, on mutual recognition and mutual trust, and on judicial cooperation thereby
also strengthening democracy, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights.
The actions financed under the Justice programme are standard, funding covers recuring
activities such as trainings, meetings and IT developments and the average value of a grant
did not vary significantly over the years. Projects outputs are easily identifiable and priceable.
Due to the homogenous nature of the actions funded, using a lump-sum contribution is
justified. The costs of the actions can be well-estimated on the basis of the historical data.
This decision will apply to all action grants under the the following specific objectives:
Judicial Cooperation
The actions support projects aiming at facilitating and supporting judicial cooperation in civil
and criminal matters, and promoting the rule of law, independence and impartiality of the
judiciary, including by supporting the efforts to improve the effectiveness of national justice
systems, and the effective enforcement of decisions.
The activities financed consist mainly in meetings, mutual learning, exchange of best
practices, trainings, capacity building for professionals, development of information tools,
dissemination and awareness-raising, analytical activities, IT software development.
Judicial Training
The actions support projects aiming at contributing to the effective and coherent application
of EU law in the areas of civil law, criminal law and fundamental rights, as enshrined in the
EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the rule of law related issues, by helping to address
the training needs of justice professionals in these fields.
The activities financed consist mainly in the organisation of interactive, practice-oriented
seminars, multilateral exchanges between justice professionals, cross-border training activities
and joint study visits to European courts and in the creation of training material, innovative
online trainings and tools or activities for training providers.
Access to Justice” (including e-Justice)
4The actions support projects aiming at facilitating effective and non-discriminatory access to
justice for all, and effective redress, including by electronic means (e-justice), by promoting
efficient civil, and criminal procedures, and by promoting and supporting the rights of all
victims of crime, as well as the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal
proceedings.
The activities financed consist mainly in meetings, mutual learning, exchange of best
practices, trainings, capacity building for professionals, development of information and
educational tools, dissemination and awareness-raising, analytical activities, IT software
development and establishment of new IT systems.
Risks of irregularities and fraud and costs of control
The risk of errors and irregularities is lower in relation to the use of real costs because there is
no reporting of actual costs. Beneficiaries have no obligation to include the costs incurred for
the action with payment requests.
The lump sums are output-based, and therefore the main condition for payment is the
achievement of pre-defined outputs. The outputs are proposed by the applicants in their
proposals as detailed below point 3. The granting authority will undertake checks at the time
of preparation of the grant, during the implementation of the action and at the completion of
the actions (through reports from funded projects, checks on milestones and deliverables
and/or reviews).
The risk of fraud and the cost of controls of the triggering event, for the lump sum payment,
are limited, since the proper implementation of the action is clearly defined and output-based.
If the conditions for payment of the lump sum contributions have not been met, (e.g. a
particular work package has not been completed or only partially completed), the granting
authority will be entitled to reject or partially reject the work package.
Checks and reviews will instead focus on achievement of results and the proper
implementation of the action, in particular on the fulfilment of the essential conditions for
triggering payment of the lump sum contribution per work package.
3. Method to determine the amount of the lump sum
3.1. Grant proposal
Applicants will provide an estimated budget for the work to be carried out under the action
(using the submission form template).
Applicants must provide in their proposals a breakdown of the lump sum showing the share
per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary);
The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;
It may include only costs that would be eligible for an actual costs grant and must exclude
costs that are ineligible under the Justice programme.
Indirect costs should be calculated by applying a flat rate of 7% to the direct cost;
The co-financing rate will be applied to the total estimated eligible costs, using the funding
rate set out in the call for proposals.
53.2. Evaluation
Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of
internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the proposal against the usual award
criteria: relevance, quality and impact.
Experts will have the necessary financial know-how and will check the estimated budget and
verify whether the resources proposed, and the split of work packages, allow for the
achievement of the activities and expected outputs. For each work package, the estimated
budget will be assessed for accuracy and suitability of the resources proposed and whether the
split of lump sum shares allow for achieving the activities and expected outputs, to be attained
in the light of the proposed resources.
The experts will consult statistical, historical or any other appropriate data on costs and
resources from previously comparable funded projects provided by the granting authority in
order to benchmark the proposed costs, and will check that the correct indirect cost and co-
financing rate have been correctly applied.
They might propose to remove some ineligible costs and/or actions from the proposal.
3.3. Determination of the lump sum amount
Following the evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sums
taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out (including the recommendations
from the evaluation committee). If costs or activities items need to be adapted, the lump sums
and the lump sums breakdown are modified accordingly during grant preparation.
The final lump sum is included in the grant agreement as the maximum grant amount. It is
calculated by applying the reimbursement rate set out in the call for proposals to the total
estimated eligible costs in the detailed budget table.
4. Sound financial management and co-financing principles and absence of double
funding
The methodology described in Section 3 complies with the principles of sound financial
management, co-financing and absence of double funding as required by the Financial
Regulation.
Sound financial management is ensured because the cost estimate in the grant proposal is
detailed and subject to an in-depth check by the evaluation committee to ensure it represents
an approximation of actual eligible costs as described in points 3.1 and 3.2.
Co-financing is ensured by applying the reimbursement rates set out in the calls for proposals.
The absence of double funding can be ensured by clearly identifying in the call and in the
grant all categories of eligible and ineligible costs and activities covered, and subsequently by
checking the overlaps with other grants awarded to the same beneficiary through eGrants.

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES AND
OTHER PARTICIPANTS
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting
authority for implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance
with all the obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action
under their own responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated
entities or other participants (see Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the
granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the
beneficiaries fails to implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure
that this part is implemented by someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the
maximum grant amount and subject to an amendment; see Article 39). The financial
responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding
the grant for the entire duration of the action. Lump sum contributions will be eligible only as
long as the beneficiary and the action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see
Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the
implementation of the action (see Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the prefinancing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
19Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements
(CFS): not applicable
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article
21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority
under the Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their
affiliated entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and
the granting authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies
otherwise, and in particular:
- submit the prefinancing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify
their quality and completeness before passing them on to the granting
authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other
beneficiaries (report on the distribution of payments; if required, see
Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other
beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other
beneficiary or third party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii)
last indent and (iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have
created or which are controlled by or affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains
sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance with the obligations under the
Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’16 (or similar, such as European research
infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to
16
For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy
the criteria for being awarded a grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole
beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the purpose of implementing the action
financed by the grant.”

EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
one of their members. The coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the
obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-
ordination, to ensure that the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of
recoveries (if any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article
16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION for programmes with linked actions: [OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked
actions, the beneficiaries must have arrangements with the participants of the other action,
to ensure that both actions are implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the
consortium is the same, as part of their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of
outputs, common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy
activities, common communication and dissemination activities, sharing of
information, access to background and results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in
both actions.
The arrangements with the participants of the other action must not contain any provision
contrary to this Agreement.]]

10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
[OPTION 1 for programmes without pillar-assessed entities: Not applicable]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with pillar-assessed entities: Pillar-assessed participants (if any)
may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in so far as they have been positively
assessed and do not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle
of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and
procedures which participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control
system, accounting system, external audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and
exclusion, information on recipients and protection of personal data; see Article 157 EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
18 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of
annual accounts and consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
25Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and
procedures, in particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards,
rules and procedures
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in
accordance with usual accounting practices
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, prefinancing guarantees are not
needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their
regular internal or external auditors and in accordance with their internal
financial regulations and procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if
those practices are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no
recovery if the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue
amounts from the third party receiving the support (including legal proceedings)
and non-recovery is not due to an error or negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be
conducted taking into account the rules and procedures specifically agreed
between them and the framework agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the
participant’s internal rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment
will be calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into
before the pre-information letter was received and could not reasonably be
terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated
for damage it sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because
the action was not implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the
damage is due to an infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures
or due to a violation of third parties’ rights by the participant or one of its
employees or individual for whom the employees are responsible.

EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do
purchases, subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance
with their internal rules and procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal
standards, rules and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the
grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use),
communication, dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems,
rules and procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules
and procedures that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately
inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU,
may moreover — under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the
decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries) — rely on the provisions set out in that framework agreement. ]

20.1 Keeping records and supporting documents
The beneficiaries must — at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6) —
keep records and other supporting documents to prove the proper implementation of the
action (proper implementation of the work and/or achievement of the results as described in
Annex 1) in line with the accepted standards in the respective field (if any); beneficiaries do
not need to keep specific records on the actual costs incurred.
The records and supporting documents must be made available upon request (see Article 19)

36Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- for additional prefinancings (if any): an additional prefinancing report
- for interim payments (if any) and the final payment: a periodic report.
The prefinancing and periodic reports include a technical and financial part.
The technical part includes an overview of the action implementation. It must be prepared
using the template available in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool.
The financial part of the additional prefinancing report includes a statement on the use of the
previous prefinancing payment.
The financial part of the periodic report includes:
- the financial statement (consolidated statement for the consortium)
- the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table): not
applicable
- the certificates on the financial statements (CFS): not applicable.
The financial statement must contain the lump sum contributions indicated in Annex 2, for
the work packages that were completed during the reporting period.
For the last reporting period, the beneficiaries may exceptionally also declare partial lump
sum contributions for work packages that were not completed (e.g. due to force majeure or
technical impossibility).
Lump sum contributions which are not declared in a financial statement will not be taken into
account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statement (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the
coordinator confirms (on behalf of the consortium) that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the lump sum contributions declared are eligible (in particular, the work packages
have been completed, that the work has been properly implemented and/or the results
were achieved in accordance with Annex 1; see Article 6)
- the proper implementation and/or achievement can be substantiated by adequate
records and supporting documents (see Article 20) that will be produced upon
request (see Article 19) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits and investigations
(see Article 25).
In case of recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the lump
sum contributions declared for their affiliated entities (if any).
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
The financial statements must be drafted in euro.

21.4 Reporting language
The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
21.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a report submitted does not comply with this Article, the granting authority may suspend
the payment deadline (see Article 29) and apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the
grant or the coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in
Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 22 — PAYMENTS AND RECOVERIES — CALCULATION OF
AMOUNTS DUE
22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.2) and must be distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to
distribution of the initial prefinancing payment; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment
obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date
when they are debited to its account.
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it
turns out that the granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts
undue.
[OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: The general
liability regime for recoveries (first-line liability) is as follows: At final payment, the
coordinator will be fully liable for recoveries, even if it has not been the final recipient of the
undue amounts. At beneficiary termination or after final payment, recoveries will be made
directly against the beneficiaries concerned.
Beneficiaries will be fully liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities.
38Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4):
- the beneficiaries will be jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of another
beneficiary under the Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
- affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of their beneficiaries under the
Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority
(see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
[OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: Each
beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is in principle limited to their own
debt and undue amounts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4), affiliated entities will be held liable for
repaying debts of their beneficiaries, if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.4).]
22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Prefinancing payments
The aim of the prefinancing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
For additional prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous
prefinancing payment shows that less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data
Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the 70% threshold and the amount used.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The contribution to the
Mutual Insurance Mechanism will be retained from the prefinancing payments (at the rate and
in accordance with the modalities set out in the Data Sheet, see Point 4.2) and transferred to
the Mechanism.]
Prefinancing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent)
against amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to
that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
In case of beneficiary termination, the granting authority will determine the provisional
amount due for the beneficiary concerned.
39Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
This will be done on the basis of work packages already completed in previous interim
payments. Payments for ongoing/not yet completed work packages which the beneficiary was
working on before termination (if any) will therefore be made only later on, with the next
interim or final payments when those work packages have been completed.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary,
on the basis of the beneficiary’s lump sum contributions for the work packages which were
approved in previous interim payments
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the
distribution of payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments received (if any)}}.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this
amount to be paid to the coordinator (confirmation letter).
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If payment is not made
to the coordinator by the date specified in the confirmation letter, the granting authority may
call on the Mutual Insurance Mechanism to intervene, if continuation of the action is
guaranteed and the conditions set out in the rules governing the Mechanism are met.
In this case, it will send a beneficiary recovery letter, together with a debit note with the
terms and date for payment.
The debit note for the beneficiary will include the amount calculated for the affiliated entities
which also had to end their participation (if any).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.]

EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible lump sum contributions claimed for work packages
implemented during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out
the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report and the work packages declared.
Their approval does not imply recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or
correctness of their content.
Incomplete work packages and work packages that have not been delivered or cannot be
approved will be rejected (see Article 27).
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the
reporting period, by calculating the lump sum contributions for the approved work packages.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary
termination (if any). The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
[OPTION for programmes with early prefinancing clearing (before reaching the interim
payment ceiling): If prefinancing clearing before reaching the interim payment ceiling is
provided for in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2), the total accepted EU contribution will be
lowered to clear the amount of prefinancing payments previously made.]
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of prefinancing and
interim payments (if any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
41Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the remaining eligible lump sum
contributions claimed for the implemented work packages (if any).
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report and the work packages
declared. Their approval does not imply recognition of compliance, authenticity,
completeness or correctness of their content.
Work packages (or parts of them) that have not been delivered or cannot be approved will be
rejected (see Article 27).
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all
reporting periods, by calculating the lump sum contributions for the approved work packages.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Not applicable
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Not applicable
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of prefinancing
and interim payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{final grant amount
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments made (if any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The amount retained
for the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (see above) will be released and paid to the coordinator
(in accordance with the rules governing the Mechanism).]
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
42Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
If [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): — despite the
release of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism contribution —] the balance is negative, it will
be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why
- [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): requesting a
report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiaries within 30 days of receiving
notification and]
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
[OPTION 1 for programmes without Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations
are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it
has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with
a debit note with the terms and date for payment.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations
are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it
has received) and the coordinator has submitted the report on the distribution of payments, it
will calculate the share of the debt per beneficiary, by:
(a) identifying the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:
{{{total
accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the
action},
minus
}
{prefinancing and interim payments received by the beneficiary (if any)}
and
(b) dividing the debt:
{{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned
43Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
divided by
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to
point (a)}
multiplied by
the amount to be recovered}.
and confirm the amount to be recovered from each beneficiary concerned (confirmation
letter), together with debit notes with the terms and date for payment.
The debit notes for beneficiaries will include the amounts calculated for their affiliated
entities (if any).
If the coordinator has not submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the granting
authority will recover the full amount from the coordinator (confirmation letter and debit
note with the terms and date for payment).]
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see
Article 25) — the granting authority rejects lump sum contributions (see Article 27) or
reduces the grant (see Article 28), it will calculate the revised final grant amount for the
beneficiary concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the
beneficiary, by calculating the ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total
accepted EU contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its
share in the final grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is
calculated as follows:
{{{total
accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
44Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
multiplied by
final grant amount for the
action}.
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons
why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be
recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent —
against any amounts owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may
be offset before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU
executive agency, debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other
Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) [OPTION 1 for programmes with prefinancing guarantees: by drawing on the
financial guarantee(s) (if any)][OPTION 2 for programmes without prefinancing
guarantees: financial guarantee(s): not applicable]
(c) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: by
holding other beneficiaries jointly and severally liable (if any; see Data Sheet, Point
4.4)] [OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries:
joint and several liability of beneficiaries: not applicable]
(d) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of affiliated entities: by
holding affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point
4.4)][OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of affiliated
entities: joint and several liability of affiliated entities: not applicable] or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that the granting authority is the
European Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable
decision under Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and
Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
45Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism was called on by the granting authority to intervene, recovery will be
continued in the name of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism. If two debit notes were sent, the
second one (in the name of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism) will be considered to replace
the first one (in the name of the granting authority). Where the MIM intervened, offsetting,
enforceable decisions or any other of the above-mentioned forms of enforced recovery may be
used mutatis mutandis.]
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in
Article 22.5, from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including
the date the full payment is received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and
then against the principal.
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless
Directive 2015/236622 applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by
offsetting or enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission
(see also Article 43).
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the
beneficiaries are entitled to late-payment interest at the reference rate applied by the
European Central Bank (ECB) for its main refinancing operations in euros, plus the
percentage specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The ECB reference rate to be used is the
rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as published
in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the
coordinator only on request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional
and local government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State
for the purpose of this Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not
be considered as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for
payment (see above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.

Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 23 — GUARANTEES
[OPTION 1 for programmes without prefinancing guarantees: Not applicable]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with prefinancing guarantees:
23.1 Prefinancing guarantee
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2), the beneficiaries must
provide (one or more) prefinancing guarantee(s) in accordance with the timing and the
amounts set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them to the granting authority in due time before the
prefinancing they are linked to.
The guarantees must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the
following conditions:
(a) be provided by a bank or approved financial institution established in the EU or — if
requested by the coordinator and accepted by the granting authority — by a third party
or a bank or financial institution established outside the EU offering equivalent
security
(b) the guarantor stands as first-call guarantor and does not require the granting authority
to first have recourse against the principal debtor (i.e. the beneficiary concerned) and
(c) remain explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the
form of a recovery, until five months after the debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
They will be released within the following month.
23.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If the beneficiaries breach their obligation to provide the prefinancing guarantee, the
prefinancing will not be paid.
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5. ]

compliance with the obligations under the Agreement (general project reviews or specific
issues reviews).
Such project reviews may be started during the implementation of the action and until the
time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned and will be considered to start on the date of the
notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent, outside experts. If it uses
outside experts, the coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right
to object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the
deadline requested — any information and data in addition to deliverables and reports already
submitted. The granting authority may request beneficiaries to provide such information to it
directly. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings,
including with the outside experts.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises

other personal data) to verify compliance with the Agreement. Sensitive information and
documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises
(including for the external audit firm) and must ensure that information requested is readily
available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested,
including electronic format.
On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which
has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and
will be formally notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed with the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights
of checks, reviews and audits as the granting authority.
25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the
periodic assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.

To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the
action, at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until
any ongoing checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have
been concluded.
25.5 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations — Extension of
findings
25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures
described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount
(see Article 22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may
lead to a request for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set
out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities,
fraud or breach of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU
grants awarded under similar conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Findings of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this
grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions, to have committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or
breach of obligations that have a material impact on this grant and
24 Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and
inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests
against fraud and other irregularities (OJ L 292, 15/11/1996, p. 2).
50Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the
list of grants affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to
extend the findings and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of lump sum contributions: the notification will
include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors, to calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or
practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations,
revised financial statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction
method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the
implementation (i.e. start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the
revised financial statements or the announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see
Articles 27 and 28).
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, lump sum contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the
objectives and indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
51Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit
set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or
beneficiaries and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact
of the action, including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may
apply the measures described in Chapter 5.
CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at interim payment, final payment or afterwards — reject any
lump sum contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in particular following checks,
reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant
(see Article 25).
Ineligible lump sum contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The
coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification —
submit observations if it disagrees with the rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects lump sum contributions, it will deduct them from the
contributions declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery;
see Article 22).
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards —
reduce the grant for a beneficiary, if:
52Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and
proportionate to the seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach
of obligations, by applying an individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the
reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving
notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the reduction (payment review
procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the
amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment
cannot be processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or
additional information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing extension procedure,
queries about eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
53Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons
why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will
be lifted — and the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to
confirm if the suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the
revised report is not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority
may also terminate the grant or the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for
one or more beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make
partial payment(s) for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the
payment (or recovery) of the remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to
be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
54Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the
coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting
authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the
suspension end date.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For
interim payments, the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article
21) must not contain any financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated
entities). The coordinator must include them in the next periodic report after the suspension is
lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of the action — in the last periodic report.
ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional
circumstances — in particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation
impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission
of the amendment request and
- the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately
request another amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption
date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes
necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been
terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the suspension end
date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no work may be done.
Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new work packages may be started.
55Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(c) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with linked actions: [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues:
not applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the grant: the linked action (see
Article 3) has not started as specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can
no longer contribute, and this impacts the implementation of the action under
this Agreement]]
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: additional GA suspension grounds: not applicable]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with additional GA suspension grounds:
[additional GA suspension grounds: insert other grounds]].
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification).
56Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority
will formally notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the
suspension end date and invite the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to
set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the
grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the
suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be before the date
on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no work may be done.
Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new work packages may be started.
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see
Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a
beneficiary (see Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a
periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of
the report submitted and taking into account the lump sum contributions for activities
implemented before the end of work date (see Article 22). Partial lump sum contributions for
work packages that were not completed (e.g. due to technical reasons) may exceptionally be
taken into account.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only lump sum
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
57Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries,
on request of the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment
request must be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting
period until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary;
change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the
reports submitted in previous interim payments (i.e. beneficiary’s lump sum contributions for
completed and approved work packages).
58Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Lump sum contributions for ongoing/not yet completed work packages will have to be
included in the periodic report for the next reporting periods when those work packages have
been completed.
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into
question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant
termination (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21
(reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27
(rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.3 EU-initiated GA or beneficiary termination
32.3.1 Conditions
The granting authority may terminate the grant or the participation of one or more
beneficiaries, if:
(a) one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 40)
(b) a change to the action or the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership
situation of a beneficiary is likely to substantially affect the implementation of the
action or calls into question the decision to award the grant (including changes linked
to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour)
(c) following termination of one or more beneficiaries, the necessary changes to the
Agreement (and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
(d) implementation of the action has become impossible or the changes necessary for its
continuation would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants
(e) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is subject to bankruptcy
proceedings or similar (including insolvency, winding-up, administration by a
liquidator or court, arrangement with creditors, suspension of business activities, etc.)
(f) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is in breach of social
security or tax obligations

or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been found guilty of
grave professional misconduct
(h) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,

corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money laundering, terrorism-
related crimes (including terrorism financing), child labour or human trafficking
(i) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) was created under a
different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social or other legal

(j) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.)
(k) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in
other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(l) despite a specific request by the granting authority, a beneficiary does not request —
through the coordinator — an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of
one of its affiliated entities or associated partners that is in one of the situations under
points (d), (f), (e), (g), (h), (i) or (j) and to reallocate its tasks, or
(m) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with linked actions: [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues:
not applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the grant: the linked action (see
Article 3) has not started as specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can
no longer contribute, and this impacts the implementation of the action under
this Agreement]]
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: additional GA termination grounds: not applicable]

32.3.2 Procedure
60Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting
authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will
take effect (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is
discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also
inform the coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit
a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the
basis of the report submitted and taking into account the lump sum contributions for
activities implemented before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Partial lump
sum contributions for work packages that were not completed (e.g. due to technical
reasons) may exceptionally be taken into account.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator
may not submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only lump
sum contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see
Article 28) or to impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority
(see Article 33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —
submit:
61Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open
reporting period until termination, containing an overview of the progress
of the work
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated
beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of
the reports submitted in previous interim payments (i.e. beneficiary’s lump sum
contributions for completed and approved work packages).
Lump sum contributions for ongoing/not yet completed work packages will have to be
included in the periodic report for the next reporting periods when those work
packages have been completed.
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments
within the deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned
and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal
treatment of applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND ADMINISTRATIVE
SANCTIONS
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to
third parties as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross
negligence.
62Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the
beneficiaries or other participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the
implementation of the Agreement.
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a
result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full
compliance with the Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.
The liability does not extend to indirect or consequential losses or similar damage (such as
loss of profit, loss of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by
wilful act or by a breach of confidentiality.
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as preventing the adoption of administrative
sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public
law measures, in addition or as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this
Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to 148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and
Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 2988/9525).
SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot
be considered in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants
involved in the action) and
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without
delay, stating the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force
majeure and do their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.

CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal, in accordance with the
Portal Terms and Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if
explicitly instructed otherwise by the granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the grant agreement (project
number and acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and
Conditions. For naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated —
before the signature of this Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’.
The role and tasks of the LEAR are stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms
and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the
Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of
sending, as indicated by the time logs.
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the
communication is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not
been accessed within 10 days after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general
principles apply (i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with
proof of delivery will be considered to have been received either on the delivery date
registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be
considered in breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Addresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is
the official mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.

ARTICLE 37 — INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT
The provisions in the Data Sheet take precedence over the rest of the Terms and Conditions of
the Agreement.
Annex 5 takes precedence over the Terms and Conditions; the Terms and Conditions take
precedence over the Annexes other than Annex 5.
Annex 2 takes precedence over Annex 1.
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7126, periods expressed in days, months or years are
calculated from the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement
which would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in
the Portal Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries
(see Annex 3). If a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission
must be done by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or
proof that this opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.

If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45
days of receiving notification (or any additional information the granting authority has
requested). If it does not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same
deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no
notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the
amendment.
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession
form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry
into force of the Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
its entry into force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must
— within 30 days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and
make any changes necessary to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not
affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with
Article 39. It must include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary
directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the
grant to a new beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal
Amendment tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
66Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE
GRANTING AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting
authority to any third party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority
on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed,
the assignment will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations
towards the granting authority.
ARTICLE 43 — APPLICABLE LAW AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
43.1 Applicable law
The Agreement is governed by the applicable EU law, supplemented if necessary by the law
of Belgium.
Special rules may apply for beneficiaries which are international organisations (if any; see
Data Sheet, Point 5).
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties
must bring action before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice —
under Article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium — unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU
court judgements.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet,
Point 5), the dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in
accordance with the Rules for Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under
Article 299 TFEU (see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the
General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions
against offsetting and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European
Commission (not against the granting authority; see also Article 22).
ARTICLE 44 — ENTRY INTO FORCE
The Agreement will enter into force on the day of signature by the granting authority or the
coordinator, depending on which is later.

1. Introduction
In order to receive EU funding/tenders (i.e. grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc), applicants need to fulfill a certain number of conditions
which must be checked before any funding can be awarded to them.
Some of these checks are done centrally by the EU Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register, set up in accordance with
Articles 128 and 147 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/10461 as central repository
and electronic data interchange area for participants.
This guidance sets out the rules that the Central Validation Service will use for these
checks. They currently cover:
− legal entity validation (also called ‘PIC validation’)
− LEAR appointment
− collecting the financial information for the financial capacity assessment (also
called ‘FCA’)
− ownership control assessment (also called ‘OCA’).
For these checks, the participants will be contacted directly by the Central Validation
Service and asked to submit the necessary information and supporting documents via
the Participant Register. This happens normally during preparation of the first grant,
procurement, prize or contribution agreement that successfully passed the evaluation
stage, but can also occur later during subsequent applications or in case of changes.
All data and documents will be treated as confidential.
Personal data will be handled in accordance with Regulation 2018/17252 to ensure
compliance with the principles of transparency, proportionality, impartiality and
legality. For the details, please refer to the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy
Statement (available on Portal > Legal Notices).
2. Legal entity validation
2.1. Legal entity validation and specific legal statuses: Criteria and
conditions
One of the main tasks of the Central Validation Service is the validation of new legal
entities applying for EU grants, procurements, prizes and contribution agreements.
Legal entity validation is a requirement under the Financial Regulation. It serves to
ensure that only verified entities can enter into financial relations with the EU and to
avoid legally invalid contracts.
Legal entity validation is needed only once, to get the legal entity information and

participant identification code (PIC) validated. Once validated, the participants can
enter into financial relations with the EU and use the PIC for all EU actions managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. The PIC will be valid for all ongoing application
procedures and signature in the system, but also for any type of EU funding in the
future — without having to re-register or be re-validated.
This is why the standards for PIC validation are applied consistently, independently of
the specific call/application/tender procedure that triggers the validation. The same
criteria and checks are applied for grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc, as well as for low and high value contracts.
The validation comprises two distinct actions: (a) the verification that the participant
exists as legal entity capable of entering into financial relations with the EU, including
correctness of the participant’s legal data (legal form, address, etc) and (b) the
verification of certain specific legal statuses that are used in EU funding programmes
and recorded centrally in the Participant Register.
2.1.1 Legal entity validation
‘Legal entity’ means a natural person or an entity created and recognised by law as a
legal person. It must have legal personality and, acting on its own account and in its
own name, be able to exercise rights and be subject to obligations.
Specific cases
❖ Natural persons (including self-employed persons; see below) — Are by default
considered as being legal entities. However, the Central Validation Service will refuse
validation of persons that cannot legally enter into contractual relations with the EU
(e.g. persons under age).
❖ Branches — Are not regarded as legal entities, since they do not have legal
personality distinct from that of their mother-company. The fact that they are
registered in national official registers is not relevant. It will be their mother-company
that will be considered as legal entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in
the Participant Register. The same applies to branches established in a different
country or branches of entities such as non-profit organisations, NGOs, etc.
❖ Foreign companies (company establishments which are registered with a special
status in the official register, e.g. ‘société de droit étranger’) — Will not be regarded
as legal entities, since they do not have legal personality distinct from that of their
mother-company. It will be their mother-company that will be considered as legal
entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register (the
one registered in the country of incorporation).
❖ Entities set-up within (or under) a parent organisation (such as
departments/centers/offices, without legal personality, despite having administrative
or budgetary autonomy, own VAT number/fiscal code/number of registration, etc) —
Cannot be regarded as legal entities and are considered as belonging to their parent-
organisation. It will be their parent organisation that will be considered as legal entity
for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register.
2.1.2 Exception: Validation of private entities without legal personality
By way of exception, the Financial Regulation allows for certain ‘entities without legal
personality’ to be eligible for EU grants. Such entities can therefore be validated in
the Participant Register, provided they meet the conditions set out in Article
197(2)(c) of this Regulation:
7EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on behalf
of the entity
and
− the entity offers equivalent guarantees for the protection of the EU financial
interests as a legal person, in particular equivalent financial and operational
capacity (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
This exception aims at private entities, i.e. associations or similar entities with
permanent structures (secretariat, management board, assembly, etc.) that have
their own activities, but just lack formal legal personality.
Concerning the first condition, the entity must prove its representatives' capacity to
undertake legal obligations on its behalf. This condition is not met when the
obligations are assumed on behalf of the representatives themselves or on behalf of
the owner(s) of the entity.
Concerning the second condition, the entity must prove the following elements:
− existence of patrimony/assets/capital separated and different from those of its
members/owners
and
− rules ensuring that creditors can rely on such patrimony/assets/capital and
that, in case of liquidation/insolvency, creditors are reimbursed prior to the
repartition of the patrimony/assets/capital among the owners/members (—
both conditions must be fulfilled and proved by supporting documents).
This exception only applies for participation in EU grants; entities without legal
personality cannot participate in EU tenders.
2.1.3 Exception: Validation of ministries, specialised entities of IOs and
certain EU bodies
By way of exception, the Central Validation Service will also accept the following
public entities without legal personality to be validated in the Participant Register:
− the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) (explicitly declared eligible by Articles
176(2) and 197(4) of the Financial Regulation)
− ministries, executive services which are part of the public administration of a
(central or federated) State and directly linked to the government and other
services which are part of the legislative or judicial administration, in
accordance with the official organisation of the State
− assimilated international organisations referred to in Article 156(2) of the
Financial Regulation
− specialised entities set up by international organisations, that lack legal
personality
− Common Foreign Security Policy (CFSP) missions and EU special
representatives set up by the Council of the European Union.
Departments/directorates/units/offices and other entities set up within a Ministry (or
within an executive or other service) without legal personality are considered as part
of the same Ministry (or service) and cannot be considered as independent legal
8EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
entities (e.g. schools, libraries, etc). They will have to use the PIC of their parent
organisation to participate in EU grants, procurements, prizes, etc.
2.1.4 Specific legal statuses
In addition, the validation covers the following specific legal statuses that are used in
certain EU funding programmes:
− private entity or public body
− non-profit or for profit organisation
− small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
− middle-capitalisation enterprise (mid-cap)
− non-governmental organisation (NGO)
− civil society organisation (CSO)
− international organisation (IO)
− research organisation
− secondary or higher education establishment.
An entity may be categorised in more than one of these legal statuses (i.e. non-profit,
public body, research organisation, international organisation, etc.).
The practical relevance of these statuses (and what happens if they change) is
established at the level of the different funding programmes, and sometimes even at
the level of the call for proposals/call for tender.
Moreover, not all of these statuses are systematically checked and validated by the
Central Validation Service. Some of them are self-declarations or self-assessments.
This means that the participants are solely responsible for the correctness of the
information they provide (in the self-declaration/self-assessment).
The Central Validation Service may however — at any time — carry out checks on
self-declared/self-assessed statuses against supporting documents and ask for
clarifications.
In case of false declarations, the EU services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status(es)
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements,
etc.; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
Private entity or public body
'Private entity' means an entity established under private law.
‘Public body’ means an entity established as a public body by national law, or an
9EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
international organisation.
‘Established as a public body by national law’ means:
− incorporated as a public body in the act of creation or recognised as a public
body by national law
and
− governed by public law (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
Criteria such as:
− mission or activity in the general interest (public service mission)
− the fact that the shares are owned by a public body (even if ownership reaches
up to 100% of the share capital)
− public financing
− state supervision and control
do NOT constitute sufficient evidence to qualify an entity as a public body, if the
above two conditions are not met.
Public bodies may however act and be subject to private law for some or most of their
activities, provided that, concerning their existence and their functioning, they are
subject to public law.
The two statuses (private entity and public body) are mutually exclusive, meaning
that you can only be validated as one or the other.
They are systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the
Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Self-employed persons (persons who perform an activity independently and with
their own means, such as craftsmen and individuals exercising liberal, industrial and
commercial professions) — Are regarded as ‘natural persons’, not as ‘private entities’;
the business/profession/activity they perform is not provided with independent legal
personality different from that of the person.
❖ Private law bodies with a public service mission3 — A legal entity
incorporated under private law/private legal form is not considered to be a public
body even if owned by the State/other public bodies and/or pursuing a public service
mission.
Non-profit
‘Non-profit entity’ means an entity that is non-profit making by its legal form or legal
purpose (e.g. charitable organisations), or that has a legal or statutory obligation not
to distribute profits to its shareholders or members.
All profits have to be reinvested in the same activity of the entity.
3 Article 62(1)(c)(vi) of Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
10EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Decisions on (not) distributing profits made by the managing board, associates,
stakeholders, members, or representatives and/or practices adopted by the entity to
not distribute profits and/or the absence of profits achieved are not sufficient proof of
the non-profit nature. The obligation not to distribute profits and/or the impossibility
to distribute profits must be based on law and/or the act of establishment/articles of
association/statutes, etc.
Whether the owners/founders of the entity are non-profit and whether the profits are
allocated to non-profit (or for profit) entities is irrelevant.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Public bodies — Are in principle regarded as non-profit by default.
❖ Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) — The classification as ‘non-
governmental organisation (NGO)’ is not relevant for the non-profit status, since in
most countries NGO is not a recognized legal form. By contrast, non-profit status is a
prerequisite for the self-declaration as NGO (see below).
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
‘Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)’ means a micro, small or medium-sized
enterprise as defined in the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361, i.e.:
− engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form (including, in
particular, self-employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or
other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an
economic activity)
and
− employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as
defined in Article 5 of the SME Recommendation) and which have an annual
turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and/or an annual balance sheet total
not exceeding EUR 43 million.4
An entity is considered to be engaged in an ‘economic activity’, if it proves to be
involved in any form of trade or activity done for remuneration or pecuniary interest
on the market. Thus, in general, any activity consisting in (directly or indirectly)
offering goods or services on a given market is an economic activity.
The following will NOT be considered economic activities:
− activities which do not entail (directly or indirectly) some sort of pecuniary
offset or
− activities for which there is no given/direct (or indirect) market or
− activities for which the income generated is not distinct from the personal
income of the entity’s members or shareholders.
4 The SME ceilings must be calculated by including the headcount of staff, the balance sheet total and the
turnover data of all relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361.
11EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024

This status is self-declared. For calls where the SME status has an impact on eligibility
or funding (higher funding rate, etc), participants must go through a self-assessment
wizard.
Two-year rule — In accordance with Article 4.2 of the SME Recommendation, the SME
status depends on the ceilings for two consecutive accounting periods. Headcount and
turnover must stay below the ceilings for two accounting periods to obtain the SME
status; conversely, the status will be lost if they rise above the ceilings for two
consecutive periods.
Since the SME self-assessment looks at the information for only one accounting
period (the last one), the SME self-assessment result may be flawed. Participants that
were below the ceiling the year before, must contact the Central Validation Service
via the Participant Register in order to request a formal validation. This validation will
then take into account the two accounting periods.
The two-year rule does not apply for changes due to a merger or acquisition.
Enterprises that are subject to a change in ownership need to be assessed on the
basis of their shareholder structure at the time of the transaction. If the aggregated
headcount and financial data of the new structure exceed the SME ceilings, the SME
status is lost immediately from the date of the transaction5.
Participants whose SME status changes after registration must update their data in
the Participant Register. This is important not only for eligibility checks in grant
applications, but also for statistical purposes.
Specific cases
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that do not yet have
closed accounts or companies without economic activity but expecting to enter
soon into the market — May also qualify as SMEs, as long as they are able to provide
a ‘bona fide estimate’ (in the form of a business plan) covering the period necessary
for the entity to generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long time-to market
— Are allowed to demonstrate that they are engaged in an economic activity by
showing the investments made and the likely expected return.
Middle-capitalisation enterprise (Mid-cap)
'Middle-capitalisation enterprise’ means an enterprise that is:
− not a micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under the EU SME
Recommendation 2003/361
and
− employing up to 3 000 persons6 , where the headcount of staff, including all
relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises, is calculated in
accordance with Article 3 to 6 of the Annex to the Recommendation.
This status is self-declared. For calls where the mid-cap status has an impact on
eligibility or funding (higher funding rate, etc.), participants must go through the SME
5 See Recital 9 of Recommendation No, 2003/361/EC and the User Guide to the SME Definition (p. 14).
6 Expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Annex of EU recommendation
2003/361.
12EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
self-assessment wizard to make sure that they do not fall under the definition of SME,
and then to self-declare that the number of employees does not exceed 3 000
persons.
Non-governmental organisation (NGO)
‘Non-governmental organisations’ are organisations which are voluntary, independent
from government and non-profit, and which are not a political party or trade union.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by private entities,
which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Civil society organisation (CSO)
‘Civil society organisations’ are organisations from the ‘third sector’ of society, distinct
from government and business (i.e. private for profit entities).
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will normally be accepted only by private
entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
International organisation (IO)
‘International organisation’ means an intergovernmental organisation (other than the
EU) established under international public law, including specialised entities — with or
without legal personality — set up by international organisations.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
For some EU funding programmes there are moreover specific subtypes of
international organisations:
− ‘international organisations of European interest for H2020 (H2020 IOEI)’, i.e.
international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member
States or H2020 associated countries and whose main objective is promoting
scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international European research organisations for Horizon Europe (HE IERO)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries and whose main
objective is promoting scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international organisations of European interest for Digital Europe (DEP IOEI)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or whose headquarters are in an EU Member State.
The H2020 IOEI subtype status is systematically checked against supporting
documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.
The HE IERO and DEP IOEI subtype statuses are self-declared. In the future, for calls
where the HE IERO and DEP IOEI statuses have an impact on eligibility or funding,
participants will also be asked to go through a self-assessment wizard.
Specific cases
❖ Entities set up as distinct bodies by an international organisation with a
special mission but which do not have explicit legal personality — Can be validated
as with legal personality, if they meet any of the following criteria:
− they have treaty-making capacity or
13EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− they have capacity to act at international level independently from the
organisation that set them up (i.e. capacity to undertake legal obligations).
If such entities do not meet one of the above criteria, they can exceptionally be
validated as without legal personality (see section 2.1.3 above).
Research organisation
‘Research organisation’ means an entity that:
− is established as non-profit organisation as described above
and
− carries out research and/or technological development as its main objective.
The following are NOT considered research activities:
− supporting or financing research activities carried out by other entities
− promoting, managing or coordinating research activities.
Only entities that have research and/or development as their main objective can
qualify as research organisations. By contrast, entities that have research and/or
development as ancillary activities (even if regular and substantial, e.g. in museums
or hospitals) do not qualify as ‘research organisations’.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by entities, which
have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Secondary or higher education establishment
‘Secondary or higher education establishment’ means an entity that is recognised as
such by its national education system and is able to deliver diplomas recognised by
the State.
It can be a public body or a private entity (see above). The national accreditation as a
secondary/higher education establishment is not sufficient to consider the entity as a
public body.
This status is self-declared.
2.2 Documents and information to provide
2.2.1 General requirements and principles
The legal validation of entities is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participants as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
by the participants on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (can be
required by the EU services at any time).
In principle only official documents are accepted. Documents are considered as official
when they are delivered by official national authorities. Official documents can NOT be
replaced by self-declarations or by sworn or solemn statements before judicial or
administrative authorities, notaries or public officers.
As a general rule, documents are accepted in any of the EU official languages.
Participants may however be requested to submit an English free (unofficial)
translation to facilitate the validation process. Documents in non-EU languages will be
accepted only if accompanied by a free translation in English (and in case of doubt, a
14EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
certified/legal translation in English may be requested). Free translations should
always be accompanied by the copies of the original official documents.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as for any information provided by other means
(e.g. by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
2.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Signed legal entity identification form7:
− Natural Person Form: in English
− Private Legal Entity Form: in English
− Public Legal Entity Form: in English.
2. Official VAT document or — if the entity is not registered for VAT — the proof of
VAT exemption, not older than one (1) year.
For the specific legal statuses, participants will be asked to submit the following
additional documents:
Status Documents to be submitted
Private entity A valid registration extract not older than one (1) year.
Documents older than one year may be accepted if valid for a
(including SME and mid-cap)
certain period of time expressly indicated in the same
document (e.g. valid for two years) and if submitted via the
Participant Register within this period of time.
Public body Copy of the act, law, decree or decision that established the
entity as a public body (or, if this does not exist, any other
official legal document that proves this).
Natural person Integral copy (legible) of valid identity card or passport (e.g. in
case of identity card, both sides must be provided).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Entities without legal personality Copy of an official document attesting that the representatives
of the entity have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on
its behalf.
Copy of an official document attesting that the entity has the
same operational and financial viability as that of a legal entity:
i.e.
1. a document showing patrimony/assets/capital that
are separated and different from those of the
members/owners of the entity, and
2. a copy of the rules providing that creditors can rely
on this patrimony/assets/capital and — in case of
liquidation/insolvency — are reimbursed before the
patrimony/assets/capital are divided between the
owners/members.
Non-profit Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is non-
profit by its legal form or by its legal purpose, or that it has a
legal or statutory obligation not to distribute profits to
shareholders or individual members.
The certificate of tax exemption is only an indication of the
non-profit status and will therefore be assessed together with
other elements.
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME) The following documents must be provided for the participant
and mid-caps and for its linked and partner entities (in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation
(— if expressly requested by the Central
2003/361):
Validation Service)
1. graph showing the complete ownership structure,
including all direct and indirect shareholders
2. proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners
and their respective percentage of interest and voting
rights
3. approved financial statements for the most recent
closed accounting period, including:
− balance sheet statement
− profit and loss account, clearly indicating the
amount of annual turnover from sales of goods
and services
− annexes to these documents and/or
accompanying notes, indicating (i) staff head
count and (ii) any equity participations in other
companies/downstream organisations with
exact percentage of the shares and voting rights
held. If the annexes/notes to the financial
statements do not contain the requested
information, other documents can be provided
that contain equivalent data (such as headcount
reports for social security purposes, extracts from
HR records certifying headcount, etc); in
exceptional cases, self-declarations can be
accepted
4. documents explaining the mechanisms of ownership
and control, corporate governance and decision-
making rules (e.g. statutes/articles of association and
shareholders’ agreements; memorandum of
16EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
understanding among shareholders, internal corporate
governance rules, etc)
Sworn or solemn statements before a judicial or
administrative authority, notary or public officer cannot replace
the above listed documents as proof of the SME or mid-cap
status.
The following documents must be submitted in the below
specific cases:
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that
do not yet have closed accounts — Instead of approved
financial statements, a self-declaration must be provided,
including a bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan)
for the entire period (financial years) necessary for the entity to
generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long
time-to market — In addition to the approved financial
statements, a self-declaration must be provided, including a
bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan) for the
entire period (financial years) necessary to generate turnover,
including a declaration of the investment made and the likely
expected return (to demonstrate that, despite the lack of
turnover, the enterprise is engaged in an economic activity).
❖ Entities owned directly or indirectly by natural persons —
Self-declaration on the natural person(s) engagement in
economic activity and possible participations in other entities
must be provided. The template for the self-declaration will be
provided to participants during the validation process if specific
cases of ownership by natural persons are identified.
International organisation Copy of the international treaty creating the organisation under
international public law.
Research organisation Copy of an official document attesting research or technological
development as the main objective of the entity.
(— if expressly requested by the Central
Validation Service)
Secondary or higher education Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is
establishment recognised as ‘secondary or higher education establishment’ by
the national education system and is entitled to deliver
(— if expressly requested by the Central
diplomas recognized by the State.
Validation Service)
For other categories such as NGO, Civil Society Organisation, etc no supporting
documents are needed (unless exceptionally requested by the Central Validation
Service).
2.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
17EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− the documents submitted are outdated (e.g. VAT document or extract of
registration no longer valid or more than one (1) year old)
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the validation (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
2.3 Validation and effective date
On the basis of the submitted information and documents, the participant will be
validated with the effective date of entry into force of the legal act establishing its
constitution or incorporation (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
That date will be, in order of precedence:
1. the date of registration in the country's’official registry (e.g. commercial
registry)
2. the date of publication in the national official journal
3. the date of the legal deposit of the act in the court registry
4. the date of signature of the parties.
When there is no act of constitution or incorporation, the participant will be
considered to exist since a standard default date.
The effective date for the SME and mid-cap status will be the accounts closure date of
the accounting period on which the assessment is based in accordance with Article
4(2) of the Annex of the SME Recommendation 2003/361. For newly established
enterprises that do not yet have closed accounts, the effective date is the date of
their creation.
The effective date of other specific legal statuses is the date in which the specific
status enters into force. This date may be the same as its effective date of
constitution or incorporation (or may differ, if the specific status has been acquired
later on).
2.4 Modification of validations
Modifications in the validation can be made in the following cases:
− following a request submitted by the participant to update the validation (e.g.
in case of changes in the participant’s legal situation such as change of
identity/legal form, name, address, status) or
− after checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out by the EU services
which necessitate a correction.
2.4.1 Validation updates
In case of a change in the participant’s legal situation (identity/legal form, name,
address, status, etc), the participant must request an update of the validation.
18EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Requests to update a validation will be accepted, if submitted by the participant’s
LEAR and accompanied by the relevant supporting documents. If no LEAR has
been appointed yet in the Participant Register, requests for modification should be
submitted after the LEAR appointment has been validated.
The ‘effective date of the change’ will be the date on which the act establishing the
change enters into force (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
For SMEs and mid-caps, the effective date is the closure date of the accounting period
on which the change of status is based. For cases of mergers and acquisitions that
lead to the loss of the SME or mid-cap status, the effective date of change will be the
date when the ownership structure changed.
The impact and practical consequences of the changes depend on each funding
programme.
2.4.2 Corrections of validations
If a validation turns out to beincorrect (through an audit, ex-post check, investigation
or other means), it will be corrected by the Central Validation Service. The correction
will be registered with effect back to the effective date of the initial validation.
If the error is attributable to the Central Validation Service and its correction implies
disadvantages for the participant, the retroactive effect may exceptionally be waived,
if duly justified and in line with the principles of sound financial management and
proportionality.
If the error was the fault of the participant (intentional or unintentional), its
participation in on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc
may be terminated and undue amounts paid may be recovered. Moreover, the
participant may be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements,
prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial
Regulation). In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
2.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If they find out that a participant did not meet the criteria for being validated or for
being validated with a specific legal status (e.g. due to false declarations), the
modification of the validation will be registered with retroactive effect back to the
effective date of the validation.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc, their participation may be terminated/withdrawn and
undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.

3. Validation of the LEAR appointment
3.1 Validation of the LEAR appointment: General requirements and principles
In parallel with the legal entity validation, the Central Validation Service will contact
the participants to appoint their Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR), i.e.
the single point of contact needed for the Participant Register and Funding & Tenders
Portal electronic exchange system.
The appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register is mandatory for all
validated participants. Without LEAR it will NOT be possible to update the legal entity
data in the Participant Register, nor sign contracts electronically in the Funding &
Tenders Portal.
3.1.1 Role of the LEAR
The LEAR is the person officially appointed by the participant to handle their access
rights and key data in the Participant Register (legal and other data, certain access
rights in the electronic exchange system, etc.).
Once validated, it is the LEAR who is responsible for giving access rights to the Portal
electronic exchange system and who must ensure that the participant’s legal
information is always up to date.
The LEAR must enter and update on the ‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen the names
of the:
− legal representatives and signatories for the organisation (so-called ‘LSIGNs’);
these are people who are able to commit the organisation legally by signing
contracts and authorising amendments to them and
− persons that may sign cost statements on behalf of the organisation (so-called
‘FSIGNs’).
If needed, the LEARs can delegate their tasks to one or more colleagues, who will act
as account administrators (so-called ‘AccAds’; delegation also through the
‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen).
In case of changes, the LEAR must encode the change in the Participant Register and,
if needed, request validation and provide supporting documents.
For a detailed description of the LEAR rights and responsibilities, see the LEAR
appointment letter*.
3.1.2 Position of the LEAR
The LEAR is an administrative function that may be held by the participant’s legal
representative or another key person within the entity.
The LEAR must be someone employed in the entity (most commonly in the central
administrative services of the entity) and should be able to ensure the stability and
continuity that is needed to fulfil this role in order to honour the participant’s
contractual obligations.
Participants that are natural persons will automatically have the role of LEAR; in this
case the role cannot be attributed to a different person (but the LEAR can appoint an
account administrator).
20EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Each participant can only appoint one LEAR and must ensure to immediately replace
their LEAR in case they are no longer able to exercise the role (e.g. job change,
dismissal, death, etc; see section 3.3).
The participant assumes the full responsibility for the choice of the person they
appoint as LEAR.
3.1.3 Legal representative
The LEAR must be appointed by the participant’s legal representative. The legal
representative is a person duly authorised to act on behalf of the entity and to
commit it in its entirety vis-à-vis third parties.
Specific cases
❖ Persons tasked with the daily management — Can not be recognized as legal
representatives if they are not entitled to engage and represent the entity outside
ordinary day-to-day business matters.
The ‘daily management’ (‘gestion journalière’) is commonly understood as comprising
those acts that, because of their minor importance or the need for a prompt solution,
do not justify the intervention of the management bodies. It consists of ordinary
business and execution of day-to-day decisions and in line with the general
instructions of the management board.
❖ Limitations — Similarly, persons empowered to engage and commit the
participant only within certain limits (including financial limits) can not be accepted as
legal representatives for the purposes of the LEAR appointment.
3.1.4 Timing of the LEAR appointment
The process for appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register can run in parallel
to the validation of the entity, but can only be finalised once the participant (PIC) is
validated.
LEAR appointment is not a condition for the submission of a proposal/tender in the
Funding & Tenders Portal, but its validation must be completed before the the grant,
procurement or contribution agreement can be signed.
3.2 List of documents and information
For the validation of the LEAR appointment, the scanned version of the following
documents must be uploaded by the participant in the Participant Register:
1. LEAR appointment letter* (specifying the LEAR roles & duties and including the
declaration of consent to the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and
Conditions*), completed, dated and signed by the legal representative and the
LEAR
2. Integral copy of an official, valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport, with
photo and signature) of:
− the legal representative and
− the appointed representative (LEAR)
3. Document(s) proving that the legal representative(s) appointing the LEAR is
empowered as such, which must:
21EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− clearly indicate the role/function within the organisation as legal
representative
− identify and appoint this person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
The originals must be kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which
can be required by the EU services at any time). They must not be sent to the Central
Validation Service.
After receiving the above-listed documents (and after the PIC has been validated),
the LEAR appointment will be validated in the Participant Register.
For a detailed description of the LEAR appointment process, see the Online Manual*
and the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions*.
Proof of identity
‘Identity documents’ are those issued by national authorities and recognized by
national law as valid proof of identity. Identity documents can not be replaced by any
other means of proof. The EU services cannot waive this requirement under any
circumstances.
Examples of identity documents accepted are ID cards and passports. Driving licenses
are also accepted, as long as they are considered as valid proof of identity under the
applicable national law of the entity concerned.
Identity documents must be valid (not expired) at the time of the LEAR appointment.
An integral copy of the document must be provided (e.g. in most countries both sides
of the identity card must be provided).
Identity documents in which some parts/elements, including the photo, have been
deleted/erased/covered (e.g. with black marker) cannot be accepted.
Specific cases
❖ Service cards and badges issued by the participant — Cannot replace identity
documents (even if the participant is a public body) and therefore cannot be accepted
as proof of identity.
❖ Print-outs from the ID electronic chip — Cannot be accepted either.
Signatures
The LEAR documents must be signed by persons who are legal representatives of the
participant.
The names of both legal representative and LEAR in the LEAR documents must
correspond to those indicated in their official identity documents. LEAR documents
signed with acronyms/nick names/etc that do not correspond to the names indicated
in the identity documents will not be accepted.
Signatures can be either handwritten signatures or qualified electronic signatures
22EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
within the meaning of Article 3(12) of Regulation 910/20148. For the latter, the
Central Validation Service will verify that the signature is based on a valid qualified
certificate and was created by a secure creation device. See here for the list of
accepted trust service providers: eIDAS Dashboard (europa.eu).
Specific cases
❖ Internal requirements (e.g. joint signature of more than one person required to
legally engage the entity, foreseen by law, act of establishment, statutes, internal
rules, etc) — In case of internal requirements, the participant is fully responsible for
ensuring compliance (e.g. through an internal process ensuring that the single
signature on the LEAR documents is made only after all the internal requirements on
joint signature are fulfilled).
❖ Limitations — The Central Validation Service will take into account limitations to
represent the entity only if these limitations are explicitly mentioned in the
documents submitted to prove the empowerment of the legal representative (e.g.
limitation in the excerpts of the company registry).
Documents proving the empowerment of the legal representative
The document(s) proving the empowerment must identify:
− the role/function of legal representative within the entity
− the name and appointment of the person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
This can be found in a single document (in case the official appointment also specifies
the powers/tasks related to the appointment) or in several documents combined (e.g.
the official act of appointment and the organisational document, such as act of
establishment, statutes, articles of association, etc, in which the powers/tasks related
to the role are identified).
The documents must be valid (not expired) at the time when the LEAR is appointed.
The documents proving the appointment of the legal representative are those
required/accepted under the applicable national law of the entity concerned. They
may vary depending on the country, the legal form and status:
− law/decree/official act/official gazette in case of public entities
− copy of the treaty in case of international organisations
− decision of assembly, official documents from the council of administration,
executive committee or directors board, excerpts of the company registry in
case of private entities.
A declaration of honour can be accepted only in exceptional, duly justified cases
where none of the above exists.
Concerning the language of such documents and participant's responsibilities
concerning translations, see section 2.2.1.
8 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on
electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 257,
28.8.2014, p. 73).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Specific cases
❖ Participants who are natural persons — Do not need to prove their
empowerment, but still need to send the supporting documents listed above. The
documents should be signed by the natural person alone. A copy of the ID documents
of the natural person must also be included.
❖ Deputising persons — In case of temporary absence of the legal
representative(s) or their impossibility to sign, other persons empowered to act as
legal representatives (i.e. deputising persons) are accepted as legal representatives
by default. The reason for the temporary absence/impossibility and the legitimation of
the deputy will not be checked by the Central Validation Service and therefore
remains under the full responsibility of the participant (see also above under ‘internal
requirements’).
❖ Ministries — For ministries, Ministers are considered legal representatives by
default and there is no need to provide the legal documents proving their
empowerment.
In addition to the Minister's role, the following roles/functions are considered as legal
representatives by default, without any further verification of the legal documents
proving their empowerment:
− Deputy Minister
− State/General Secretary and their deputies
− Directors of certain specific horizontal sectors/departments/directions, namely
'legal', 'financial','European or international relationships'.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the ministry, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website of the ministry).
Except if otherwise provided in the applicable rules (law/decree/act governing the
organisation of the ministry), other roles such as ‘Director’/‘Had of Department’/‘Head
of Unit’, etc will be considered as having limited tasks and powers (relating only to
the directorate/department/unit’s policies) and, therefore, not entitled to represent
and engage the ministry as a whole.
For Ministers, the ID document can be exceptionally replaced by a badge or service
card (issued by the ministry). This exception applies only to the person of the
‘Minister’ and cannot be extended to other representatives (such as State Secretaries,
Deputy Ministers or Directors/Head of Departments); these persons are not exempted
from the obligation to provide an ID document.
❖ Public bodies and governmental entities — For public bodies and other
state/governmental entities, including executive services at central/regional/local
level, the highest-ranked person (e.g. Director-General, President, Mayor, etc) will be
recognized as legal representative by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the entity, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website).
❖ International organisations — For international organisations, the highest-
ranked person (e.g. Secretary, Secretary-General) will be recognised as legal
representative by default.
24EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the international organisation, the
evidence may also be taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the
organisational chart published on the official website of the international
organisation).
❖ Universities and higher education establishments — For universities and
other higher education establishments (e.g. colleges, institutes, etc), the following
roles/functions are recognised as legal representative by default, without any further
verification of their powers:
− Rector and Vice-Rector
− President and Vice-President
− Chancellor and Vice Chancellor.
In case of faculties with their own legal personality (and thus independently
validated), the Dean and Vice-Dean can also act as legal representatives by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the university/higher education
establishment/faculty, the evidence may also be taken from other appropriate
sources (e.g. the organisational chart published on the official internet-site of the
university/faculty).
3.3 LEAR replacement
A LEAR replacement is equivalent to a new LEAR appointment. For the replacement of
an already validated LEAR, participants must submit the same type of documents and
the Central Validation Service will follow the procedure for the validation of LEAR
appointment (see above).
3.4 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant did not respect the obligation to keep the original
documents or committed other irregularities, appropriate measures will be taken.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, or
contribution agreements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts
paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
4. Financial capacity assessment
4.1 Financial capacity assessment: Criteria and conditions
In addition to the legal entity validation and LEAR appointment, the Central Validation
Service also assists the EU services with the financial capacity assessment (required
by the Financial Regulation for grants and procurements; not needed for prizes or
contribution agreements).
25EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The financial capacity assessment must in principle be done for each new
application/tender (— unless the participant already has a valid financial capacity
assessment performed by the Central Validation Service that is not older than 18
months).
Additional conditions depend on the type of procedure (grant or procurement),
participant and grant amount (e.g. no financial capacity assessment is needed for
public bodies in grant procedures, for Member State organisations, international
organisations, persons in receipt of education support, persons most in need and in
receipt of direct support; for low-value grants and low-value procurements).
Additional exemptions are provided in some programmes for specific situations or
types of participants.
Moreover, the financial capacity may be assessed ad hoc if there are justified grounds
to doubt it, like for example:
− indication of weak/insufficient financial capacity from other sources
− involvement in cases of serious administrative errors or fraud
− pending legal procedures or judicial proceedings for serious administrative
errors or fraud
− attachment order or recovery order for an outstanding amount issued by an
EU body on which the payment is significantly overdue
− substantial findings in EU audits within the last 2 years that put in doubt the
financial capacity.
The financial capacity is assessed on the basis of financial indicators that are in
principle the same for all EU programmes.
The financial capacity assessment is normally done during grant preparation/tender
evaluation but may also be done during implementation. If a participants’ financial
capacity must be assessed, they will be contacted by the Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The role of the Central Validation Service is to prepare the financial capacity
assessment (e.g. to collect and to analyse the financial documents). The final decision
on the financial capacity will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender separately
by the EU service in charge.
4.2 Documents and information to provide
4.2.1 General requirements and principles
The financial assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the EU
services at any time).
As a general rule, financial documents must be provided in their original language(s),
as imposed by the legislation in the participant’s country of registration. For
documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit an English free
(unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in non-EU
languages, a free translation in English is always mandatory and needs to be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
26EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
Some examples of such documents are: dated and signed annual management
reports in English for a company listed on the stock exchange or having international
shareholders or for the purpose of consolidation within a foreign group; dated and
signed extracts from national registers that use English, etc.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as any information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw or correct the financial assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
4.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Profit and loss account — approved by the management of the entity, clearly
indicating the amounts of turnover from sales of goods and services, operating
income, staff, depreciation, amortization costs, net operating result and
interest expenses. If this information is not indicated in the profit and loss
account or in the explanatory notes it must be provided in the form of a self-
declaration.
2. Balance sheet statement — approved by the management, clearly indicating
the nature and the maturity (i.e. below or above one year) of receivables and
other current assets, grants, provisions and debts. If this information is not
indicated in the balance sheet or in the explanatory notes it must be provided
in the form of a self-declaration.
3. Explanatory notes and/or annexes that form part of the above financial
statements (if available).
4. External audit report or self-declaration
Participants requesting a grant amount of above 750 000 EUR (for action
grants) or above 100 000 EUR (for operating grants) must provide:
− an statutory audit report issued by an approved/certified external
auditor if:
− such a report is available or
− a statutory audit is required under EU or national law
or
27EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− a declaration on the validity of the accounts* (self-declaration), signed
by the legal representative of the entity, which certifies the validity of
the accounts.
The documents provided must cover the last two closed financial years. The most
recent year must have been closed within the last 18 months.
Exceptions are allowed for:
− start-up companies without closed annual accounts which provide
prospective data (business plan) for one year only
− recently created entities which have closed annual accounts for one year
only. These entities will be assessed based on the documents for the sole
closed financial year
A single financial document containing comparative data of the annual accounts of
both years under assessment will be accepted. The same applies to an external audit
report covering the two financial years.
If some (or all) of the documents have already been provided for the financial years
in question (i.e. uploaded in the Participant Register), the participant does not need
to submit them again.
The audit report must include:
− the clear mandate and scope of the audit
− the responsibilities of the management and the auditor
− the way in which the audit is carried out
− the auditor’s opinion, including a reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
All documents must be provided simultaneously (profit and loss account, balance
sheet, audit report/self-declaration, etc).
No audit report/self-declaration is needed for entities participating in tender
procedures, for natural persons and entities without closed accounts.
Specific cases
❖ Subsidiaries without own financial statements — Subsidiaries which do not
prepare their own financial statements may provide the consolidated accounts and
the audit report/self-declaration of the parent company/group they belong to under
the following conditions:
− the entity is exempt under national law from statutory audits
− only consolidated statements of the parent company/group the entity belongs
to are available
and
− the parent company assumes joint liability for all the debts of the entity (— all
conditions must be fulfilled).
In such cases, participants will be requested to provide additional documents to prove
these conditions.
28EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
❖ Parent companies — Parent companies which are exempt under national law
from publishing individual (i.e. non-consolidated) financial statements will be
requested to provide a dated and signed by the management simplified summary of
their non-consolidated profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
These simplified accounts must respect either the minimum reporting requirements
set out in the national accounting law or Annexes III, IV, V and VI of Directive
2013/349 (for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings
preceded by letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
If the provided financial information is not sufficiently clear, the Central Validation
Service may contact participants for further clarifications.
❖ Newly established enterprises that have not yet closed accounts — Must
provide estimated financial data (i.e. a business plan or a similar document including
financial projections on current and non-current assets, own capital, current and non-
current liabilities, turnover, operating and financial income and charges).
The financial data must respect either the minimum reporting requirements set out in
the national accounting law or to Annexes III, IV, V and VI of EU Directive 2013/34
(for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings preceded by
letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
❖ Natural persons engaged in an economic activity who do not prepare financial
statements in relation to their business activities — Are requested to provide:
− the annual income tax declaration containing details on the revenues and
expenses from business activity
− a signed declaration of patrimony, including:
− fixed patrimony (e.g. land, tenement, hereditament, medium/long-term
deposits (more than one year), stock options that cannot be exercised
within one year)
− current patrimony (e.g. available cash, savings, short-term deposits
(maximum of one year), stock-options that can be exercised within one
year)
and
− a signed declaration of debts, which must contain all liabilities (with dates and
figures), broken down in short-term debts (of maximum one year) and
medium/long-term debts (of more than one year).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities operating cash-based accounting — If the available financial
documents do not contain a profit and loss account and a balance sheet but are
limited to a cash flow statement and/or do not contain sufficient information10,
9 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual
financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of
undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and
repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19–76).
10 E.g. missing information on the nature of revenues, expenses or equity, nature and liquidity of
receivables and assets, maturity of debts etc.
29EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
declarations signed by the authorised legal representative of the entity may be
accepted, if they provide:
− information on fixed and current assets: buildings, equipment, inventory, cash,
short/long term11 deposits, short/long term receivables, sort/long term
liabilities, grants and equity/sources of funding, etc
− information on revenues and expenses, such as turnover from sales of goods
and services, operating income, staff expenses depreciation/amortisation
costs, interest expenses, etc.
In addition, it is recommended to provide any available evidence supporting the
declared amounts (e.g. bank statements confirming the available balance at
accounting closure date, etc).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities covered by a guarantor — Entities that are covered by a full financial
guarantee of another legal entity (i.e. guarantor) may submit the financial data of the
guarantor, provided that it is a full guarantee (i.e. the guarantor has assumed full
joint liability for all debts). Ad-hoc guarantees (covering, for instance, only the
participation in EU projects) cannot be accepted.
Participants that would like to have the financial capacity of their guarantor
assessed, must first contact the service in charge of their application for approval of
the guarantee. In case of approval, the service in charge will request the Central
Validation Service to proceed with the assessment of the guarantor.
4.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
If the financial documents do not contain sufficient information regarding the nature
and the maturity of the current assets, provisions and liabilities, and such information
is not provided, the financial assessment will be completed by taking the most
prudent approach, e.g. by considering the maturity of the current assets to be after
one year, and of the provisions and liabilities to be within one year.
11 Short term — maximum of one year; long term — more than one year.
30EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The financial assessment is valid for 18 months after the closure date of the most
recent assessed accounting period. If during this period the participant applies for
another grant or tender, the financial documents will not be requested again.
However, if there are justified grounds to doubt the financial capacity, a new
assessment may be triggered even before the end of the 18 months.
4.4 Modification of the assessment
In case of disagreement with the assessment, the participant may contact the Central
Validation Service by sending additional justifications via Participant Register
message. The subject of the message should be clearly labelled as related to the
financial assessment (not PIC validation, LEAR assessment or other).
The Central Validation Service will carry out a re-assessment on the basis of the
additional documents.
4.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant made false declarations, their status may be
changed.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants or procurements, their
participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
5. Ownership control assessment
5.1 Ownership control assessment: Criteria and conditions
For funding programmes which have restricted calls in which only participants which
are directly or indirectly controlled by EU Member States or by nationals of EU
Member States (or by entities or nationals of specified eligible countries) are eligible,
the Central Validation Service will also handle the ownership control assessment
analysis.
The ownership control assessment must in principle be done for each new grant,
procurement or contribution agreement (— unless the participant already has a valid
ownership control assessment in the system performed by the Central Validation
Service that is not older than 18 months).
Moreover, the ownership control may be assessed ad hoc if there are grounds
justifying a new assessment, like for example:
− indication of third country control from other sources
− indication of ownership control changes after the initial assessment.
31EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The ownership control assessment will usually look into both ownership and control
elements, in order to assess whether an entity is EU controlled or non-EU controlled.
The focus is however on control (see Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and
CEF-DIG restricted calls*).
In this context, ‘control’ will be defined as the possibility to exercise decisive influence
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate entities, ‘de jure’ or ‘de facto’.
The fact that no influence is actually exercised is not relevant, as long as the
possibility exists.
Control will be assessed at the level of the ultimate ownership and control line and all
intermediate layers (in case of indirect control), taking into consideration decision-
making mechanisms, corporate governance, shareholders’/members’ rights, etc.
The assessment is based on the information provided by the participant in the
ownership control declaration* (annexed to their application for EU funding or
procurement procedure) and supporting documents to be provided by the participant
during the ownership control assessment procedure.
The role of the Central Validation Service is limited to identifying instances of
possible non-EU-country/entity control (e.g. to collect and to analyse the supporting
documents). The final decision will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender
separately by the EU service in charge, in accordance with the specific programme
rules.If needed, during grant preparation, the EU service in charge may contact
participants about the outcome of the ownership control assessment.
5.2 Documents and information to provide
5.2.1 General requirements and principles
The ownership control assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by
the participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be
kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the
EU services at any time).
As a general rule, ownership control documents must be provided in their original
language. For documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit
an English free (unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in
non-EU languages, a free translation in English is mandatory and must be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
The participant assumes full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as the information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;

see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
5.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Graph visualising the complete ownership structure/chain of control, including
all ownership layers/chain of control until the ultimate owners.
2. Proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners and their respective
percentage of interest and voting rights, for instance commercial registry
extracts, articles of association/incorporation documents/memorandum of
association/company’s shareholders/members/partners book/registry extract,
etc with the exact distribution of shares/voting rights, i.e. name of
shareholders/members/partners and their percentage of interest andvoting
rights, as well as information on their place of establishment (in case of legal
entity) or nationality (in case of natural persons).
3. Statutes, articles of association, shareholders’/partnership agreements,
memorandum of understanding among shareholders, investment agreements
between shareholders and other relevant documents regarding the decision-
making procedures within the legal entity and the related rights of the
shareholders/members/partners.
4. Documents establishing/describing the decision-making bodies, rules regarding
election, appointment, nomination, dismissal and tenure of members, and
decision-making procedures (e.g. articles of association, bylaws, reports on
corporate governance, internal corporate governance rules, minutes of board
meetings, etc).
5. For participants that are listed companies, subsidiaries or controlled by a listed
company: report/minutes of the last three shareholders meetings, together
with the attendance list identifying the present/represented shareholders and
their respective votes.
6. Cooperation agreements with customers or suppliers, when they could confer
control over the participant — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
7. For shareholders/owners that provide financial contributions: supporting
documents (loans, by-laws, etc) that justify the financial contribution;
documents showing the link between the shareholder/owner and the entity
providing the financing — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
8. Information about any other means, process or links that could ultimately
confer control to a non-EU country or non-EU country entity.
9. Copy of ID card(s) or passport(s) indicating the nationality of the ultimate
owner(s).
The same documents and information must be provided for each intermediate
controlling entity, up to the ultimate owners. The supporting documents must
demonstrate the complete ownership structure, including all layers of ownership and
non-controlling entities.
33EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Guarantees for non-EU controlled entities (if allowed by the call conditions and
required by the EU service in charge) are not part of the ownership control
assessment and must therefore be submitted directly to the EU service in charge of
the grant/tender, in accordance with the specific programme rules.
5.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
not to finalise the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and
documents submitted or publicly available).
5.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The ownership control assessment is in principle valid for 18 months. If during this
period the participant applies for another grant or tender and confirms that the
ownership control status has not changed, the supporting documents will not be
requested again.
In this case, the participants will still have to submit the ownership control
declaration with the application, but there will be no check by the Central Validation
Service, unless there are justified grounds to doubt the declaration.
5.4 Modification of the assessment
Changes in the ownership control status need to be communicated to the granting
authority/contracting authority, which will trigger a new assessment by the Central
Validation Service, if needed.
For more information on the ownership control assessment procedure, see the
Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and CEF-DIG restricted calls*.

EU FUNDING & TENDERS PORTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE
1.1 The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is an electronic portal and exchange
system managed by the European Commission and used by itself and several
other EU services (together ‘EU’), for the management of EU funding/tenders (i.e.
grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, experts, etc).
1.2 It is currently open to:
− users applying for or managing EU grants, tenders and prizes
− entities entering into EU contribution agreements
− external experts and audit firms appointed to work for the EU in the
context of EU funding programmes
and allows them to:
− register (in the Participant Register or Expert Data Base) and view and
edit their data
− create, revise and submit proposals for funding and tenders
− prepare and sign contracts
− manage their projects and contracts (e.g. submit deliverables, reports
and payment requests)
− for experts: perform their tasks inside the system (evaluation,
monitoring, etc)
− for external audit firms: perform their tasks inside the system (audit
management).
1.3 These Terms and Conditions govern the relation between the following parties:
− the European Commission (as owner of the Portal)
and
− users
in relation to access and use of the Portal.
For the avoidance of doubt, it does not cover the terms and conditions related to
the grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements or expert contracts that
are managed through the Portal; those are governed by their own legal framework
and contractual arrangements.
1.4 Requesting access to the Portal, accessing the Portal or using the Portal signifies
unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
Users will be requested to agree explicitly to the Terms and Conditions on their first
login to the Portal.
For users acting on behalf of organisations, the legal representatives of the
organisations will also be asked to explicitly agree at the moment they appoint their
LEAR/EXAFs (through the ‘declaration of consent’; see below).
3EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Organisations must provide their LEAR/EXAFs, LSIGNs and FSIGNs with a copy of
these Terms and Conditions.
Users are responsible for regularly verifying the applicable Terms and Conditions.
1.5 These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the
European Commission and users, as regards the conditions for access and use of
the Portal.
2. ACCESS TO THE PORTAL
2.1 Users
2.1.1 Access to the public parts of the Portal is open to all users.
2.1.2 Access to the Portal electronic exchange system (EES) is open only to persons
with an EU Login account.
2.1.3 Access rights to certain information and functions in the EES are restricted to
users with specific roles (which are in turn linked to their functions within their
organisation or in relation to a particular
proposal/project/grant/contract/agreement).
2.1.4 Organisations can access the EES only via individual users employed by or
representing them.
2.2 Means of access to the EES — EU Login user account
2.2.1 Users must obtain an EU Login account in accordance with the applicable
procedures.
Users who already have an EU Login account must use that account.
2.2.2 Users guarantee that the information provided for registration for the account is
accurate and complete.
The European Commission has — at any time — the right to verify the accuracy
and validity of the information.
If this reveals any inaccuracy or invalidity, the European Commission has the right
to close the account and suspend or refuse access.
2.2.3 The means of access (i.e. the user name and password) are strictly personal and
users are responsible for safeguarding their confidentiality and security, and
ensuring their appropriate use.
Users undertake to take all steps to prevent any unauthorised third party from
gaining knowledge and making use thereof.
Users may not transfer or sell their means of access to third parties.
Users must notify the European Commission immediately (via the IT Helpdesk;
see Funding & Tenders Portal Support menu) of the loss, theft, breach of
confidentiality or any risk of misuse of the means of access.
If the European Commission has any reason to suspect that the confidentiality or
security of the means of access has been breached or that the EES is being
misused, it may — without prior notice — suspend or refuse access.

2.4 LEAR appointment
2.4.1 Organisations using the EES for transactions requiring electronic signatures are
required to appoint a LEAR.
2.4.2 Individuals (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons) will automatically have the
role of LEAR (no appointment needed); but they will have to provide the
supporting documents. Organisations can appoint only one LEAR — who can be
replaced if necessary, following the same appointment process.
2.4.3 Organisations warrant that the person appointed as LEAR is duly authorised to
represent them in relation to all LEAR responsibilities.
Organisations are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of the LEAR
responsibilities and to ensure that the LEAR remains at all times duly authorised
to represent them in relation to these responsibilities.
2.4.4 Supporting documents must be provided directly in the system.
2.4.5 Signed originals must be kept on file for controls (which may take place at any
moment and independently of any ongoing grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements or expert contracts).
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to the closure of the EU Login

2.5 Appointment of signatories in the EES — (P)LSIGNs and (P)FSIGNs
2.5.1 The LEAR must appoint one or more LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation.
2.5.2 The LEAR and its organisation warrant that the persons appointed as LSIGNs or
FSIGNs are duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to all LSIGN
or FSIGN responsibilities.
The LEAR and its organisation are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of
the LSIGN and FSIGN responsibilities and to ensure that the LSIGNs and FSIGNs
remain at all times duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to
these responsibilities.
2.5.3 The CoCo or PaCo must appoint the PLSIGNs and PFSIGNs for individual grants
procurements and contribution agreements from the list of LSIGNs and FSIGNs for
their organisation.
2.6 Data updates on the EES roles
2.6.1 The LEAR is responsible for keeping data related to the organisation roles up-to-
date.
2.6.2 The CoCo/PaCo are responsible for keeping data related to the project roles up-to-
date.
2.7 Deactivation of old e-mail addresses/accounts
2.7.1 The LEAR has the ultimate responsibility for overseeing that old e-mail
addresses/user accounts are deactivated and removed from the organisation- and
project roles.
2.8 General obligation to channel information to the right addressees
2.8.1 If made aware of misled communications, the LEAR has the obligation to re-direct
them and ensure proper follow-up and correction for the future.
3. USING THE PORTAL

(c) submit information or materials that infringe third party rights, are
libellous, obscene, threatening or otherwise unlawful.
3.1.4 Users are fully and unconditionally responsible for any use of the Portal (including
misuse of their means of access), and for any detrimental consequences that may
arise directly or indirectly therefrom.
3.1.5 Organisations acknowledge and accept that they are responsible for the actions
and omissions of persons employed by or representing them, acting as users of
the Portal.
3.1.6 Users are liable for — and will indemnify and hold harmless the European
Commission against — any damage that results from:
− changes made to the Portal or
− use of the Portal in a manner that does not correspond with these Terms and
Conditions.
3.2 Required hardware, software and services
3.2.1 Users acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for the choice, purchase
and operation of hardware, software and telecommunication services required to
connect with and to use the Portal.
Such hardware, software and telecommunication services must meet the
minimum requirements, as specified on the Portal (if any).
Users are responsible for the installation and costs of purchasing and licensing
such hardware, software or telecommunication services.
3.2.2 The European Commission is not liable for hardware, software, products and
services of third parties (such as telecommunication equipment, internet
connections, operating systems and internet browsers).
3.3 Electronic notifications and signatures in the EES
3.3.1 Users acknowledge and accept that under these Terms and Conditions and in line
with the EU Financial Regulation1:
(a) data sent or received through the EES enjoys legal presumption of the
integrity of the data and the accuracy of the date and time of sending or
receiving (as indicated by the EES logs)
(b) a document sent or notified through the EES is considered as equivalent
to a paper document, is admissible as evidence in legal proceedings, is
deemed original and enjoys legal presumption of its authenticity and
integrity, provided it does not contain any dynamic features capable of
automatically changing it
(c) electronic signatures made by users through the EES have the
equivalent legal effect of handwritten signatures.
1 See Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18
July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union (OJ L 193,

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
3.3.2 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) any communication or document sent or notified using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper document with a handwritten signature and shall be
admissible as evidence in legal proceedings and constitute sufficient
evidence in legal proceedings
(b) any declaration, contract (or amendment) signed using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper declaration/contract with a handwritten signature and shall
be admissible as evidence in legal proceedings and constitute sufficient
evidence in legal proceedings
(c) they cannot dispute:
(i) the existence or validity of any communication, document,
declaration or contract signed using any type of electronic
signature through the EES or
(ii) the admissibility of any communication, document, declaration or
contract submitted or signed through the EES as evidence in legal
proceedings, solely on the basis that such communication,
document, declaration or contract was submitted electronically
through the EES or signed with an electronic signature.
3.3.3 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) communications in the EES are generally considered to have been made
when they are sent by the sending party (i.e. on the date and time they
are sent through the EES, as indicated by the time logs)
(b) where formal notifications are required, these are considered to have
been made when they are received by the receiving party (i.e. on the
date and time they are accessed in the EES by the receiving party, as
indicated by the time logs); formal notifications that have not been
accessed within 10 calendar days after sending are considered to have
been accessed.
3.3.4 The European Commission registers access and use of the EES.
This access and use log provides evidence that access and use has been made of
EES, unless users can prove the contrary.
3.3.5 Electronic messages, connections, operations on the network and transactions
between the EU and the users shall be proven using the logs and transaction files
kept electronically by the European Commission.
Users accept the evidential value of this data.
This does not prevent the parties from providing other proof, using permitted
legal methods (such as proof on paper).
3.4 Intellectual property rights
3.4.1 The intellectual and industrial property rights and know-how associated with the
Portal belong exclusively to the European Commission and its licensors.
Only the European Commission has the right to correct errors.

licence to use the Portal for their own professional purposes (unless access is
suspended or refused).

protection of computer programs (which cannot be contractually denied), users
may not in any way:
(a) modify, translate or adapt the Portal
(b) decompile or disassemble the Portal
(c) copy the Portal (or parts of it)
(d) pass on, dispose of, grant as a sub-licence, lease, lend or distribute the

the European Commission reserves the right to cancel calls without entitlement to
compensation.
3.6 Suspension and refusal of access
3.6.1 Users acknowledge that the European Commission may refuse access to a user
logging in, if a session is already open on another computer where another user is
using the same means of access (i.e. the same EU Login account name and
password).
3.6.2 Users acknowledge and accept that the European Commission may suspend or
refuse access to the Portal:
(a) in case of suspected or actual breach of these Terms and Conditions
(b) if the information provided for the registration for an EU Login account is

name and password) have been breached or compromised or that the
Portal is being misused (clause 2.2.3)
(d) in case of fraudulent practices
(e) if the IT systems of the European Commission are being attacked

(h) for preventive, corrective or routine maintenance and
(i) in any other situation where the European Commission considers that
suspension or refusal of access is reasonably required or desirable.

the suspension or refusal of access.
4. MISCELLANEOUS

other EU service shall be liable for any direct or indirect damage of any kind

savings, or goodwill), except in the event of wilful misconduct.
To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, neither the European
Commission nor any other EU service can be held liable for gross negligence.
Neither the European Commission nor any other EU service are responsible or
liable for any damage in case of force majeure, external cause or any other events
which are not under their reasonable control.
4.4 Interpretation
4.4.1 These Terms and Conditions have been drawn up in English and its provisions will
be interpreted and construed in accordance with applicable law (see clause 4.6)
and their generally accepted meanings in the English language.
Any translation of these Terms and Conditions is for the convenience of the
parties only, and shall not be binding towards any party.
In the event of any inconsistency between the English original and its translation,
the provisions of the English version shall prevail.
4.4.2 For participants that are international organisations, nothing in these Terms and
Conditions shall constitute, be deemed or construed as a waiver or modification of
their privileges or immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or
international law.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.4.3 International organisations that have also concluded a financial framework
partnership agreement with the EU, may moreover rely on the provisions set out
in that framework agreement— provided they do not call into question the lawful
access and use of the Portal in line with the intended purposes set out in the

4.4.4 If a provision of these Terms and Conditions is or becomes invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, it shall (if possible and insofar as it is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) be replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable clause that reflects
the initial intentions as closely as possible.
If the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision cannot be validly replaced, no

these Terms and Conditions, without affecting or invalidating the remaining

of these Terms and Conditions.
4.5.2 Users acknowledge and agree that such new terms and conditions enter into force

Conditions shall be deemed accepted by them as from the first time they access
or use the Portal after the date of entry into force of the new Terms and
Conditions.
4.6 Termination
4.6.1 These Terms and Conditions shall be deemed terminated vis-à-vis a user in case:
− the European Commission no longer makes available the Portal or
− of refusal of access pursuant to clause 3.6.
4.6.2 Those clauses that by their nature are expressly or implicitly intended to survive
the termination or expiry of these Terms and Conditions shall so survive, including
but not limited to clauses 2.4.3, 3.3, 3.5, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.7.
4.7 Applicable law and dispute settlement
4.7.1 For issues closely linked to a grant, procurement, prize, contribution agreement or
expert contract managed through the Portal, the applicable law and dispute
settlement forum are that of the legal framework/contractual arrangement
relating to the grant, procurement, prize, contribution agreement or expert
contract.
4.7.2 For issues relating to these Terms and Conditions, the Portal and access or use of
its electronic exchange system (EES), the applicable law shall be EU law,
supplemented if necessary by the law of Belgium.
15EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024

For such issues, the General Court — or on appeal the Court of Justice of the
European Union — shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes, if they
cannot be settled amicably.
For participants that are international organisations, the applicable law shall be
the general principles governing the law of international organisations and the
general rules of international law. For disputes with such participants, the

for Arbitration published on the Portal, if they cannot be settled amicably. There
will be no possibility for interim measures or pre-award relief.
