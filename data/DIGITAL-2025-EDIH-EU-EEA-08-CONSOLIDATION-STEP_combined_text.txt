According to the Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU classified information, “European Union
classified information (EUCI) means any information or material designated by an EU security classification, the unauthorised disclosure of which could cause varying
degrees of prejudice to the interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States”.
3
Classified background information is information that is already classified by a country and/or international organisation and/or the EU and is going to be used by the
project. In this case, the project must have in advance the authorisation from the originator of the classified information, which is the entity (EU institution, EU Member
State, third state or international organisation) under whose authority the classified information has been generated.
4
EU classified foreground information is information (documents/deliverables/materials) planned to be generated by the project and that needs to be protected from
unauthorised disclosure. The originator of the EUCI generated by the project is the European Commission.

Work packages
,
This section concerns a detailed description of the project activities. e
Group your activities into work packages. A work package means a major sub-division of the project. For each work package, enter an objective (expected outcome) and list the activities,
milestones and deliverables that belong to it. The grouping should bel logical and guided by identifiable outputs.
p
Projects should normally have a minimum of 2 work packages. WP1 should cover the management and coordination activities (meetings, coordination, project monitoring and evaluation, financial
management, progress reports, etc) and all the activities which are cross-cutting and therefore difficult to assign to another specific work package (do not try splitting these activities across
different work packages). WP2 and further WPs should be usmed for the other project activities. You can create as many work packages as needed by copying WP1.
For very simple projects, it is possible to use a single work package for the entire project (WP1 with the project acronym as WP name).
Work packages covering financial support to third paarties ( only allowed if authorised in the Call document) must describe the conditions for implementing the support (for grants: max amounts
per third party; criteria for calculating the exact amounts, types of activity that qualify (closed list), persons/categories of persons to be supported and criteria and procedures for giving support; for
prizes: eligibility and award criteria, amount of thxe prize and payment arrangements).
Enter each activity/milestone/output/ouEtcome/deliverable only once (under one work package).
Ensure consistency with the detailed budget table/calculator (if applicable). (n/a for prefixed Lump Sum Grants)

Activities and division of work (WP description)
l
Provide a concise overview of the work (planned tasks). Be specific and give a short name and number for each task. p
Show who is participating in each task: Coordinator (COO), Beneficiaries (BEN), Affiliated Entities (AE), Associated Partners (AP), indicating in bold the task leader.
m
Add information on other participants’ involvement in the project e.g. subcontractors, in-kind contributions.
Note:
In-kind contributions: In-kind contributions for free are cost-neutral, i.e. cannot be declared as cost. Please indicate the ion-kind contributions that are provided in the context of the work package.
The Coordinator remains fully responsible for the coordination tasks, even if they are delegated to someone else. Coordinator tasks cannot be subcontracted.
If there is subcontracting, please also complete the table below.
c
Milestones and deliverables (outputs/outcomes) o
Milestones are control points in the project that help to chart progress (e.g. completion of a key dteliverable allowing the next phase of the work to begin). Use them only for major outputs in
complex projects, otherwise leave the section empty. Please limit the number of milestones by work package.
Means of verification are how you intend to prove that a milestone has been reached. If approptriate, you can also refer to indicators.
Deliverables are project outputs which are submitted to show project progress (any format). Refer only to major outputs. Do not include minor sub-items, internal working papers, meeting minutes,
o
etc. Limit the number of deliverables to max 10-15 for the entire project. You may be asked to further reduce the number during grant preparation.
For deliverables such as meetings, events, seminars, trainings, workshops, webinanrs, conferences, etc., enter each deliverable separately and provide the following in the 'Description' field:
invitation, agenda, signed presence list, target group, number of estimated participants, duration of the event, report of the event, training material package, presentations, evaluation report,
feedback questionnaire.
For deliverables such as manuals, toolkits, guides, reports, leaflets, brochure,s, training materials etc., add in the ‘Description’ field: format (electronic or printed), language(s), approximate number
of pages and estimated number of copies of publications (if any). e
For each deliverable you will have to indicate a due month by when you commit to upload it in the Portal. The due month of the deliverable cannot be outside the duration of the work package and
must be in line with the timeline provided below. Month 1 marks the sltart of the project and all deadlines should be related to this starting date.

Subcontracting
E
Give details on subcontracted project tasks (if any) and explain the reasons why (as opposed to direct implementation by the Beneficiaries/Affiliated Entities).
Subcontracting — Subcontracting means the implementation of ‘action tasks’, i.e. specific tasks which are part of the EU grant and are described in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement.
Note: Subcontracting concerns the outsourcing of a part of the project to a party outside the consortium. It is not simply about purchasing goods or services. We normally expect that the participants
have sufficient operational capacity to implement the project activities themselves. Subcontracting should therefore be exceptional.

1. Background
The focus of this call is the consolidation of the network of European Digital
Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) aiming to cover all regions of the European Union and
Associated Countries, including the EU’s outermost regions as defined in Article 349 of
the TFEU, through the support to private and public organisations in their digital
transformation, as a means for the large-scale AI deployment aimed by the upcoming
AI Continent Communication planned for adoption on 9 April 2025 and ensuing Apply
AI strategy planned for the second half of 2025.
A European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) is a single entity or a coordinated group of
entities with complementary expertise and a not-for-profit objective to support on a
large scale the digital transformation of (1) SMEs and mid-caps, and/or (2) public sector
organisations conducting non-economic activities. EDIHs provide services such as
testing before investing, training and skills development, support to find investments,
networking, and access to innovation ecosystems. EDIHs are essential to diffuse AI
technologies and to support AI ecosystem both for the companies building the
technologies and for those making use of them. In their second phase of operations,
they will focus on AI technologies as offering unprecedented opportunities for growth
and competitiveness and offer a first-line AI help desk to businesses and public sector
organisations, including basic information on compliance with the AI Act as well relevant
sources of further information.
The initial network of EDIHs was established through a two-step selection process. First,
Member States and countries associated to DEP designated EDIH candidates through a
national process. Secondly, the European Commission launched restricted calls for
proposals in which only designated EDIH candidates were eligible to participate. The
network was therefore formed based on three calls organised in 2022, 2023 and 2024.
The call in 2024 specifically targeted seven countries associated to DEP that had not
participated in the previous two calls.
Artificial intelligence is a specific focus for the EDIH network. 9 out of 10 EDIHs already
offer today services related to these technologies. Recognizing AI’s transformative
potential and contribution to the digitalisation of SMEs and the public sector, the EDIH
network must further prioritize integrating AI technologies into the vast majority of

EDIHs’ core activities, by delivering services that span from data acquisition and
structuring to exploitation for greater competitiveness, in combination with other digital
innovations. The EDIHs will also leverage AI solutions to significantly enhance their own
activities, thereby increasing their impact with stakeholders in both the private and
public sectors. AI technologies will allow the EDIHs to provide more effective services,
from automating routine tasks to enabling advance data analytics to monitor the Digital
Maturity of their clients, which can offer deeper insights and drive better tailored
services.
This call is open only to eligible EDIHs (see more details in section 6) which are
existing EDIHs funded by the Digital Europe Programme and EDIHs with a Seal of
Excellence as listed in the Commission Implementing Decision 2023/1534 establishing
the Initial Network of EDIHs, in Annex I (List of European Digital Innovation Hubs
retained for funding by the Digital Europe Programme) and Annex II (List of European
Digital Innovation Hubs with a Seal of Excellence). The candidate EDIH will indicate as
previous proposal the number and acronym of the original EDIH as listed in the Annexes
of the Decision.
All countries will have an allocated budget envelope for the EDIHs on their territory. As
EDIHs in a country will only compete with EDIHs of the same country, Calls may be
open for some geographies and not others.
After consulting with Digital Europe Programme Committee, this call is only open for
eligible EDIHs in the territories listed in section 6. Additional calls with cover the
countries (including for other associated countries to DEP) which are not part of the
current Call, as well as the countries for which there will remain gaps, pending the
remaining budget allocation.
Recognising the importance of Strategic Technologies for the Union’s economic
security5, this call supports the strengthening of deployment of critical technologies,
such as AI, across industry and value chains, further fostering deep tech innovations
with significant economic potential. As a consequence, a STEP Seal will be awarded
to applicants that passed all evaluation thresholds, including the EDIHs that
remain unfunded due to budget limitations in the Digital Europe Program. The highest-
ranked will receive DEP funding of up to 50%, with the remainder to be covered by
national, regional or private funding. Unfunded EDIHs with a STEP Seal may receive
funding by Member States or regions without additional evaluation, and, if operational,
will be recognised as European Digital Innovation Hub in their own right and will be
integrated as full members of the EDIH network.
The EDIH network will be supported by a strengthened Digital Transformation
Accelerator, which will provide services such as community building, training,
networking, impact assessment, communication, coordination and connection to
relevant initiatives.
The governance of the network will continue involving the Member States through the
AI Board, notably the AI Innovation Ecosystem subgroup.

Objectives
The objective of this call is the consolidation of the network of European Digital
Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) aiming to cover all regions of the European Union and
Associated Countries by strengthening its performance and capacity to meet local,
regional, national and European digitalisation needs.
With increased experience and capacities, the EDIHs will continue providing the
complete set of services of an EDIH, including the necessary infrastructure, focusing
primarily on specific geographical areas and covering the digital transformation needs
of local SMEs, mid-caps and/or public sector organisations. Considering the
transformation potential of AI technologies, these will be a reinforced focus of EDIHs’
operations under this call.
The consolidation of the EDIHs network will be pivotal in supporting the wide
deployment and uptake of European AI technologies, solutions and tools and in
promoting the adoption of other crucial digital technologies, while upholding Union
values and human-centric perspective.
Furthermore, the network will harness the potential of green digital technologies,
advancing Europe’s collective climate and environmental goals. This approach not only
enhances the resilience of Europe’s industry but also boosts its strategic autonomy.
With its enhanced presence in countries associated to Digital Europe, the EDIH network
will help bridge technology gaps, and support competitiveness and economic
convergence.
European AI innovation ecosystems
EDIHs are part of the AI innovation ecosystems in the EU which also encompass
infrastructures such as AI Factories6, AI Testing and Experimentation Facilities7 (TEFs),
AI on Demand Platform8 implemented through the Deploy AI Initiative9, and the
forthcoming AI skills Academy, Generative AI pilots for public administrations and AI
Regulatory sandboxes.
The EDIHs will closely collaborate with European AI innovation infrastructures, in
particular with AI factories, the AI-on-demand platform and AI Testing and
Experimentation Facilities to ensure a flexible journey for European companies to
benefit fully from these AI innovation infrastructures.
Scope
Each EDIH will provide services based on a specific focus and expertise, which will
support the local private and public sector with their digital transformation with
particular focus on support to development, training deployment and uptake of
European AI. This specialisation can be strengthened over time and should make use
of existing local competencies in this area.

Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs with reinforced AI focus)]
EU Grants: Call document (DEP): V1.0 – 01.04.2025
The EDIH network is dedicated to promoting and facilitating the digital transformation
of SMEs and public services through four types of services:
• Test before invest: providing access to technical expertise and
experimentation facilities, in particular to AI-related services.
• Training and skill development: offering training sessions to SMEs and
public services for upskilling and reskilling of the workforce, including on the
adoption and use of AI technologies.
• Support to identify and facilitate access to potential financing sources to
support digital transformation.
• Foster an innovation ecosystem and networking opportunities
Each EDIH is expected to provide all four types of services. They can however have
different weights in the overall services portfolio. The services will be provided on an
open, transparent and non-discriminatory basis and will be targeted mainly to (1) SMEs
and mid-caps and/or (2) public sector organisations conducting non-economic
activities.
Each EDIH will act as an access point to the European network of EDIHs, helping local
companies and/or public actors to get support from other EDIHs in case the needed
competences fall outside their remit, ensuring that every stakeholder gets the needed
support wherever it is available in Europe. Reversely, each EDIH will support the
companies and public actors from other regions and countries presented by other EDIHs
that need their expertise. The EDIHs will also serve as contact point for the AI
innovation infrastructures as described above, notably the AI factories, AI-on-demand
platform and TEFs, and offer a first-line AI help desk to businesses and public sector
organisations, including basic information on compliance with the AI Act as well relevant
sources of further information and ensuring a broad adoption of strategic technologies
supporting the development of an AI continent. These helpdesks by EDIHs shall further
coordinate with the DTA on replies and new questions on the AI Act.
Each EDIH will make available the relevant experimentation facilities and demonstrators
related to its specialisation. SMEs, mid-caps and the public sector will be able to
demonstrate, prototype and test the technologies proposed, including where relevant
their environmental impact, and the feasibility of applying these technologies to their
business before further investing in it. Likewise, EDIHs will harness the potential of
green digital technologies, advancing Europe’s collective climate and environmental
goals.
EDIHs will also provide access to finance services including providing information and
facilitating access to public and private funding sources as well as to public and private
investors.
The EDIHs will be active in networking with other hubs, sharing best practices and
specialist knowledge, in bringing companies into contact with other companies of their
value chain, and in seeking synergies with innovators and early adopters that test
solutions in novel experiments and can foster the adoption of digital technologies, and
notably AI, in working and business environments in a more human-friendly way. EDIHs
will also play a brokering role between public administrations and companies providing
e-government technologies.
In all the networking activities, EDIHs will be supported by the Digital Transformation
Accelerator (DTA) and therefore it is compulsory that EDIHs participate actively in the
relevant support activities of the Digital Transformation Accelerator, such as
matchmaking, training and capacity building events. The Digital Transformation
Accelerator in cooperation with the Commission will also host tools, such as the Digital
Maturity Assessment Tool, and have the role to centralise overall Key Performance
9Call: [DIGITAL-2025-EDIH-CONSOLIDATION-EU-EEA-08-STEP — Consolidation of the Network of European
Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs with reinforced AI focus)]
EU Grants: Call document (DEP): V1.0 – 01.04.2025
Indicators (KPIs) of the network, and therefore each EDIH will report the necessary
information to the DTA. EDIHs are encouraged to make use of the digital tools provided
but are also free to use their own tools. However, interoperability with the EDIH network
tools is a requirement, so that users of the EDIHs will have a seamless experience.
DTA will organize events and activities for the network of EDIH, to share information
and experiences, train, build cohesion. EDIHs should foresee active participation in
those events and activities.
EDIHs will collaborate with the EU AI Innovation infrastructures and will become a
central point for companies and public sector ensuring a flexible and seamless digital
journey and referring them to the services provided by these AI innovation
infrastructures where appropriate. This collaboration does NOT mean that EDIHs need
to integrate a representative of each EU AI infrastructures in their own consortium. It
means that EDIHs have to map out these infrastructures, establish contacts with them
and help their customer benefit from the services provided by the other initiatives in a
client journey perspective. These collaborations will not only accelerate the deployment
of AI technologies but also ensure that these technologies are applied effectively and
ethically. EDIHs will play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between AI research and
real-world applications, driving economic growth and improving public services across
Europe.
The EDIHs will act as a multiplier and widely diffuse the use of all the digital capacities
built up under the different specific objectives of the Digital Europe Programme and
including the effective use of key digital standards. To the extent possible, the EDIHs
should use the AI solutions of European start-ups and SMEs and/or those provided and
stemming from EU projects, including from the AI-on-Demand Platform.
Highlighting the vital importance to strengthen the value chains of critical digital
technologies, the EDIHs should closely collaborate with AI Factories as well as with the
High-Performance Computing competence centres. Where relevant, the EDIHs will
facilitate access for their customers to the EuroHPC AI-optimised supercomputers. They
will also help SMEs fine-tune available AI solutions to their business needs and use
cases by providing, wherever needed, also access to AI training.
It should be avoided that there is duplication of actions of the other AI innovation
infrastructures and the EDIHs, and therefore working arrangements will be agreed
among them, where the focus of the EDIHs will be on their role as multiplier and
reaching out to all regions in Europe. Proposals will describe the planned delivery of AI
services and referral mechanisms.
EDIHs will maintain structured long-term relationships with the relevant local actors
like regional authorities, industrial clusters, SME associations, business development
agencies, incubators, accelerators, chambers of commerce, and partners of the
Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), Cybersecurity Centers and Startup Europe by
offering joint investor-related events, organising common trainings, workshops or info
days, referring SMEs from EEN to EDIHs and from EDIHs to EEN according to their
specific needs. It is expected that local actors planning mutual support with a local EDIH
will sign a Memorandum of Understanding for a proper governance of their
collaboration10.

EU Grants: Call document (DEP): V1.0 – 01.04.2025
Additionally, EDIHs will serve as an interface for the European Commission to support
the implementation of specific sectorial policies, SME policies and eGovernment policies.
This will imply that EDIHs specialised in a specific sector could be consulted on policies
related to their sector of competence and could participate in specific actions.
EDIHs will design operations to achieve sustainability level beyond the implementation
and will indicate how they will build local capacity, foster community ownership, and
integrate the initiative into their ecosystems.
Price list
Proposals have to include a list of the services to be provided to SMEs and public sector,
and make available online. The list will enumerate the services by category, indicating
the target clients, the nominal service price, the amount of State aid passed on by the
EDIHs and the remaining amount that the clients have to pay, if applicable. A first list
is a requirement in the proposal.
This list is necessary to comply with the State aid regulations, even when the services
will be offered for free or at a discount, as explained in the Work Programme, Appendix
6. In case the price list will be modified in terms of e.g., new services, updated prices
or discount conditions, the new price list will be made public online and will be included
in the periodic report.
The total public funding for this action may be up to 100% of eligible costs (50% coming
from the Digital Europe Programme and up to 50% coming from the Member States).
Proposals will describe their co-funding sources (e.g. public funding and remaining
amounts to be paid by customers) and how they will achieve economic sustainability
for their operations. In line with Appendix 6 on State Aid, Member States have to ensure
that State aid is granted in line with the applicable State aid rules, such as de minimis
or GBER (ensuring compliance with GBER compatibility conditions, including on aid
intensities and notification thresholds set out in Article 4 GBER).
Continuation from previous achievements
This Call reinforces the continuation of EDIH services started either as an EDIH co-
funded by the Programme or as an EDIH with a Seal of Excellence. Proposals will clearly
describe how the proposal builds on previous achievements and learns from past
experience to ensure an efficient implementation (addressed e.g. under the Maturity
sub-criterion) and even greater impact.
Outcomes and deliverables
Each EDIH will support the digital transformation of SMEs, mid-caps, and public sector
organizations within its geographical area and area of expertise, while also aiming to
extend its impact beyond its immediate region. An EDIH can select to focus on specific
group(s) of clients (e.g. mainly SMEs or mainly public sector).
Each selected project will provide the four core types of services (testing before
investing, training and skills development, support to find investments, networking and
access to innovation ecosystems) covering a wide range of digitalisation needs, from
mainstream technologies and AI capacities to specialised technologies. The services will
be provided seamlessly, through proxies when required, maintaining consistency and
accessibility for stakeholders. EDIHs complement and build synergies with existing
regional and national initiatives, collaborate with the EU AI Innovation infrastructures
and will become a central point for companies and public sector ensuring a flexible and
seamless digital journey and referring them to the services provided by these AI
innovation infrastructures where appropriate.

All together, EDIHs will contribute to consolidation of a balanced network of EDIHs,
ensuring the broadest coverage of regions in Europe, addressing the needs of public
and private sectors across all economic sectors, fostering cross-regional collaboration
and resource sharing and offering a wide range of digitalisation services, from
mainstream to specialised technologies.
Each EDIH will carry out Digital Maturity Assessments for their clients, using the tools
provided by the Commission and DTA, and deliver services leading to greater
digitalisation of their clients as well as to their adoption of AI. While not all services
need to be preceded by a Digital Maturity Assessment, EDIHs are encouraged to use it
as often as practically possible.
KPIs to measure outcomes and deliverables
The following indicators will be used to evaluate the performance of the hub; proposals
should define their indicators as well as the targets related to each of them:
• Number of entities which have used the European Digital Innovation Hubs’
services, by user category (businesses of different sizes, public sector
entities, etc.), sector, location, by technology and type of service received
(test-before-invest, training, access to finance, networking). Specific sub-
indicators have to be proposed when the services are related to develop
and uptake AI solutions, and will include a description of which European AI
Innovation Infrastructures have been used (such as the AI-on-Demand
platform) or referred to (such as the AI Factories).
• Number of entity referral to European AI Innovation Infrastructures
• For access to finance: amount of additional investments successfully
triggered (e.g. through venture capital, bank loan, etc.).
• Number of collaborations foreseen with other EDIHs and stakeholders
outside the region at EU level, and description of jointly shared
infrastructures / joint investments with other EDIHs.
A set of additional impact indicators will be collected and analysed with the support of
the Digital Transformation Accelerator:
• Increase in digital maturity of organizations that have used the services of
the EDIH network. Digital maturity will be defined on the basis of a
questionnaire assessing the categories of digital strategy and readiness,
intelligence and automation, data and connectedness, sustainable and
human-centric digitalisation. EDIHs will administer the questionnaire at the
start of the engagement with a client, and later after having delivered
services, and report without delay the results to the DTA repository. An
updated simpler questionnaire is being developed by the Joint Research
Centre.
• Increase in number of companies benefiting from the use of European AI
technology.
Targeted stakeholders
A European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) is a single entity or a coordinated group of
entities with complementary expertise and a not-for-profit objective to support on a
large scale the digital transformation of companies (especially SMEs and mid-caps)
and/or public sector organisations.
Typical entities contributing to an EDIH will be tech and business developers with
experience in digitalisation and digital innovations, research & technology organisation
(RTO) or university labs offering technology services (beyond academic R&I), which
could work in collaboration with partners whose expertise lies in business financing,
public sector innovation or training such as for example chambers of commerce,

Eligible activities
Applications will only be considered eligible if their content corresponds wholly (or at
least in part) to the topic description for which they are submitted.
Eligible activities are the ones set out in section 2 above.
Projects should take into account the results of projects supported by other EU funding
programmes. The complementarities must be described in the project proposals (Part
B of the Application Form).
Projects must comply with EU policy interests and priorities (such as environment,
social, security, industrial and trade policy, etc). Projects must also respect EU values
and European Commission policy regarding reputational matters (e.g. activities
involving capacity building, policy support, awareness raising, communication,
dissemination, etc).
Financial support to third parties is not allowed.
Ethics
Projects must comply with:
− highest ethical standards and
− applicable EU, international and national law (including the General Data
Protection Regulation 2016/679).
Proposals under this call will have to undergo an ethics review to authorise funding and
may be made subject to specific ethics rules (which become part of the Grant
Agreement in the form of ethics deliverables, e.g. ethics committee
opinions/notifications/authorisations required under national or EU law).
For proposals involving development, testing, deployment, use or distribution of AI
systems, the ethics review will in particular check compliance with the principles of
human agency and oversight, diversity/fairness, transparency and responsible social
impact, while the experts performing the technical evaluation will assess the robustness
of the AI systems (i.e. their reliability not to cause unintentional harm).
Security
Projects involving EU classified information must undergo security scrutiny to authorise
funding and may be made subject to specific security rules (detailed in a security
aspects letter (SAL) which is annexed to the Grant Agreement).

EU Grants: Call document (DEP): V1.0 – 01.04.2025
These rules (governed by Decision 2015/44417 and its implementing rules and/or
national rules) provide for instance that:
− projects involving information classified TRES SECRET UE/EU TOP SECRET (or
equivalent) can NOT be funded
− classified information must be marked in accordance with the applicable security
instructions in the SAL
− information with classification levels CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL or
above (and RESTREINT UE/ EU RESTRICTED, if required by national rules) may
be:
− created or accessed only on premises with facility security clearance
(FSC) from the competent national security authority (NSA), in
accordance with the national rules
− handled only in a secured area accredited by the competent NSA
− accessed and handled only by persons with valid personnel security
clearance (PSC) and a need-to-know
− at the end of the grant, the classified information must either be returned or
continue to be protected in accordance with the applicable rules
− action tasks involving EU classified information (EUCI) may be subcontracted
only with prior written approval from the granting authority and only to entities
established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission)
− disclosure of EUCI to third parties is subject to prior written approval from the
granting authority.
Please note that, depending on the type of activity, facility security clearance may have
to be provided before grant signature. The granting authority will assess the need for
clearance in each case and will establish their delivery date during grant preparation.
Please note that in no circumstances can we sign any grant agreement until at least
one of the beneficiaries in a consortium has facility security clearance.
Further security recommendations may be added to the Grant Agreement in the form
of security deliverables (e.g. create security advisory group, limit level of detail, use
fake scenario, exclude use of classified information, etc).
Beneficiaries must ensure that their projects are not subject to national/third-country
security requirements that could affect implementation or put into question the award
of the grant (e.g. technology restrictions, national security classification, etc). The
granting authority must be notified immediately of any potential security issues.
7. Financial and operational capacity and exclusion
Financial capacity
Applicants must have stable and sufficient resources to successfully implement the
projects and contribute their share. Organisations participating in several projects must
have sufficient capacity to implement all projects.
The financial capacity check will be carried out on the basis of the documents you will
be requested to upload in the Participant Register during grant preparation (e.g. profit
17 See Commission Decision 2015/444/EU, Euratom of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting
EU classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p. 53).

and loss account and balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an
approved external auditor, certifying the accounts for the last closed financial year,
etc). The analysis will be based on neutral financial indicators, but will also take into
account other aspects, such as dependency on EU funding and deficit and revenue in
previous years.
The check will normally be done for all beneficiaries, except:
− public bodies (entities established as public body under national law, including
local, regional or national authorities) or international organisations
− if the individual requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60 000.
If needed, it may also be done for affiliated entities.
If we consider that your financial capacity is not satisfactory, we may require:
− further information
− an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility
for all beneficiaries or joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see below,
section 10)
− prefinancing paid in instalments
− (one or more) prefinancing guarantees (see below, section 10)
or
− propose no prefinancing
− request that you are replaced or, if needed, reject the entire proposal.
For more information, see Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Operational capacity
Applicants must have the know-how, qualifications and resources to successfully
implement the projects and contribute their share (including sufficient experience in
projects of comparable size and nature).
This capacity will be assessed together with the ‘Implementation’ award criterion, on
the basis of the competence and experience of the applicants and their project teams,
including operational resources (human, technical and other) or, exceptionally, the
measures proposed to obtain it by the time the task implementation starts.
If the evaluation of the award criterion is positive, the applicants are considered to have
sufficient operational capacity.
Applicants will have to show their capacity via the following information:
− general profiles (qualifications and experiences) of the staff responsible for
managing and implementing the project
− description of the consortium participants
− list of previous projects (key projects, notably previous EDIH operations, for the
last 4 years) (template available in Part B)
Additional supporting documents may be requested, if needed to confirm the
operational capacity of any applicant.

distortion of competition that cannot be remedied otherwise (conflict of
interest).
8. Evaluation and award procedure
The proposals will have to follow the standard submission and evaluation
procedure (one-stage submission + one-step evaluation).
An evaluation committee (composed or assisted by independent outside experts) will
assess all applications. Proposals will first be checked for formal requirements
(admissibility, and eligibility, see sections 5 and 6). Proposals found admissible and
eligible will be evaluated against the operational capacity and award criteria (see
sections 7 and 9) and then ranked according to their scores.
The ranking will happen in two steps:
First a candidate list per country will be established. In case there are ex aequo
proposals for the candidate list per country, proposals will be prioritised according to
the scores they have been awarded for the award criterion ‘Relevance’. When these
scores are equal, priority will be based on their scores for the criterion ‘Impact’. When
these scores are equal, priority will be based on their scores for the criterion
‘Implementation’.
Second, an optimisation process will take into account the additional criteria and
objectives for the EDIH Network set out in the Digital Europe Regulation and the budget
allocated to each country to ensure proper coverage of territories, technologies and
economic sectors, namely:
− at the level of each country:
− the existence of at least one EDIH per country with focus on artificial
intelligence (AI)
− the geographical, technological and sectorial coverage of EDIHs within each
country, with the objective to guarantee a coverage as broad as possible
− at the level of the entire European network:
− the possibility to fund cross-border transnational EDIHs by all countries
involved
− the coverage of specific technologies and sectors which are not sufficiently
covered by the entire network
− the coverage of the public sector, with the objective of reaching a coverage
of at least 10% of the hubs providing services to the public sector.
All Proposals in this topic that are eligible and exceed the evaluation thresholds will be
awarded a STEP Seal and will be listed on the STEP portal22. The STEP Seal23 is a
recognition given to projects that contribute to STEP objectives and meet the minimum
quality criteria set by this call for proposals. The Seal is a quality label and a facilitator
for accessing EU funds, making it easier for projects to receive combined or cumulative

funding from various EU budgetary instruments. For example, projects awarded the
STEP Seal can receive support from cohesion policy funds (e.g., ERDF or ESF+) by
Member States without undergoing additional selection processes24.
If Member States decide to further finance proposals that are below the budget
threshold (i.e. not ranked high enough to receive funding from Digital Europe), they
will also be able to use the label ‘European Digital Innovation Hub’ and will be full
members of the Network.
All proposals will be informed about the evaluation result (evaluation result letter).
Successful proposals will be invited for grant preparation; the other ones will be put on
the reserve list or rejected.
No commitment for funding — Invitation to grant preparation does NOT constitute
a formal commitment for funding. We will still need to make various legal checks before
grant award: legal entity validation, financial capacity, exclusion check, etc.
Grant preparation will involve a dialogue in order to fine-tune technical or financial
aspects of the project and may require extra information from your side. It may also
include adjustments to the proposal to address recommendations of the evaluation
committee or other concerns. Full compliance will be a pre-condition for signing the
grant.
If you believe that the evaluation procedure was flawed, you can submit a complaint
(following the deadlines and procedures set out in the evaluation result letter). Please
note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending will be
considered to have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from
opening/access (see also Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions). Please also
be aware that for complaints submitted electronically, there may be character
limitations.

Proposals that pass the individual thresholds AND the overall threshold will be
considered for funding — within the limits of the available budget (i.e. up to the budget
ceiling). Other proposals will be rejected.
10. Legal and financial set-up of the Grant Agreements
If you pass evaluation, your project will be invited for grant preparation, where you will
be asked to prepare the Grant Agreement together with the EU Project Officer.
This Grant Agreement will set the framework for your grant and its terms and
conditions, in particular concerning deliverables, reporting and payments.
The Model Grant Agreement that will be used (and all other relevant templates and
guidance documents) can be found on Portal Reference Documents.
Starting date
The project starting date and duration will be fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data Sheet,
point 1). Normally the starting date will be after grant signature. A retroactive starting
date can be granted exceptionally for duly justified reasons — even before proposal
submission date back to 1st May, 2025.

Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs with reinforced AI focus)]
EU Grants: Call document (DEP): V1.0 – 01.04.2025
Project duration
The projects must have a duration of 36 months.
Extensions are possible, if duly justified and through an amendment.
Milestones and deliverables
The milestones and deliverables for each project will be managed through the Portal
Grant Management System and will be reflected in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement.
The following deliverables will be mandatory for all projects:
− additional deliverable on dissemination and exploitation, to be submitted in the
first six months of the project. In exploitation, the proposal will describe how
the EDIH ensures sustainability of its operations.
− Additional deliverable on the economic sustainability of the EDIH, to be
submitted 18 months after the start.
Form of grant, funding rate and maximum grant amount
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc)
will be fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data Sheet, point 3 and art 5).
Project budget (requested grant amount):
− between EUR 1 000 000 and EUR 3 000 000 per project. The grant awarded
may be lower than the amount requested.
The grant will be a budget-based mixed actual cost grant (actual costs, with unit cost
and flat-rate elements). This means that it will reimburse ONLY certain types of costs
(eligible costs) and costs that were actually incurred for your project (NOT the budgeted
costs). For unit costs and flat-rates, you can charge the amounts calculated as
explained in the Grant Agreement (see art 6 and Annex 2 and 2a).
The costs will be reimbursed at the funding rate fixed in the Grant Agreement. This rate
depends on the type of action which applies to the topic (see section 2).
Grants may NOT produce a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU grant over costs). For-
profit organisations must declare their revenues and, if there is a profit, we will deduct
it from the final grant amount (see art 22.3).
Moreover, please be aware that the final grant amount may be reduced in case of non-
compliance with the Grant Agreement (e.g. improper implementation, breach of
obligations, etc).
Budget categories and cost eligibility rules
The budget categories and cost eligibility rules are fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data
Sheet, point 3 and art 6).

Reporting and payment arrangements
The reporting and payment arrangements are fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data
Sheet, point 4 and art 21 and 22).
After grant signature, you will normally receive a prefinancing to start working on the
project (float of normally 65% of the maximum grant amount; exceptionally less or no
prefinancing). The prefinancing will be paid 30 days from entry into force/10 days
before starting date/financial guarantee (if required) – whichever is the latest.
There will be one or more interim payments (with cost reporting through the use of
resources report).
Payment of the balance: At the end of the project, we will calculate your final grant
amount. If the total of earlier payments is higher than the final grant amount, we will
ask you (your coordinator) to pay back the difference (recovery).
All payments will be made to the coordinator.
Please be aware that payments will be automatically lowered if you or one of your
consortium members has outstanding debts towards the EU (granting authority or other
EU bodies). Such debts will be offset by us — in line with the conditions set out in the
Grant Agreement (see art 22).
Please also note that you are responsible for keeping records on all the work done
and the costs declared.
Prefinancing guarantees
If a prefinancing guarantee is required, it will be fixed in the Grant Agreement (Data
Sheet, point 4). The amount will be set during grant preparation and it will normally be
equal or lower than the prefinancing for your grant.
The guarantee should be in euro and issued by an approved bank/financial institution
established in an EU Member State. If you are established in a non-EU country and
would like to provide a guarantee from a bank/financial institution in your country,
please contact us (this may be exceptionally accepted, if it offers equivalent security).
Amounts blocked in bank accounts will NOT be accepted as financial guarantees.
Prefinancing guarantees are normally requested from the coordinator, for the
consortium. They must be provided during grant preparation, in time to make the
prefinancing (scanned copy via Portal AND original by post).
If agreed with us, the bank guarantee may be replaced by a guarantee from a third
party.
The guarantee will be released at the end of the grant, in accordance with the conditions
laid down in the Grant Agreement (art 23).

or
− individual financial responsibility — each beneficiary only for their own debts.
In addition, the granting authority may require joint and several liability of affiliated
entities (with their beneficiary).

11. How to submit an application
All proposals must be submitted directly online via the Funding & Tenders Portal
Electronic Submission System. Paper applications are NOT accepted.
Submission is a 2-step process:
a) create a user account and register your organisation
To use the Submission System (the only way to apply), all participants need to create
an EU Login user account.
Once you have an EULogin account, you can register your organisation in the Participant
Register. When your registration is finalised, you will receive a 9-digit participant
identification code (PIC).
b) submit the proposal
Access the Electronic Submission System via the Topic page in the Calls for proposals
section (or, for calls sent by invitation to submit a proposal, through the link provided
in the invitation letter).
Submit your proposal in 3 parts, as follows:
− Part A includes administrative information about the applicant organisations
(future coordinator, beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated partners)
and the summarised budget for the proposal. Fill it in directly online
− Part B (description of the action) covers the technical content of the proposal.
Download the mandatory word template from the Submission System, fill it in
and upload it as a PDF file
− Annexes (see section 5). Upload them as PDF file (single or multiple depending
on the slots). Excel upload is sometimes possible, depending on the file type.
The proposal must keep to the page limits (see section 5); excess pages will be
disregarded.
Documents must be uploaded to the right category in the Submission System,
otherwise the proposal may be considered incomplete and thus inadmissible.

Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs with reinforced AI focus)]
EU Grants: Call document (DEP): V1.0 – 01.04.2025
The proposal must be submitted before the call deadline (see section 4). After this
deadline, the system is closed and proposals can no longer be submitted.
Once the proposal is submitted, you will receive a confirmation e-mail (with date and
time of your application). If you do not receive this confirmation e-mail, it means your
proposal has NOT been submitted. If you believe this is due to a fault in the Submission
System, you should immediately file a complaint via the IT Helpdesk webform,
explaining the circumstances and attaching a copy of the proposal (and, if possible,
screenshots to show what happened).
Details on processes and procedures are described in the Online Manual. The Online
Manual also contains the links to FAQs and detailed instructions regarding the Portal
Electronic Exchange System.
12. Help

13. Important
IMPORTANT
• Don’t wait until the end — Complete your application sufficiently in advance of the
deadline to avoid any last minute technical problems. Problems due to last minute
submissions (e.g. congestion, etc) will be entirely at your risk. Call deadlines can NOT
be extended.
• Consult the Portal Topic page regularly. We will use it to publish updates and
additional information on the call (call and topic updates).
• Funding & Tenders Portal Electronic Exchange System — By submitting the
application, all participants accept to use the electronic exchange system in
accordance with the Portal Terms & Conditions.
• Registration — Before submitting the application, all beneficiaries, affiliated entities
and associated partners must be registered in the Participant Register. The
participant identification code (PIC) (one per participant) is mandatory for the
Application Form.
• Consortium roles — When setting up your consortium, you should think of
organisations that help you reach objectives and solve problems.
The roles should be attributed according to the level of participation in the project.
Main participants should participate as beneficiaries or affiliated entities; other
entities can participate as associated partners, subcontractors, third parties giving
in-kind contributions. Associated partners and third parties giving in-kind
contributions should bear their own costs (they will not become formal recipients of
EU funding). Subcontracting should normally constitute a limited part and must be
performed by third parties (not by one of the beneficiaries/affiliated entities).
Subcontracting going beyond 30% of the total eligible costs must be justified in the
application.
• Coordinator — In multi-beneficiary grants, the beneficiaries participate as
consortium (group of beneficiaries). They will have to choose a coordinator, who will
take care of the project management and coordination and will represent the
consortium towards the granting authority. In mono-beneficiary grants, the single
beneficiary will automatically be coordinator.
• Affiliated entities — Applicants may participate with affiliated entities (i.e. entities
linked to a beneficiary which participate in the action with similar rights and
obligations as the beneficiaries, but do not sign the grant and therefore do not
become beneficiaries themselves). They will get a part of the grant money and must
therefore comply with all the call conditions and be validated (just like beneficiaries);
but they do not count towards the minimum eligibility criteria for consortium
composition (if any). If affiliated entities participate in your project, please do not
forget to provide documents demonstrating their affiliation link to your organisation
as part of your application.
• Associated partners — Applicants may participate with associated partners (i.e.
partner organisations which participate in the action but without the right to get grant
money). They participate without funding and therefore do not need to be validated.
• Consortium agreement — For practical and legal reasons it is recommended to set
up internal arrangements that allow you to deal with exceptional or unforeseen
circumstances (in all cases, even if not mandatory under the Grant Agreement). The
consortium agreement also gives you the possibility to redistribute the grant money
according to your own consortium-internal principles and parameters (for instance,
one beneficiary can reattribute its grant money to another beneficiary). The
consortium agreement thus allows you to customise the EU grant to the needs inside
your consortium and can also help to protect you in case of disputes.
32Call: [DIGITAL-2025-EDIH-CONSOLIDATION-EU-EEA-08-STEP — Consolidation of the Network of European
Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs with reinforced AI focus)]
EU Grants: Call document (DEP): V1.0 – 01.04.2025
• Balanced project budget — Grant applications must ensure a balanced project
budget and sufficient other resources to implement the project successfully (e.g. own
contributions, income generated by the action, financial contributions from third
parties, etc). You may be requested to lower your estimated costs, if they are
ineligible (including excessive).
• Completed/ongoing projects — Proposals for projects that have already been
completed will be rejected; proposals for projects that have already started will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis (in this case, no costs can be reimbursed for
activities that took place before the project starting date/proposal submission).
• No-profit rule — Grants may NOT give a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU grant
over costs). This will be checked by us at the end of the project.
• No cumulation of funding/no double funding — It is strictly prohibited to
cumulate funding from the EU budget (except under ‘EU Synergies actions’). Outside
such Synergies actions, any given action may receive only ONE grant from the EU
budget and cost items may under NO circumstances be declared under two EU
grants; projects must be designed as different actions, clearly delineated and
separated for each grant (without overlaps).
• Combination with EU operating grants — Combination with EU operating grants
is possible, if the project remains outside the operating grant work programme and
you make sure that cost items are clearly separated in your accounting and NOT
declared twice (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 6.2.E).
• Multiple proposals — Applicants may submit more than one proposal for different
projects under the same call (and be awarded funding for them).
Organisations may participate in several proposals.
BUT: if there are several proposals for very similar projects, only one application will
be accepted and evaluated; the applicants will be asked to withdraw the others (or
they will be rejected).
• Resubmission — Proposals may be changed and re-submitted until the deadline for
submission.
• Rejection — By submitting the application, all applicants accept the call conditions
set out in this this Call document (and the documents it refers to). Proposals that do
not comply with all the call conditions will be rejected. This applies also to applicants:
All applicants need to fulfil the criteria; if any one of them doesn’t, they must be
replaced or the entire proposal will be rejected.
• Cancellation — There may be circumstances which may require the cancellation of
the call. In this case, you will be informed via a call or topic update. Please note that
cancellations are without entitlement to compensation.
• Language — You can submit your proposal in any official EU language (project
abstract/summary should however always be in English). For reasons of efficiency,
we strongly advise you to use English for the entire application. If you need the call
documentation in another official EU language, please submit a request within 10
days after call publication (for the contact information, see section 12).

The Digital Europe Programme uses the following actions to implement grants:
Simple Grants
Description: Simple Grants (SIMPLE) are a flexible type of action used by a large
variety of topics and can cover most activities. The consortium will mostly use personnel
costs to implement action tasks, activities with third parties (subcontracting, financial
support, purchase) are possible but should be limited.
Funding rate: 50%
Payment model: Prefinancing – (x) interim payment(s) – final payment

Annex 2
Eligibility restrictions under Articles 12(5) and (6) and 18(4) of the Digital
Europe Regulation
Security restrictions Article 12(5) and (6)
If indicated in the Digital Europe Work Programme, and if justified for security reasons,
topics can exclude the participation of legal entities established in a third country or
DEP associated country, or established in the EU territory but controlled by a third
country or third country legal entities (including DEP associated countries)29.
This restriction is applicable for SO1 (High Performance Computing), SO2 (Artificial
Intelligence) and SO3 (Cybersecurity), but at different levels.
− In the case of SO3, the provision is implemented in the strictest way. When
activated, only entities established in the EU AND controlled from the EU will be
able to participate; entities from associated countries (which are normally
eligible) can NOT participate — unless otherwise provided in the Work
Programme.
− In SO1 and SO2, entities established in associated countries and entities
controlled from non-EU countries may participate, if they comply with the
conditions set out in the Work Programme (usually:
− for the associated countries: be formally associated to Digital Europe
Programme and receive a positive assessment by the Commission on the
replies to their associated country security questionnaire.
− for the participants: submission of a guarantee demonstrating that they
have taken measures to ensure that their participation does not
contravene security or EU strategic autonomy interests).
EEA countries (and participants from EEA countries) are exempted from these
restrictions (and additional requirements) because EEA countries benefit from a
status equivalent to the Member States.
In order to determine the ownership and control status, participants30 will be required
to fill in and submit an ownership control declaration*as part of the proposal (and later
on be requested to submit supporting documents) (see Guidance on participation in
DEP, HE, EDF and CEF-DIG restricted calls).
In addition, where a guarantee is required, the participants will also have to fill in the
guarantee template*, approved by the competent authorities of their country of
establishment, and submit it to the granting authority which will assess its validity.
The activation of these restrictions will also make a number of specific provisions in the
Grant Agreement applicable, such as country restrictions for eligible costs, country
restrictions for subcontracting, and special rules for implementation, exploitation of
results and transfers and exclusive licensing of results.
Thus:
29 See Article 12(5) and (6) of the Digital Europe Regulation 2021/694.

− participation in any capacity (as beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner,
subcontractor or recipient of financial support to third parties) is also limited to
entities established in and controlled from eligible countries
− project activities (included subcontracted work) must take place in eligible
countries
− the Grant Agreement provides for specific IPR restrictions.

If indicated in the Digital Europe Work Programme, calls can limit the participation to
entities established in the EU, and/or entities established in third countries associated
to the programme for EU strategic autonomy reasons31.
The activation of these restrictions will make a number of specific provisions in the
Grant Agreement applicable, such as country restrictions for eligible costs, country

Classification of information in Digital Europe
projects
Version 1.0
01 November 2021EU grants: Classification of information in Digital Europe projects: V1.0 – 01.11.2021
IMPORTANT NOTICE
This document aims at providing guidance on when and how security-sensitive information
produced by Digital Europe Programme projects should be classified. The specific objectives
of this document are to:
 inform applicants on when and how information may be designated by an EU
classification marking and at which level and help them to draft a comprehensive
security self-assessment and security section
 help the granting authority staff to identify potential security sensitive topics in the
calls for proposals, as well as to identify potential security issues in ongoing funded
projects
 assist the national security experts of the Security Scrutiny Group with conducting
the Security Scrutiny of proposals that have been selected for funding.
This guidance concerns solely protective measures to be taken to preserve the
confidentiality of security-sensitive information in Digital Europe Programme projects.
Other aspects (e.g. data protection, ethical issues, dual-use, etc.) are covered in other
parts of the evaluation procedure.
Projects with classified information must comply with Decision 2015/444 and the
Implementing rules on classified grants.
Under the new security rules, all classification markings must now be written in FR/EN
format (e.g. RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED).

4EU grants: Classification of information in Digital Europe projects: V1.0 – 01.11.2021
1. When and for how long must information be classified?
Under Decision 2015/4441 and the Implementing rules on classified grants2, information
must be classified as EU classified information (EUCI) if its unauthorised disclosure
could adversely impact the interests of the EU or of one (or more) of its Member
States.
There are two types of classified information:
Classified background information — is information already classified by the EU
entities, nation states or international organisations, which is used in the frame of a
project.
Classified foreground information — is information produced by a project, which is
classified as EU Classified Information (EUCI).
Example: some of the information produced by a project could potentially be used to plan
terrorist attacks or avoid detection of criminal activities
To minimise costs and restrictions caused by classifying project information, the
classification will be for a limited time — after which classification will be reviewed and
possibly downgraded, declassified or extended.
Classification of information may be combined with other security
recommendations (REC) (e.g. limited dissemination, creation of a security advisory
group, limiting the level of detail, using a fake scenario, excluding the use of classified
information, etc.).
2. Classification levels
There are four levels of classification:
 TRÈS SECRET UE/EU TOP-SECRET (TS-UE/EU-TS)
TRÈS SECRET UE/EU TOP-SECRET — projects involving information classified
TRÈS SECRET UE/EU TOP SECRET cannot be funded under the Digital Europe
Programme.
 SECRET UE/EU SECRET (S-UE/EU-S)
Use this classification for information which could seriously harm essential EU or
national interests.
Example: threatening of life or the serious prejudicing of public order or individual security
and liberty
 CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL (C-UE/EU-C)
Use this for information which could harm essential EU or national interests.
Example: inception of damage to the operational effectiveness or security of a Member
State or other State’s forces or to the effectiveness of valuable security or intelligence
operations
 RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED (R-UE/EU-R)
1 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p.53.)
2 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2021/259 of 10 February 2021 laying down implementing rules on
industrial security with regard to classified grants (OJ L 58, 19.2.2021, p. 55)
5EU grants: Classification of information in Digital Europe projects: V1.0 – 01.11.2021
Use this for information which could be disadvantageous to those interests.
Example: information which could potentially make it more difficult to maintain the
operational effectiveness or security of Member States or other State’s forces
3. How to classify information
The classification of information produced by digital projects will normally depend on two
parameters:
 the subject-matter of the project, such as:
 cybersecurity
 quantum technologies
AND
 the type of the results and whether it is being done in simulated environments
(e.g. serious gaming, etc.) or (nearly) operational environments, such as:
 threat assessments (i.e. estimation of the likelihood of a malicious act
against an asset, with particular reference to factors such as intention,
capacity and potential impact)
 vulnerability assessments (i.e. description of gaps or weaknesses in
networks, services, systems, assets, operations or processes which can be
exploited during malicious acts, and often contain suggestions to eliminate or
diminish these weaknesses)
 specifications (i.e. exact guidelines on the design, composition, manufacture,
maintenance or operation of threat substances or countermeasure substances,
technologies and procedures)
 capability assessments (i.e. description of the ability of an asset, system,
network, service or authority to fulfil its intended role — and in particular the
capacity of units, installations, systems, technologies, substances and
personnel that have security-related functions to carry these out successfully)
 incidents/scenarios (i.e. detailed information on real-life security incidents
and potential threat scenarios):
 on past incidents (often including details not otherwise publicly
available, demonstrating the real-life effects of particular attack
methods or security gaps which have since been addressed)
 on devised scenarios (commonly derived directly from existing
vulnerabilities, but normally with a lower level of detail, particularly of
the attack preparation phase)).
These categories are not exhaustive, and may overlap.
3.1 Cybersecurity projects
What?
'Cybersecurity' covers a wide range of topics linked to security aspects of the internet
and of digital systems, infrastructures, processes and services, such as relevant tools and
technologies (e.g. cryptographic techniques, artificial intelligence systems, situational
awareness tools) and other relevant technological and procedural measures used to
ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of the concerned information.
6EU grants: Classification of information in Digital Europe projects: V1.0 – 01.11.2021
Digital systems and infrastructures might include some sensitive information, in
particular concerning the security measures used to protect them. In some cybersecurity
projects, EU classification might not be required to handle such sensitive information. In
other projects, a suitable level of EU classification might be required in view of either the
specific domain/sector addressed, or the content/type of the envisaged deliverables or
whether the outcomes will be validated in (nearly) operational environments.
The need for EU classification in cybersecurity proposed projects will be examined for
each proposal on a case-by-case basis.
How to deal with threat assessments?
Threat assessments prepared by cybersecurity projects may include some sensitive
sections and even classified ones.
How to deal with vulnerability assessments?
Particular attention should be paid in the area of vulnerability assessments. For example:
The proposed cybersecurity projects may come upon previously unknown vulnerabilities
(‘zero-day vulnerabilities’); in this case, responsible disclosure is required and EU
classification might be needed.
How to deal with specifications?
In some cases, the specifications prepared during a cybersecurity project might need to
be classified. For example, a project for the procurement/establishment of a critical
digital infrastructure aiming to improve cybersecurity, where one of the first steps would
be the elaboration of technical specifications for such infrastructure.
How to deal with capability assessments?
Classification might be needed e.g when the proposed project plans to handle highly
sensitive information/data.
How to deal with incidents/scenarios?
Classification might be necessary for some use-case risk assessments. Depending on the
type of use-case and the context of the project, the results of information security risk
assessments (especially if obtained in operational or near operational environments) may
include certain threats and/or vulnerabilities that require classification. For example, in
case of critical infrastructures, the operational risks assessment may need to be
classified.
3.2 Quantum technologies projects
What?
Quantum Technologies are structured around four distinct but interconnected
application domains (Communication, Computing, Simulation as well as Sensing &
Metrology), which are complemented by a Scientific and Technological Resources area,
which encompasses basic science and cross-cutting activities — engineering, control,
software and theory.
A specific deployment initiative is EuroQCI, which is part of the quantum communication
domain. The EuroQCI will link critical public communication assets all over the EU, and
would make it possible for sensitive information to be transmitted and stored much more
securely — using quantum key distribution. It would help to protect the EU’s key digital
assets, secure financial transactions, shield national and cross-border critical information
infrastructure against eavesdropping.
7EU grants: Classification of information in Digital Europe projects: V1.0 – 01.11.2021
We assume that in most cases Quantum Technologies proposal do not need any
classification. However, in some specific cases, projects in particular under the EuroQCI
initiative may need to be classified. In this case, the EU classification levels may need to
be determined according to the specific subject- matter, the type of the results and
whether the projects outcomes are delivered in simulated environments or in (nearly)
operational environments.
The need for classification of Quantum Technology projects will be examined for each
proposal on a case-by-case basis.
How to deal with threat assessments?
Threat assessments prepared by quantum communication projects may include some
sensitive sections even to the level of need for classification.
How to deal with vulnerability assessments?
Particular attention should be paid in the area of vulnerability assessments. Projects may
come upon previously unknown vulnerabilities; in this case, responsible disclosure is
required and classification might be needed in accordance with the rules and
classification levels foreseen for the specific subject-matter.
How to deal with specifications?
The need for classification of Quantum Technology projects specifications will be
examined for each proposal on a case-by-case basis. The classification levels will be
selected by the EuroQCI security group in accordance with applicable national,
international and EU legislation. Specification data includes:
 Detailed information on the design, characteristics, operation and requirements
of, and prototypes for, key functional devices for use in EuroQCI.
 Systems information (such as the functional or technical architecture, platforms,
software and algorithms).
 Detailed information on operational processes, including information on
communication and interoperability (such as frequencies used, data rates and
communication protocols).
Regarding the EuroQCI infrastructure, information should be classified at the same level
whether terrestrial or space segments are concerned. Coherence between the level of
classified information produced by ESA and by the EU should therefore be ensured.
How to deal with capability assessments?
Classification might be needed e.g when the proposed project plans to handle highly
sensitive information/data. How to deal with incidents/scenarios?
Classification might be necessary for use-case risk assessments. Depending on the type
of use-case and the context of the project, the results of information security risk
assessments (especially if obtained in operational or near operational environments) may
include certain threats and/or vulnerabilities that require classification.

0EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
IMPORTANT NOTICE
This guidance is designed to help applicants and beneficiaries of EU projects make your
proposal ethics-compliant.
It has been prepared mainly for 3 EU Programmes: Horizon Europe (HE), Digital Europe
(DEP) and European Defence Fund (EDF). But it can also be used for other programmes that
may require an ethics review to authorise funding (AMIF, ISF, EMFAF, EU4H, etc).
The guidance will help you identify and deal with ethics issues that may arise from your
project and provide help with filling out your application.
This document is however no more than a ‘how to’ guide. It covers most of the ethics
issues that usually arise in EU projects and gives advice on dealing with classic cases.
What do you need to provide? If your proposal raises one or more of the issues listed in
the ethics issues table, you must also complete the ethics self-assessment. This must
include a description of the issue, the way you intend to deal with them in order to ensure
ethics compliance and any relevant documents (such as authorisation or permissions that
are already available with their expiry date). In case such documents are not yet available,
please provide the expected timing. This will allow for a more effective ethics clearance and
an accelerated granting process if the proposal is retained for possible funding.
The ethics self-assessment will become part of your Grant Agreement (in Annex 1, as
description of the action, ethics requirements, etc.) and may thus give rise to binding
obligations that may later on be checked through ethics checks, reviews or audits.
This means the time you invest in this self-assessment is not wasted. It will actually
improve your project and:
 ensure compliance with applicable international, EU and national law
 allow your proposal to be processed more easily during the selection procedure
 contribute to the responsible implementation of your project, thereby increasing its
social acceptance
 allow the results of your project to be published more easily in internationally refereed
journals (especially important for research projects).
Consider that ethics issues arise in many areas. For Horizon Europe projects, apart from the
obvious example, the medical field, research protocols in social sciences, ethnography,
psychology, environmental studies, security research, etc. may involve the voluntary
participation of research subjects and the collection of data that might be considered as
personal. For Digital Europe and EDF, the collection of personal data and the deployment
and application of AI in any form are the obvious candidates. However, issues may arise in
other fields as well. You must protect the addressees of your project, yourself and your
colleagues.
Start thinking about ethics while designing your proposal. Do not wait until the last minute
to seek advice or check requirements under national and EU law. Use the ethics by design
methodology for highly innovative activities (e.g. see section 8 for implementation in
artificial intelligence context).
1EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
Your first source should always be at your institution. We would ask you to seek
advice from colleagues with ethics expertise, such as:
 specialised ethics and compliance departments
 relevant compliance managers
 hospital ethics committees
 ethics advisors in your company
 data protection officers.
They will be able to provide you with information appropriate to your specific needs and
legal environment.
For projects with a significant ethics dimension, consider involving/appointing
an ethics advisor/advisory board. From the beginning of your project, an ethics
advisor can help you deal with ethical issues and put in place the procedures to handle
them appropriately. If your activities includes several ethical concerns or involves several
significant or complex ethical issues (such as the processing of special categories of
personal data (formerly known as ‘sensitive data’), AI applications involving human-
machine cooperation, participation of children from developing countries, non-human
primates (NHPs), potential misuse or vulnerable populations), we suggest you appoint an
ethics advisor or an ethics advisory board comprising several experts from different
backgrounds. The granting authority may also make this an ethics requirement during the
selection procedure. For more information, see also Guidelines on serious and complex
ethics issues (for EDF, exclusive focus on civil applications not applicable)).

1. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human embryos (hEs) (HE, DEP,
EU4H and EDF)
1.1 Background
This section covers projects with activities involving human embryonic stem cells
(hESCs) and human embryos (hEs).
For activities involving human embryonic or foetal tissues or cells other than hESCs,
see Section 3.
The following activities are not eligible for EU funding and cannot therefore be
included in proposals:
 activities directed at human cloning for reproductive purposes
 activities intended to modify the genetic make-up of human beings that could
make such changes heritable (apart from research relating to cancer treatment
of the gonads, which may be financed)
 activities intended to create human embryos solely for the purposes of
research or stem cell procurement, including the technique of somatic cell
nuclear transfer1
 activities that lead to the destruction of human embryos2
Activities involving human stem cells, both adult and embryonic, may be
financed, depending both on the contents of the scientific proposal and the legal
framework of the Member States involved.
No funding will be granted for activities within or outside the EU that are prohibited in
all the Member States. No activity will be funded in a Member State where such
activity is forbidden.3
Please note that all proposals involving the use of hESCs or hEs will undergo
an ethics assessment and, for some programmes, also special approval procedures
(for Horizon and EDF, approval by the Programme Committee4).
1.2 How to address the issues
Your research activities must comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant
Agreement, and notably:
 highest ethical standards
 applicable international, EU and national law (in particular, the Statement by
the Commission on research activities involving human embryos or human
embryonic stem cells5).
1 See Article 18(1) HE Framework Programme Regulation 2021/695.
2 For research activities, see Joint Declarations of the European Parliament, Council and Commission
(Framework Programme) (2021/C 185/01).
3 See also Article 18(2) HE Framework Programme Regulation 2021/695.
4 See Article 11(4) HE Specific Programme Decision 2021/764; Article 11(2) EDF Programme Regulation.
4EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
For research activities involving human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), this means
you must make sure that:
 cells were NOT derived from embryos specially created for research or by
somatic cell nuclear transfer
 the project uses existing cultured cell lines only
 cell lines were derived from supernumerary non-implanted embryos resulting
from in vitro fertilisation
 informed consent has been obtained for using donated embryos for the
derivation of the cell lines
 personal data and privacy of donors of embryos for the derivation of the cells
are protected according to the data protection rules applicable for the donors
and in the EU
 NO financial inducements were provided for the donation of embryos used for
derivation of the cell lines.
You must provide the granting authority with a declaration confirming compliance
with these conditions (as part of your proposal).
Furthermore:
 each project proposing to use hESC must successfully pass a scientific
evaluation during which the necessity of using hESC to achieve the scientific
objectives are assessed by independent scientific experts
 each project proposing to use hESC must obtain the approval of the relevant
national or local ethics committee prior to the start of the relevant activities
within the project
 full compliance with the licensing and control measures for research on hESC
as laid down in the relevant applicable national laws and regulations must be
confirmed in the application.6
For research involving human embryos (hE), you must obtain the donors’ free and
fully informed consent.
In addition, in your application you must confirm that your activity will NOT:
 create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of
stem cell procurement (including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer)
 result in the destruction of human embryos
5 See Joint Declarations of the European Parliament, Council and Commission (Framework
Programme)(2021/C 185/01) – applies mutatis mutandis also for EDF.
6 See also Article 19(2)(d) HE Framework Programme Regulation 2021/695.

2. Humans (all EU Programmes)
2.1 Background
This section refers to projects with activities involving work with human beings that
are not part of the staff of the participants (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated
partners, subcontractors, etc). It thus covers research or study participants, persons
concerned by the project activities, etc., regardless of its nature or topic.
Examples:
For Horizon Europe: collection of biological samples, personal data, medical interventions,
interviews, observations, tracking or the secondary use of information provided for other
purposes, e.g. other projects, officially collected information, social media sites, etc.
For EDF: clinical trials, intrusive exoskeletons, neuroscience, mind-controlled machinery,
brain-to-brain communication, neuro-morphic engineering, human enhancement devices,
mind/brain control of systems or weapons, collection of biological samples, personal data,
medical interventions, interviews, observations, tracking or secondary use of information
provided for other purposes (e.g. other projects), officially collected information, social
media sites, etc
Common to all fields, the main ethics issues concern:
 the respect for persons and for human dignity
 fair distribution of benefits and burden
 the rights and interests of the participants
 the need to ensure participants' free informed consent (with particular
attention to vulnerable categories of individuals such as children, patients,
discriminated people, minorities, persons unable to give consent, etc.).
Moreover, the methodologies you are using should not result in discriminatory
practices or unfair treatment.
2.2 How to address the issues
Your activities must comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement,
and notably:
 highest ethical standards
 applicable international, EU and national law.
Moreover, you must obtain:
 the necessary ethics approvals (if required)
 free and fully informed consent of the participants.
Participation must be entirely voluntary and you must obtain and clearly document
participants’ informed consent in advance.
Exception: No consent is required if national law provides for an exception (e.g.
in the public interest).
Participants must be given a project-specific informed consent form and detailed
information sheets that:
 are written in a language and in terms they can fully understand
8EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
 describe the aims, methods and implications of the project activity, the
nature of the participation and any benefits, risks or discomfort that might
ensue
 explicitly state that participation is voluntary and that anyone has the right
to refuse to participate and to withdraw their participation, samples or data
at any time — without any consequences
 state how biological samples and data will be collected, protected during
the project and whether they will be destroyed or reused afterwards
 state what procedures will be implemented in the event of unexpected or
incidental findings (in particular, how and when participants will be
informed about such finding, whether they have the right “not to know”
about any such findings, and whether relevant findings (e.g. genetic
information) might affect relatives as well).
You must ensure that potential participants have fully understood the information and
do not feel pressured or coerced into giving consent.
Participants must normally give their consent in writing (e.g. by signing the informed
consent form and information sheets).
If consent cannot be given in writing, for example because of illiteracy, non-written
consent must be formally documented and independently witnessed.
Informed consent
Activities involving children (or other persons unable to give consent) — For
children (or other persons unable to give informed consent, e.g. certain elderly
populations, persons judged as lacking mental capacity), the consent must be obtained
from the parents/legally authorised representative and it must be ensured that they have
sufficient information to enable them to provide this on behalf and in the best interests of
the children. Whenever possible, the assent of the participants should be obtained in
addition to the consent of the parents/legal representatives. Dissent should be respected.
If standard procedures for obtaining written informed consent are harmful or offensive to
the participants (rather than affording them protection), explain how alternative consent
will be gained (e.g. orally). If deception is to be used, retrospective informed consent
should be obtained and participants must be debriefed. Deception requires strong
justification and appropriate assessment of the impact and the risk incurred by both
researchers and participants.
Medical activities or other activities involving humans requiring informed consent
— For medical activities or other activities involving humans requiring informed consent,
you must follow the procedures for informed consent that are described in the Declaration
of Helsinki and the Oviedo Bioethics Convention (see below).
What do you need to provide?
Informed Consent Forms + Information Sheets
At the time of submission of your proposal, it is enough to provide templates of the
different types of forms and information sheets you will use (one example per type) but
still they must be specific to your project. The final forms must be kept on file and may
have to be submitted later on, if requested by the granting authority.
Where your project involves studies using particular methodological tools (e.g.
surveys, questionnaires, interviews, standardised tests, direct observation,
ethnography, recordings, experiments with volunteers, and sometimes physical
interventions), you must clarify the ethical implications of the chosen methodologies.
9EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
General principle — maximise benefits and minimise risks/harm. The
methodologies used must not result in discriminatory practices or unfair treatment.
In your proposal, you should provide an assessment of risks, stating explicitly what
kinds of harm (psychological, social, legal, economic, environmental, etc.) might
occur, the likelihood of subjects actually incurring such harm, and the steps that you
will take to minimise them.
Example: Describe the sampling methods or recruitment procedures and discuss whether
they could result in discriminatory practices. If such practices are inevitable given the
methodology, explain in your proposals the actions that will be taken to mitigate such risks
or outcomes.
In addition, when conducting surveys, interviews or focus groups where personal
information is gathered and stored, you must also pay attention to:
 privacy
 data protection
 data management (see also section 4)
 the health and safety of participants (see section 7.2).
Ensure that any personal data are kept securely and that publication of aggregate
or anonymized data (including publication on the internet) does not lead (either
directly or indirectly) to a breach of agreed confidentiality and anonymity.
In rare cases, there may be a need to override agreements on confidentiality and
anonymity (e.g. if maintaining confidentiality facilitates illegal behaviour such as drug
dealing, child abuse, etc. that has come to light in the course of the research/study).
In such circumstances, you must carefully consider disclosure to the appropriate
authorities. You must inform the participants or their guardians of your intentions and
the reasons for disclosure, unless this makes disclosure impracticable. You should also
consider the technical aspects of collecting and storing the data.
Data collection using electronic encoding tools (digital recorders or cameras) should
be given special attention (see also section 4). You should also discuss these issues
with your organisation’s data protection officer.
With regard to medical studies, the Declaration of Helsinki sets the ethics
framework for medical research (e.g. protection of life, health, dignity, integrity, right
to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research
subjects, protocols' design, role of research ethics committees, informed consent
procedures, etc.). Your grant proposal must also comply with the relevant legislation
including:
 the principles enshrined in the Oviedo Bioethics Convention (Oviedo); its main
purpose is to protect individuals against exploitation arising out of treatment
or research and it contains several detailed provisions on informed consent
 EU Regulation 536/2014 of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use
 EU Regulation 745/2017 on medical devices
 EU Regulation 746/2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices.
10EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
Specific cases
Activities involving children (or other persons unable to give consent) — should be
carried out only if:
 studies with consenting adults would not be effective
 participants are subject to only a minimal risk and burden
 results of the research will benefit the individual or group represented by the
participant.
Activities entailing more than minimal risk — typically involves:
 potentially vulnerable groups and people unable to give informed consent
 personal or sensitive topics, which might induce psychological stress, anxiety or
humiliation
 deception
 risks to researcher safety or
 seeking respondents through the internet/social media (e.g. using identifiable visual
images or discussing sensitive issues ).
Particular attention must be paid to vulnerable categories of individuals, such as children,
patients, people subject to discrimination, minorities, people unable to give consent, people of
dissenting opinion, immigrant or minority communities, sex workers, etc.
If your project activity involves children or other individuals unable to make decisions for
themselves, you must maintain an active relationship with their legal guardians and/or carers;
you must not only seek their consent, but also allow them to monitor the activity.

3. Human cells or tissues (all EU Programmes)
3.1 Background
This section refers to projects with activities using, producing or collecting human
cells or tissues (including human foetal or embryonic tissues or cells, other than
hESC).
You may obtain cells or tissues:
 from commercial sources
 as part of this project
 from another project, laboratory or institution
 from a biobank.
3.2 How to address the issues
Your activities must comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement,
and notably:
 highest ethical standards
 applicable international, EU and national law (in particular, EU Directive
2004/23 on standards for the donation, procurement, testing, processing,
preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells).
Under this Directive, the handling of cells and tissues is subject to specific
rules (in particular, concerning donor selection/protection;
accreditation/designation/authorisation/ licensing of tissue establishments and
tissue and cell preparation processes; quality management of cells and
tissues; procurement, processing, labelling, packaging, distribution,
traceability, and imports and exports of cells and tissues from and to third
countries).
The main obligations are to:
 keep track of the origin of the cells and tissues you use, produce or collect
and to obtain:
 the necessary accreditation/designation/authorisation/licensing for using,
producing or collecting the cells or tissues
 free and fully informed consent of the donors.
15EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
Informed consent
Cells or tissues from clinical practice (secondary use) — For human cells or tissues
which you or others have derived from clinical practice (e.g. waste material from surgery or
other operations) provide evidence (e.g. copies of examples of informed consent
documentation) that the donors have given informed consent for the use of their waste cells
or tissues (either specifically for the research or generally, for any secondary use).
If, for the purposes of your project activity, you intend to collect more additional
material than would normally be collected during the standard clinical procedure (e.g. a
larger than normal tissue sample or a sample that includes some additional adjacent
material), you must ensure that informed consent has also been given for collecting
additional material. You must also explain the need for such material in your grant proposal
and show that you have obtained appropriate ethics approvals.
16EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
Secondary use for future activities — If you intend to store the material for future use
in other projects, you must:
 confirm that you have obtained the donor’s consent for such secondary use
 state the legislation under which the material will be stored
 state how long it will be stored and what you will do with it at the end of the
activity.
Biobanking — Biobanks raise significant ethical issues concerning informed consent,
privacy and data protection.
‘Biobanks’ are repositories for the storage of biological samples (usually human) and
play a significant role in biomedical research. These ‘libraries’ provide researchers with
access to large numbers of tissue samples, genetic material and associated data.
If your project has the aim or results in the setting up a biobank, you must ensure that
there is strict compliance with appropriate European and national ethical standards (in
particular, regarding privacy and data protection; see section 4).
You must confirm that informed consent has been obtained and show that you have
obtained all necessary ethics approvals (or that you are exempted under national law).
No samples or associated data may be placed in the biobank before all
appropriate consents and ethics approvals have been obtained
You will need to make a report on key aspects of the biobank’s activities, including in
particular:
 information on which donors will be excluded/included (e.g. competent adults,
children and minors, adults unable to provide informed consent, individuals in
an emergency setting, etc.)
 details of the material that will be ‘banked’, including:
 personal (coded or fully identifiable) biosamples
 personal information associated with a sample (e.g. name/code, gender,
age, etc.)
 personal data resulting from analysis of a sample (e.g. analysis of genetic
material or a genome)
 anonymised biosamples
 anonymised data resulting from analysis of a sample (from which
individuals could be identified) and
 epidemiological (population level) data
 information on the standard procedures for:
 accepting material into the biobank
 processes and standards for sample-quality assurance and ensuring
accuracy of data and information
 handling requests for release of samples/data from the biobank (including
fair and just financial arrangements and benefit-sharing for third countries).
Genetic testing — For using or storing human cells or tissues for genetic testing, you must
obtain the donor's informed consent for the genetic testing, and show that you have
obtained approval from the relevant ethics and data protection bodies; and any licence
required under national legislation.
Transfer to/from non-EU countries — If your project involves the transfer of cells and
tissues from/to non-EU countries, you must comply with the specific provisions on
import/export under Directive 2004/23/EC (see also section 6).
Moreover, since human cells and tissues constitute personal data, you must also comply
with the rules on data transfer to/from non-EU countries (see section 4).

4. Personal data (all EU Programmes)
4.1 Background
This section concerns projects with research activities that involve processing of
personal data, regardless of the method used (e.g. interviews, surveys,
questionnaires, direct online retrieval etc.).
Personal data — Information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
person (Article 2(a) EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR)).
Examples: name, address, identification number, pseudonym, occupation, e-mail, CV,
location data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, cookie ID, phone number, data provided by
smart meters, data held by a hospital or doctor.
Individuals are not considered ‘identifiable’ if identifying them requires excessive
effort.
Completely anonymised data do not fall under the data protection rules (as from the
moment it has been completely anonymised, the GDPR is not applicable).
Special categories of personal data (formerly known as ‘sensitive data’) — Include
personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data,
biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data
concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation
(Article 9(1) GDPR).
The processing of such data is subject to more stringent data-protection
safeguards. Member states may introduce special derogations/limitations with regard
to the processing of genetic, data, biometric data and data concerning health.
Personal data related to criminal convictions and offences — Can be only
processed under the control of official authorities or when the processing is authorised
by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and
freedoms of data subjects (Article 10 GDPR).
The processing of personal data by state authorities for law enforcement purposes is
governed by EU Directive 2016/680.
Processing of personal data — Any operation (or set of operations) performed on
personal data, either manually or by automatic means. This includes:
 collection (digital audio recording, digital video caption, etc.)
 recording
 organisation, structuring and storage (cloud, LAN or WAN servers)
 adaptation or alteration (merging sets, appification, etc.)
 retrieval and consultation
 use
20EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
 disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available
(share, exchange, transfer)
 alignment or combination
 restriction, erasure or destruction.
Examples: access to/consultation of a database containing personal data; managing of
the database; posting/putting a photo of a person on a website; storing IP addresses
or MAC addresses; video recording (CCTV); creating a mailing list or a list of
participants.
In research, data processing normally covers any project that uses data for research
purposes (even if interviewees, human volunteers, patients, etc. are not actively
included in the research).
Personal data may come from any type of research activity (ICT, genetic sample
collection, tissue storage, personal records (financial, criminal, education, etc.),
lifestyle and health information, family histories, physical characteristics, gender and
ethnic background, location tracking and domicile information, etc.).
4.2 How to address the issues
Your research activities must comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant
Agreement, and notably:
 highest ethical standards
 applicable international, EU and national law (in particular, the GDPR, national
data protection laws and other relevant legislation).
Under these rules, personal data must be processed in accordance with certain
principles and conditions that aim to limit the negative impact on the persons
concerned and ensure fairness, transparency and accountability of the data
processing, data quality and confidentiality.
This implies the following main obligations:
 data processing should be subject to appropriate safeguards (see table above)
 data should wherever possible be processed in anonymised or pseudonymised
form
 data processing is subject to free and fully informed consent of the persons
concerned (unless already covered by another legal basis, e.g. legitimate or
public interest)
 data processing must NOT be performed in secret and participants/data
subjects must be made aware that they take part in the project and be
informed of their rights and the potential risks that the data processing may
bring
Information about the data processing operations and the contact details of
the data protection officer (project DPO or partner DPO, whichever relevant)
must be provided to the participants (art 13/art 14 GDPR).
 data may be processed ONLY if it is really adequate, relevant and limited to
what is necessary for the project (‘data minimisation principle’)
21EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
Collecting personal data (e.g. on religion, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity,
etc.) that is not essential to your project may expose you to allegations of
hidden objectives or mission creep (i.e. collecting information with permission
for one purpose and using it/making it available — online or otherwise — for
another reason, without additional permission).
 data processing operations which are more intrusive and likely to raise higher
ethics risks must be subject to higher safeguards
 for complex, sensitive or large-scale data processing or data transfers outside
of the EU, you should consult your data protection officer (DPO), if you have
one, or a suitably qualified expert
 the level of data security must be appropriate to the risks for the
participants/data subjects in case of unauthorized access or disclosure,
accidental deletion or destruction of the data
 you are responsible for all your partners, contractors or service providers that
process data at your request or on your behalf.
Generally, one of the best ways how to avoid/limit data protection issues for your
project is to use anonymised or pseudonymised data.
Pseudonymisation and anonymisation are not the same thing.
‘Anonymised’ means that the data has been rendered anonymous in such a
way that the data subject can no longer be identified (and therefore is no
longer personal data and thus outside the scope of data protection law).
‘Pseudonymised’ means to divide the data from its direct identifiers so that
linkage to a person is only possible with additional information that is held
separately. The additional information must be kept separately and securely
from processed data to ensure non-attribution.
Moreover, if you have a data protection officer (DPO), it is generally recommended
to involve them in all stages of your project, whenever it comes to privacy and data
protection issues, since this will help your proposal and grant implementation (EU
grants are subject to full compliance with privacy and data protection rules).
Be aware that even if you solve all privacy-related issues, data may still raise
other ethics issues, such as potential misuse of methodology/findings or ethics harms
to specific groups.

5. Animals (all EU Programmes)
5.1 Background
This section refers to projects with research activities involving animals.
Animal welfare is a value of the Union (Article 13 of the TFEU). Animals have an
intrinsic value which must be respected and they must be treated as sentient
creatures.
There is a wide range of EU legislation with the objective to ensure animal welfare
and which may be relevant for your projects (see below).
5.2 How to address the issues
Your activities must comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement,
and notably:
 highest ethical standards
 applicable international, EU and national law, in particular:
 for fishery/farming/aquaculture: EU Directive 98/58 on the protection
of animals kept for farming purposes, EU Regulation 1099/2009 on the
protection of animals at the time of killing and EU Regulation 889/2008
on organic production and labelling of organic products
 for research/testing on animals: EU Directive 2010/63 on the use of
animals for scientific purposes.
Some EU Member States have stricter rules.
For research/testing on animals, Directive 2010/63 aims to improve the welfare of
animals used in scientific procedures, taking into account that new scientific
knowledge is available in respect of factors influencing animal welfare as well as the
capacity of animals to sense and express pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm, to
limiting the use of animal testing for scientific purposes. It sets out EU-wide animal
welfare standards (including authorisations, restrictions on the use of certain kinds of
animals, standards for procedures, minimum requirements for personnel, recording
and traceability, care and accommodation).
This means that you must choose alternatives to animal use where possible and
implement the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement (‘three Rs’).
Replacement — replacing animal use by an alternative method or testing
strategy (without use of live animals).
Examples:
‘Higher' animals can be replaced by 'lower' animals: microorganisms, plants, eggs,
reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates may be used in some studies to replace warm-
blooded animals.
Live animals may be replaced by non-animal models, such as dummies for an
introduction to dissection for teaching the structure of the animal or the human body,
mechanical or computer models, audio-visual aids, or in vitro modelling.
Reduction — reducing the number of animals used.
Refinement — improving the breeding, accommodation and care of animals and
the methods used to minimise pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm to animals.
27EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
Moreover, you must obtain:
 the necessary authorisations for the supply of animals and the animal
experiments (and other specific authorisations, if applicable).
You must obtain all relevant national authorisations before you can start to
use animals.
Specific cases
Non-human primates (NHPs) — Since non-human primates are so close to human beings,
their use in experiments raises particular ethics concerns. Directive 2010/63 sets strict limits
to their use: They may be used only for specific research purposes (of primary importance)
and only if there is no alternative (art 8). Moreover, only offspring of non-human primates
which have been bred in captivity or which are sourced from self-sustaining colonies may be
used (art 10).
The use of great apes requires very exceptional justification and must be specifically
authorised by the granting authority.
Endangered species — Endangered species cannot be used, except for very important
research purposes and where there is no alternative non-endangered species that will meet
the scientific objective (art 7 Directive 2010/63/EU).
In this case, you should follow agreed international practices (CITES).

6. Non-EU countries (all EU Programmes)
6.1 Background
This section concerns projects with activities involving non-EU countries.
This is the case where:
 activities are conducted, partially or wholly, in a non-EU country
 participants or resources come from a non-EU country
 material is imported from or exported to a non-EU country.
Being outside the reach of European laws and standards, such activities can raise
specific ethical issues (particularly in developing countries), such as:
 exploitation of participants
 exploitation of local resources
 risks to project teams and staff
 activities (especially research) that are prohibited in the EU.
For Horizon Europe: Funding cannot be granted for activities carried out outside
the EU if they are prohibited in all Member States.7
For EDF, please note that transfers of defence-related items (including temporary
intra-EU) are subject to national regulations. It is the sole responsibility of the
participants to ensure to ensure that they hold the necessary licences (e.g. under
Directive 2009/43/EC and Council Common Position 2008/944/FFSP).
6.2 How to address the issues
Your activities must comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement,
and notably:
 highest ethical standards
 applicable international, EU and national law.
Activities carried out in a non-EU country — For activities carried out outside the
EU, it is not enough for that the activity to be accepted and comply with the legal
obligations of a non-EU country.
For Horizon Europe, the activities must ALSO be allowed in at least one Member
State.8
Beneficiaries must confirm in the ethics self-assessment section of their proposal
that this condition is met.
Resources from a non-EU country — Any use of local resources (especially animal
and/or human tissue samples, genetic material, live animals, human remains,

materials of historical value, endangered fauna or flora samples, fossils) must show
respect for cultural traditions and share benefits (i.e. also benefit local participants
and their communities, involve local stakeholders — as equal partners — and respond
to local needs).
This is particularly important for research projects in low income and lower-
middle income countries (see Convention on Biological Diversity and Declaration of
Helsinki and Global code of conduct for research in resource-poor settings). For
access to genetic resources, you must also comply with the Nagoya Protocol on
Access and Benefit Sharing and EU Regulation 511/2014 which implements this
Protocol.
Import/export of material — If genetic resources are transferred across borders, it
may be mandatory under the law of the provider country to obtain an authorisation
for the transfer. In addition, you must use an agreement which describes the
conditions for the export and the terms of utilisation and, if applicable, relevant
benefit-sharing measures. For transfers of human cells or tissues, see section 3; for
data transfers, see section 4.
Sending project teams to a non-EU country — Non-EU countries are not
necessarily less safe than EU countries. Nevertheless, a risk assessment must be
undertaken when sending project teams abroad and appropriate safety measures
must be taken. These may include insurance cover or health and safety measures,
such as no lone working, contact points via phone, counselling support, etc. (see also
section 7.2).

34EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
7. Environment, health and safety (all EU Programmes)
7.1 Background
This section concerns projects with activities that may adversely affect:
 the environment or
 the health and safety of the persons involved.
This may be due to any of the following:
 the (experimental) design of the project itself (— especially for research
projects)
 undesirable side-effects of the technologies used.
The health and safety of all human participants must be a priority in all EU projects —
especially in projects where participants may be subjects, investigators or uninvolved
third parties.
The kinds of risk to human safety vary according to the nature of the project,
discipline, topic and location. Only the ‘person in the field’ can fully assess safety
concerns and/or their willingness to tolerate risks.
However, you need to take into account that both familiar and unfamiliar settings can
involve additional safety concerns. Even in familiar settings, surprising, non-routine
things can happen which pose safety risks.
Moreover, in certain types of projects, the risk of harm to research or other staff is
caused by the activities themselves. Lack of caution or failure to obey standard
procedures may lead to physical or psychological harm.
Improved safety practices may impose additional cost burdens, which can be
included in your estimated budget.
7.2 How to address the issues
Your activities must comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement,
and notably:
 highest ethical standards
 applicable international, EU and national law, in particular:
 for environment: precautionary principle and legislation on nature
conservation and pollution control and
 for health and security: legislation on public-health control (e.g.
regulating conduct in animal epidemics, food imports, consumer
protection, etc.) and safety at work (e.g. Directive 2006/25 on the
standards for exposure of workers to risks arising from physical agents
(artificial optical radiation).
The precautionary principle requires that where there is plausible scientific evidence
for serious risks, you must prove that a new technology will not harm the
environment. The legislation on nature conservation and pollution control includes the
EU Habitats Directive 92/43, the EU Wild Birds Directive 79/409, EU Wild Fauna
Protection Regulation 338/97, the EU GMO Directive 2009/41 and the Cartagena
Protocol on Biosafety.
35EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
This means you must assess potential risks to the environment and avoid or minimise
the risks.
In relation to issues related to health and safety, you must warn and advise project
teams and staff. In some cases you must even remove them from dangerous
situations.
Moreover, you should establish and follow a set of safety checks and procedures (or a
more in-depth risk assessment) for the activities of the project teams and staff.
Moreover, you must obtain the necessary:
 environmental authorisations (if applicable)
 health and safety authorisations (if applicable)
Specific cases
Toxic chemicals and/or explosives — Staff should have adequate training in storing,
handling and disposing of such substances. If new substances and/or formulations (e.g.
nanomaterials) are developed, you must provide adequate risk assessments.
Radioactive material — Clear legislation exists in all EU countries on the storage, handling
and disposal of radioactive materials.
The release of radioactive material into the environment is allowed only if you can show
that use of alternatives (e.g. non-radioactive stable isotopes, simulants etc.) is not
possible.
Work ‘in the field’ — Establish and abide by recognised procedures to help keep teams and
participants safe. These should include:
 keeping careful notes of all work engagements
 ensuring projects are adequately staffed
 using mobile phones to keep in touch with the home base
 conducting full risk assessments of fieldwork sites
 formally notifying authorities of activities being conducted in an area
 carrying authorised identification
 preparation and training covering techniques for handling conflict, threats, abuse or
compromising situations
 debriefing after fieldwork with an assessment of safety and
 reporting of health and safety incidents.
For EDF: Please note that Member States may under certain conditions allow for
exemptions on environment, health and safety regulations where proportionally
necessary in the interest of defence (e.g. special conditions in the REACH regulation).
Participants of the activities must provide relevant national reference or licensing on
exemptions, if used.

8. Artificial intelligence (all EU Programmes)
8.1 Background
This section concerns projects with activities involving the development, deployment
and/or use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems or techniques.
Examples:
For EDF: The uses of AI in military environments could include: decision and planning
support, collaborative combat, cybersecurity and digital influence, logistics and
operational, robotics and autonomy, support services and target identification and
engaging.
The manner in which an AI solution is deployed or used may change the ethical
characteristics of the system. It is therefore important to ensure ethics compliance
even in cases where your project does not develop itself an AI based
system/technique.
A Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence
(Artificial Intelligence Act)9 is currently pending adoption by the EU legislator. This
Regulation, when it enters into force, may have effect on your project activities.
Before its adoption and entry into force, we strongly encourage beneficiaries to use
the Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) to develop
procedures to detect, assess the level and address potential risks.
8.2 How to address the issues
Your activities must comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement,
and notably:
 highest ethical standards
 applicable international, EU and national law (in particular, the the principles
and values enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and the EU
Treaties).
This requires specific ethically-focused approach during the development,
deployment, and/or use of AI-based solutions.
Any use of AI systems or techniques should be clearly described in the project and
you must demonstrate their technical robustness and safety (they must be
dependable and resilient to changes).
The approach must be built upon the following key prerequisites for ethically sound AI
systems10:
Human agency and oversight — AI systems must support human autonomy
and decision-making, enabling users to make informed autonomous decisions
regarding the AI systems. This is particularly relevant for AI systems that can
affect human behaviour by guiding, influencing or supporting humans in decision-
making processes (e.g. recommendation systems, predictive algorithms, disease
diagnosing tools). The right to human agency should be safeguarded by setting
10 As identified by the Independent High Level Expert Group on AI set up by the European Commission in
the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI.
39EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
up appropriate oversight mechanisms to prevent possible adverse effects and
uphold human autonomy.
AI systems must not subordinate, coerce, deceive or manipulate people, and
should not create attachment or stimulate addiction.
For EDF: The development of lethal autonomous weapons without the
possibility of meaningful human control over selection and engagement decisions
when carrying out strikes against humans are prohibited.11
Privacy and data governance — AI systems must guarantee privacy and data
protection throughout the system’s lifecycle. The principles of privacy by design
and by default must be taken into account in the process of designing,
developing, selecting and using AI. The quality, integrity and security of data
should be rigorously checked and adequately managed. Data minimisation and
data protection should never be leveraged to hide or obscure bias, and these
should be addressed without harming privacy rights
Transparency — All data sets and processes associated with AI decisions must
be well communicated and appropriately documented. AI systems must be
explainable and open in the communication about their limitations. The principle
of transparency is closely linked to the principles of tractability and explicability
and facilitates the implementation of human agency, data governance and human
oversight. It includes all elements relevant to an AI system (e.g. the data, the
system and the processes by which it is designed, deployed and operated).
Fairness, diversity and non-discrimination — Best possible efforts should be
made to avoid unfair bias (e.g. stemming from the used data sets or the ways the
AI is developed). AI systems should be user-centric and whenever relevant,
designed to be usable by different types of end-users with different abilities. AI
systems should avoid functional bias by offering the same level of functionality
and benefits to end-users with different abilities, beliefs, preferences and
interests, to the extent possible. Inclusion and diversity must be enabled during
the entire life cycle of the AI system. Use diverse design teams and ensure
participation of affected stakeholders to ensure objectivity and inclusiveness of
the developed systems/approaches.
Societal and environmental well-being — The impact of the developed and/or
used AI system/technique on the individual, society and environment must be
carefully evaluated and any possible risk of harm must be avoided. Increased
vigilance is needed for solutions that may potentially have significant negative
social or environmental impact. Sustainability and ecological responsibility of AI
systems should be encouraged, and research should be fostered into AI solutions
addressing areas of global concern, for instance the Sustainable Development
Goals. Overall, AI should be used to bring positive transformative changes to the
society, environment or the economy. AI systems should serve to maintain and
foster democratic processes and respect the plurality of values and life choices of
individuals; they must not undermine democratic processes, human deliberation
or democratic voting systems or pose a systemic threat to society at large.
Examples of social impact: negative impact on human rights, democratic
processes, functioning of media and mass communication, labour and labour market;
educational choices; consumer interests and consumer protection, social cohesion and
11 Article 10(6) of EDF Regulation 2021/697.
40EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
social exclusion, cultural diversity and cultural heritage, international co-operation,
mass surveillance.
Accountability — Requires that the actors involved in their development or
operation take responsibility for the way that these applications function and for
the resulting consequences. Accountability requires presupposes certain levels of
transparency as well as oversight. To be held to account, developers or operators
of AI systems must be able to explain how and why a system exhibits particular
characteristics or results in certain outcomes.
This implies that, amongst others, the developed/used AI solutions must:
 ensure that people are aware they are interacting with an AI system and are
informed (in a language and terms understandable by all) about its abilities,
limitations, risks and benefits. The manner in which this is done must be
described in the proposal
The manner in which information is provided should not depend on
particular educational backgrounds, technical knowledge, or other skills which
cannot be assumed of all people.
 prevent possible limitations on human rights and freedoms (e.g. freedom of
expression, access to information, freedom of movement etc.)
 not be designed in a way that may lead to objectification, dehumanization,
subordination, discrimination, stereotyping, coercion, manipulation of people
or creation of attachment or addiction
 be able to demonstrate compliance with the principles of data minimisation
and privacy by design and by default when processing personal data. The
principles of lawfulness, transparency and fairness of the data processing must
be respected at all times. For more information, please consult the Guidance
on ethics and data protection in research projects
 must be designed in a way to avoid bias in both input data and algorithm
design. The systems should be able to prevent potential discrimination,
stigmatisation or any other adverse effects on the individual related to the use
of the developed/deployed AI system/technique. The manner in which this is
done must be described in your project proposal
 must address the potential impact on the individual, society or the
environment. An evaluation of the potential negative individual, societal and/or
environmental impacts must be carried out and be included in the project
proposal along with the measures to be set in place to mitigate any potential
adverse effect
The ethics risk assessment and risk mitigation measures must cover the
development, deployment and post-deployment phases.
 Must not reduce the safety and wellbeing of the individuals. Whenever
relevant, the safety of the developed/used systems must be demonstrated in
the project proposal
 should be developed in a way that enables human oversight (human-in-the-
loop, human-on-the-loop, human-in-command), traceability and auditability.
Whenever possible, explanation on how decisions are taken by the
developed/used AI along with the logic behind it should be provided to the
users.
41EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
For further detailed requirements, please consult the Assessment List for Trustworthy
Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI).
The involvement of an ethics advisor/ethics advisory board with appropriate
expertise in ethics of new and emerging technologies is highly recommended for
projects which may raise significant ethics risks. This is particularly relevant for
systems that have the potential to lead to significant negative individual, social and
environmental impacts; stigmatisation or discrimination of people; interaction,
replacement or influence on human decision-making processes.
At the development stage, the implementation of the key requirements for ethically
sound AI systems can be ensured by adopting the ‘ethics by design’ approach. The
latter is aimed at preventing ethics issues from occurring by integrating ethics values-
based requirements into the design of the developed/used AI solution. The ethics by
design approach will greatly facilitate your ethics compliance. For more information,
please consult Guidelines on ethics by design for AI.
Some types of objectives, methodologies, system architecture or design may be
inherently problematic (due to serious ethical non-compliance). This is the case for
instance for AI systems that risk to:
 limit human rights, subordinate, deceive or manipulate people, violate bodily
or mental integrity, create attachment or addiction, or hide the fact people are
interacting with an AI system
 cause people to be disadvantaged socially or politically, reduce the power that
they have over their lives, or result in discrimination, either by the system, or
by the way it will be used
 cause people to suffer physical, psychological or financial harm, cause
environmental damage, or significantly damage social processes and
institutions (for example, by contributing to misinformation of the public).
For all issues related to the involvement of humans, data protection, safety and
environmental impacts, please consult the relevant sections of this guidance.

9. Other ethics issues (all EU Programmes)
9.1 Background
Since many EU programmes intend to support innovative activities, it may be that
your project raises new ethical issues and concerns that are currently not (fully)
covered by the standard questions in the Ethics Issue Table (e.g. new developments
in the fields of neurobiology, man-machine interaction, developments in
nanotechnology, genetic enhancement, the creation of androids and cyborgs, etc.).
9.2 How to address the issues
If you know of any other ethically relevant issues, describe them in this section and
explain how you intend to address them. This allows you to alert the granting
authority in time and get appropriate assistance for addressing them. It also avoids
the problems you would have, if such issues were found out later (in the context of an
audit or investigation).
For highly innovative activities, use the ethics by design methodology (in particular in
the area of artificial intelligence; see section 8).
If, ethical issues arise unexpectedly during your project, contact us immediately
via your Funding & Tenders Portal account and provide detailed information on the
issue and how you intend to handle it. We will ensure that you receive appropriate
help and guidance.
Ethics advisers/advisory boards
A suitably experienced ethics advisor can help you to deal with ethical issues and putting
into place the procedures to handle these appropriately if your project includes several
ethical concerns.
If your project involves several significant or complex ethical issues, you should appoint an
ethics advisory board with several experts with varied expertise.
If you appoint an ethics advisor/advisory board, it is important that they are:
 external to the project and to the host institution
 totally independent and
 free from any conflict of interest.
Your university or institution (or members of your consortium) may have experience with
an ethics advisor or members of an ethics advisory board and may be in a position to
suggest potential candidates.
The ethics advisor/ethics advisory board should maintain an overview of the work
throughout the whole course of your project and help you to think ahead about possible
problems that might arise and how they could be addressed. Their experience will help you
check for compliance with ethical standards in the relevant fields. They will also be
responsible for reporting to you and to the granting authority, on a regular basis, on ethics
concerns as they arise and the continuing probity of your project work.
If you appoint an ethics advisor or set up an ethics advisory board, you should work with
them on a regular basis throughout your project. Their oversight role should be fully
integrated into your project activities and they should work closely with you and your
colleagues so they are fully aware of all the developments as your project progresses. Your
ethics advisor/ethics advisory board should be an essential element in your project
management structure.
What do you need to provide?

10. Crosscutting issue: potential misuse of results (all EU Programmes)
This section concerns projects with activities that involve or generate materials,
methods, technologies or knowledge that could be misused for unethical purposes.
Although projects are usually carried out with benign intentions, they may have
the potential to harm humans, animals or the environment.
For Horizon Europe and DEP: This section is complementary to the Security Issues
Table, where you must flag issues concerning security classification or security rules
(for instance activities that could result in the development of chemical, biological,
radiological or nuclear (CBRN) weapons or provide knowledge, materials and
technologies that could be adapted for criminal/terrorist activities). Any potential
issues not covered in the Security Issues Table should be flagged in the Ethics Issue
Table and analysed under the relevant ethics sections (humans, personal data,
animals, environment, health and safety, artificial intelligence, other ethics issues,
etc).
To identify any possible misuse, start by considering the risks associated with the
activities you plan and any unethical ways in which the materials, methods,
technologies and knowledge involved could be used.
Activities most vulnerable to misuse could include:
- the development of surveillance technologies that could curtail human rights
and civil liberties
- the involvement of minority or vulnerable groups or the development of social,
behavioural or genetic profiling technologies that could be misused to
stigmatise, discriminate against, harass or intimidate people
- the development of materials/methods/technologies and knowledge that could
harm humans, animals or the environment if they were released, modified or
enhanced
- in general, the development of materials/methods/technologies and knowledge
that could serve purposes other than those intended, and if so, in unethical
ways.
This guide does not cover research misconduct (e.g. falsification of research
results, fabrication of scientific evidence and plagiarism).
10.1 How to address the issues
Some questions that could be used to identify potential misuse are:
 Could the materials/methods/technologies and knowledge involved or
generated harm humans, animals or the environment if they were modified or
enhanced?
 Could the materials/methods/technologies and knowledge involved or
generated serve purposes other than those intended? If so, would such use be
unethical?
There are various ways to mitigate risk. Depending on the activity planned and the
potential misuse, applicants may choose to:
- take additional safety measures, e.g. compulsory safety training for staff
- adjust the project design, e.g. use dummy data
48EU Grants: How to complete your ethics self-assessment: V2.0 – 13.07.2021
- limit dissemination, e.g. by publishing only part of the results, regulating
export, etc
- appoint an independent ethics advisor or an ethics advisory board with experts
from different backgrounds.
If you are planning activities that may give rise to concerns about potential misuse,
you will need to do the following when preparing your proposal:
- provide a risk-assessment and explain how you will prevent misuse
- if required, attach copies of health and safety authorisations, and ethics
approvals if relevant
- details on applicable international, EU and national laws that address concerns
relating to potential misuse of materials/methods/technologies and knowledge
that could harm humans, animals or the environment if they were released,
modified or enhanced.
Specific cases
Activities with a potential impact on human rights — Concerns in this field relate primarily to
surveillance technologies, new data-gathering and data-merging technologies (e.g. in the context
of big data). However, social or genetic research that could lead to discrimination or stigmatisation
is also affected.
Risk mitigation measures may include:
 a human rights impact assessment
 involving human rights experts in your project
 training personnel and/or technological safeguards
 caution when publishing or otherwise disseminating results (e.g. through privacy by
design)
 adapting the project design (e.g. using dummy data).

therefore be attributed to it directly are eligible. They must not include any indirect costs (i.e.
costs that are only indirectly linked to the action, e.g. via cost drivers).
6.2 Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category
For each budget category, the specific eligibility conditions are as follows:
Direct costs
A. Personnel costs
A.1 Costs for employees (or equivalent) are eligible as personnel costs, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions and are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an
employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the action.
They must be limited to salaries, social security contributions, taxes and other costs linked to
the remuneration, if they arise from national law or the employment contract (or equivalent
appointing act) and be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred, in accordance
with the following method:
{daily rate for the person
multiplied by
number of day-equivalents worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The daily rate must be calculated as:
{annual personnel costs for the person
divided by
22Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
215}
The number of day-equivalents declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see
Article 20).
The total number of day-equivalents declared in EU grants, for a person for a year, cannot be
higher than 215.
The personnel costs may also include supplementary payments for personnel assigned to the
action (including payments on the basis of supplementary contracts regardless of their nature),
if:
- it is part of the beneficiary’s usual remuneration practices and is paid in a consistent
manner whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required
- the criteria used to calculate the supplementary payments are objective and generally
applied by the beneficiary, regardless of the source of funding used.
If the beneficiary uses average personnel costs (unit cost according to usual cost accounting
practices), the personnel costs must fulfil the general eligibility conditions for such unit costs
and the daily rate must be calculated:
- using the actual personnel costs recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts and excluding
any costs which are ineligible or already included in other budget categories; the
actual personnel costs may be adjusted on the basis of budgeted or estimated elements,
if they are relevant for calculating the personnel costs, reasonable and correspond to
objective and verifiable information
and
- according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner,
based on objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
A.2 and A.3 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract other than an
employment contract and costs for seconded persons by a third party against payment are
also eligible as personnel costs, if they are assigned to the action, fulfil the general eligibility
conditions and:
(a) work under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way
the work is organised, the tasks that are performed and the premises where they are
performed) and
(b) the result of the work belongs to the beneficiary (unless agreed otherwise).
They must be calculated on the basis of a rate which corresponds to the costs actually incurred
for the direct contract or secondment and must not be significantly different from those for
personnel performing similar tasks under an employment contract with the beneficiary.
23Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
A.4 The work of SME owners for the action (i.e. owners of beneficiaries that are small and
medium-sized enterprises18 not receiving a salary) or natural person beneficiaries (i.e.
beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary) may be declared as personnel
costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.
B. Subcontracting costs
Subcontracting costs for the action (including related duties, taxes and charges, such as non-
deductible or non-refundable value added tax (VAT)) are eligible, if they are calculated on the
basis of the costs actually incurred, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are awarded
using the beneficiary’s usual purchasing practices — provided these ensure subcontracts with
best value for money (or if appropriate the lowest price) and that there is no conflict of
interests (see Article 12).
Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU
Directives on public procurement must also comply with the applicable national law on public
procurement.
[OPTION if selected for the call: The beneficiaries must ensure that the subcontracted work is
performed in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions — unless
otherwise approved by the granting authority.]
[OPTION if selected for the grant19: Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the
action.]
The tasks to be subcontracted and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in
Annex 1 and the total estimated costs of subcontracting per beneficiary must be set out in
Annex 2 (or may be approved ex post in the periodic report, if the use of subcontracting does
not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; ‘simplified approval
procedure’).
C. Purchase costs
Purchase costs for the action (including related duties, taxes and charges, such as non-
deductible or non-refundable value added tax (VAT)) are eligible if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions and are bought using the beneficiary’s usual purchasing practices —
18 For the definition, see Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC: micro, small or medium-sized
enterprise (SME) are enterprises
- engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of their legal form (including, in particular, self-
employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or other activities, and partnerships or
associations regularly engaged in an economic activity) and
- employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of
the Recommendation) and which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an
annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million.
19 This is a standard obligation for all EU grants. It may be unselected only for actions where subcontracting is
a key/large part of the action (e.g infrastructure projects; PCP/PPI; technical assistance, statistical
programmes, etc).
24Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES AND
OTHER PARTICIPANTS
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting
authority for implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance
with all the obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action
under their own responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated
entities or other participants (see Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the
granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the
beneficiaries fails to implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure
that this part is implemented by someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the
maximum grant amount and subject to an amendment; see Article 39). The financial
responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding
the grant for the entire duration of the action. Costs and contributions will be eligible only as
long as the beneficiary and the action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see
Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the
implementation of the action (see Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the prefinancing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements
(CFS) (if required; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article
21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority
under the Agreement
31Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their
affiliated entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and
the granting authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies
otherwise, and in particular:
- submit the prefinancing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify
their quality and completeness before passing them on to the granting
authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other
beneficiaries (report on the distribution of payments; if required, see
Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other
beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other
beneficiary or third party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii)
last indent and (iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have
created or which are controlled by or affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains
sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance with the obligations under the
Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’29 (or similar, such as European research
infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to
one of their members. The coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the
obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-
ordination, to ensure that the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
29 For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy
the criteria for being awarded a grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole
beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the purpose of implementing the action
financed by the grant.”
32Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of
recoveries (if any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article
16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked actions, the beneficiaries must have
arrangements with the participants of the other action, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the
consortium is the same, as part of their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of
outputs, common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy
activities, common communication and dissemination activities, sharing of
information, access to background and results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in
both actions.
The arrangements with the participants of the other action must not contain any provision
contrary to this Agreement.]
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
[OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The following entities which are linked to a beneficiary
will participate in the action as ‘affiliated entities’:
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short
name)]

Their costs and contributions will be included in Annex 2 and will be taken into account for
the calculation of the grant.
The beneficiaries must ensure that all their obligations under this Agreement also apply to
their affiliated entities.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority,
OLAF, Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the affiliated
entities.
Breaches by affiliated entities will be handled in the same manner as breaches by
beneficiaries. Recovery of undue amounts will be handled through the beneficiaries.
If the granting authority requires joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see Data
Sheet, Point 4.4), they must sign the declaration set out in Annex 3a and may be held liable in
case of enforced recoveries against their beneficiaries (see Article 22.2 and 22.4).]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable]
ARTICLE 9 — OTHER PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN THE ACTION
9.1 Associated partners
[OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The following entities which cooperate with a
beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘associated partners’:

partners.]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable]
9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions to the action
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment,
other goods, works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge), if necessary for the
implementation.
34Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not
charge costs or contributions to the action and the costs for the in-kind contributions are not
eligible.
The third parties and their in-kind contributions should be set out in Annex 1.
9.3 Subcontractors
Subcontractors may participate in the action, if necessary for the implementation.
Subcontractors must implement their action tasks in accordance with Article 11. The costs for

authority, OLAF, Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the
recipients.
ARTICLE 10 — PARTICIPANTS WITH SPECIAL STATUS
10.1 Non-EU participants
Participants which are established in a non-EU country (if any) undertake to comply with
their obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical
principles, environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information,
intellectual property rights, visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
35Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use qualified external auditors
which are independent and comply with comparable standards as those set out in EU
Directive 2006/43/EC30
- for the controls under Article 25: to allow for checks, reviews, audits and
investigations (including on-the-spot checks, visits and inspections) by the bodies
mentioned in that Article (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court of Auditors (ECA),
etc.).
Special rules on dispute settlement apply (see Data Sheet, Point 5).
10.2 Participants which are international organisations
Participants which are international organisations (IOs; if any) undertake to comply with their
obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical
principles, environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information,
intellectual property rights, visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use either independent public
officers or external auditors which comply with comparable standards as those set out
in EU Directive 2006/43/EC31
- for the controls under Article 25: to allow for the checks, reviews, audits and
investigations by the bodies mentioned in that Article, taking into account the specific
agreements concluded by them and the EU (if any).
For such participants, nothing in the Agreement will be interpreted as a waiver of their
privileges or immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or international law.
Special rules on applicable law and dispute settlement apply (see Article 43 and Data Sheet,
Point 5).
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
Pillar-assessed participants (if any) may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in so
far as they have been positively assessed and do not call into question the decision awarding
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and
procedures which participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control
system, accounting system, external audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and
exclusion, information on recipients and protection of personal data; see Article 157 EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
30 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of
annual accounts and consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
31 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of
annual accounts and consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
36Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and
procedures, in particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards,
rules and procedures
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in
accordance with usual accounting practices
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, prefinancing guarantees are not
needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their
regular internal or external auditors and in accordance with their internal
financial regulations and procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if
those practices are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no
recovery if the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue
amounts from the third party receiving the support (including legal proceedings)
and non-recovery is not due to an error or negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be
conducted taking into account the rules and procedures specifically agreed
between them and the framework agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the
participant’s internal rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment
will be calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into
before the pre-information letter was received and could not reasonably be
terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated
for damage it sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because
the action was not implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the
damage is due to an infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures
or due to a violation of third parties’ rights by the participant or one of its
employees or individual for whom the employees are responsible.
37Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do
purchases, subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance
with their internal rules and procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal
standards, rules and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the
grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use),
communication, dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems,
rules and procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules
and procedures that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately
inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU,
may moreover — under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the
decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries) — rely on the provisions set out in that framework agreement.

44Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The emblem must remain distinct and separate and cannot be modified by adding other visual
marks, brands or text.
Apart from the emblem, no other visual identity or logo may be used to highlight the EU
support.
When displayed in association with other logos (e.g. of beneficiaries or sponsors), the emblem
must be displayed at least as prominently and visibly as the other logos.
For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the emblem
without first obtaining approval from the granting authority. This does not, however, give
them the right to exclusive use. Moreover, they may not appropriate the emblem or any
similar trademark or logo, either by registration or by any other means.
17.3 Quality of information — Disclaimer
Any communication or dissemination activity related to the action must use factually accurate
information.
Moreover, it must indicate the following disclaimer (translated into local languages where

of any of the following:
(a) events which are likely to affect or delay the implementation of the action or affect the
EU’s financial interests, in particular:
(i) changes in their legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership
situation (including changes linked to one of the exclusion grounds listed in
the declaration of honour signed before grant signature)
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action information: not applicable] [OPTION
2 if selected for the grant: changes regarding the linked action (see Article 3)]
(b) circumstances affecting:
(i) the decision to award the grant or
(ii) compliance with requirements under the Agreement.
19. 4 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced
(see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
20.1 Keeping records and supporting documents
The beneficiaries must — at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6) —
keep records and other supporting documents to prove the proper implementation of the
action in line with the accepted standards in the respective field (if any).
46Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
In addition, the beneficiaries must — for the same period — keep the following to justify the
amounts declared:
(a) for actual costs: adequate records and supporting documents to prove the costs
declared (such as contracts, subcontracts, invoices and accounting records); in
addition, the beneficiaries’ usual accounting and internal control procedures must
enable direct reconciliation between the amounts declared, the amounts recorded in
their accounts and the amounts stated in the supporting documents
(b) for flat-rate costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting
documents to prove the eligibility of the costs or contributions to which the flat-rate is
applied
(c) for the following simplified costs and contributions: the beneficiaries do not need to
keep specific records on the actual costs incurred, but must keep:
(i) for unit costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting
documents to prove the number of units declared
(ii) for lump sum costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and
supporting documents to prove proper implementation of the work as
described in Annex 1
(iii) for financing not linked to costs (if any): adequate records and supporting
documents to prove the achievement of the results or the fulfilment of the

(d) for unit, flat-rate and lump sum costs and contributions according to usual cost
accounting practices (if any): the beneficiaries must keep any adequate records and
supporting documents to prove that their cost accounting practices have been applied
in a consistent manner, based on objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding,
and that they comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Articles 6.1 and 6.2.
Moreover, the following is needed for specific budget categories:
(e) for personnel costs: time worked for the beneficiary under the action must be
supported by declarations signed monthly by the person and their supervisor, unless
another reliable time-record system is in place; the granting authority may accept
alternative evidence supporting the time worked for the action declared, if it considers
that it offers an adequate level of assurance
(f) additional record-keeping rules: not applicable.
The records and supporting documents must be made available upon request (see Article 19)
or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of
claims under the Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 25), the
beneficiaries must keep these records and other supporting documentation until the end of
these procedures.
47Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are
considered originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The granting
authority may accept non-original documents if they offer a comparable level of assurance.
20.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
21.1 Continuous reporting
The beneficiaries must report on the progress of the action (e.g. deliverables, milestones,
outputs/outcomes, critical risks, indicators, etc; if any), in the Portal Continuous Reporting
tool and in accordance with the timing and conditions it sets out (as agreed with the granting
authority).
Standardised deliverables (e.g. progress reports not linked to payments, reports on cumulative
expenditure, special reports, etc; if any) must be submitted using the templates published on
the Portal.
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
In addition, the beneficiaries must provide reports to request payments, in accordance with the
schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2):
- for additional prefinancings (if any): an additional prefinancing report
- for interim payments (if any) and the final payment: a periodic report.
The prefinancing and periodic reports include a technical and financial part.
The technical part includes an overview of the action implementation. It must be prepared
using the template available in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool.
The financial part of the additional prefinancing report includes a statement on the use of the
previous prefinancing payment.
The financial part of the periodic report includes:
- the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all beneficiaries/affiliated
entities)
- the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
- the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2 and
Data Sheet, Point 4.3).
The financial statements must detail the eligible costs and contributions for each budget
category and, for the final payment, also the revenues for the action (see Articles 6 and 22).
48Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
All eligible costs and contributions incurred should be declared, even if they exceed the
amounts indicated in the estimated budget (see Annex 2). Amounts that are not declared in the
individual financial statements will not be taken into account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statements (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the
beneficiaries confirm that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the costs and contributions declared are eligible (see Article 6)
- the costs and contributions can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting
documents (see Article 20) that will be produced upon request (see Article 19) or in
the context of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 25)
- for the final periodic report: all the revenues have been declared (if required; see
Article 22).
Beneficiaries will have to submit also the financial statements of their affiliated entities (if
any). In case of recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the
financial statements of their affiliated entities.
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
The financial statements must be drafted in euro.
Beneficiaries with general accounts established in a currency other than the euro must convert
the costs recorded in their accounts into euro, at the average of the daily exchange rates
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website),
calculated over the corresponding reporting period.
If no daily euro exchange rate is published in the Official Journal for the currency in question,
they must be converted at the average of the monthly accounting exchange rates published on
the European Commission website (InforEuro), calculated over the corresponding reporting
period.
Beneficiaries with general accounts in euro must convert costs incurred in another currency
into euro according to their usual accounting practices.
21.4 Reporting language
The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
21.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a report submitted does not comply with this Article, the granting authority may suspend
the payment deadline (see Article 29) and apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the
grant or the coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in
Chapter 5.

EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
ARTICLE 22 — PAYMENTS AND RECOVERIES — CALCULATION OF
AMOUNTS DUE
22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.2) and must be distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to
distribution of the initial prefinancing payment; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment
obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date
when they are debited to its account.
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it
turns out that the granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts
undue.
The general liability regime for recoveries (first-line liability) is as follows: At final payment,
the coordinator will be fully liable for recoveries, even if it has not been the final recipient of
the undue amounts. At beneficiary termination or after final payment, recoveries will be made
directly against the beneficiaries concerned.
Beneficiaries will be fully liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4):
- the beneficiaries will be jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of another
beneficiary under the Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
- affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of their beneficiaries under the
Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority
(see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).
22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Prefinancing payments
The aim of the prefinancing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
50Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
For additional prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous
prefinancing payment shows that less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data
Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the 70% threshold and the amount used.
Prefinancing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent)
against amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to
that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
In case of beneficiary termination, the granting authority will determine the provisional
amount due for the beneficiary concerned. Payments (if any) will be made with the next
interim or final payment.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary
for all reporting periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the
funding rate to the accepted costs of the beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower
contribution to costs and CFS threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the
contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked to
costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the
distribution of payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{ total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments received (if
any)}}.
If the balance is positive, the amount will be included in the next interim or final payment to
the consortium.
51Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this
amount to be paid to the coordinator (confirmation letter).
The amounts will later on also be taken into account for the next interim or final payment.
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible costs and contributions claimed for the
implementation of the action during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out
the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply
recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the
reporting period, by first calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the
funding rate to the accepted costs of each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a
lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding
the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked
to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary
termination (if any). The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of prefinancing and
interim payments (if any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
52Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the remaining part of the eligible
costs and contributions claimed for the implementation of the action (if any).
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report. Its approval does not imply
recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all
reporting periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the
funding rate to the total accepted costs of each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a
lower contribution to costs, CFS threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the
contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked to
costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
If the resulting amount is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.2, it will
be limited to the latter.
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
If the no-profit rule is provided for in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2), the grant must not
produce a profit (i.e. surplus of the amount obtained following Step 2 plus the action’s
revenues, over the eligible costs and contributions approved by the granting authority).
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4), for
beneficiaries that are profit legal entities.
53Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
If there is a profit, it will be deducted in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of the
eligible costs approved by the granting authority (as compared to the amount calculated
following Steps 1 and 2 minus the contributions).
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of prefinancing
and interim payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{
final grant amount
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments made (if
any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and date for payment.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see
Article 25) — the granting authority rejects costs or contributions (see Article 27) or reduces
the grant (see Article 28), it will calculate the revised final grant amount for the beneficiary
concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
54Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the
beneficiary, by calculating the ‘revised accepted costs’ and ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total
accepted EU contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its
share in the final grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is
calculated as follows:
{{
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the
action}
multiplied by
}
final grant amount for the action .
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons
why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be
recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent —
against any amounts owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may
be offset before the payment date specified in the debit note.
55Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU
executive agency, debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other
Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) by drawing on the financial guarantee(s) (if any)
(c) by holding other beneficiaries jointly and severally liable (if any; see Data Sheet, Point
4.4)
(d) by holding affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point
4.4) or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that granting authority is the
European Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable
decision under Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and
Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in
Article 22.5, from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including
the date the full payment is received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and
then against the principal.
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless
Directive 2015/236635 applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by
offsetting or enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission
(see also Article 43).
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the
beneficiaries are entitled to late-payment interest at the reference rate applied by the
European Central Bank (ECB) for its main refinancing operations in euros, plus the
percentage specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The ECB reference rate to be used is the
rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as published
in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the
coordinator only on request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional
and local government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State
for the purpose of this Agreement).
35 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment
services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and
Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (OJ L 337, 23.12.2015, p. 35).
56Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not
be considered as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for
payment (see above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.
22.5.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28) and the grant or the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 23 — GUARANTEES
23.1 Prefinancing guarantee
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2), the beneficiaries must
provide (one or more) prefinancing guarantee(s) in accordance with the timing and the
amounts set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them to the granting authority in due time before the
prefinancing they are linked to.
The guarantees must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the
following conditions:
(a) be provided by a bank or approved financial institution established in the EU or — if
requested by the coordinator and accepted by the granting authority — by a third party
or a bank or financial institution established outside the EU offering equivalent
security
(b) the guarantor stands as first-call guarantor and does not require the granting authority
to first have recourse against the principal debtor (i.e. the beneficiary concerned) and
(c) remain explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the
form of a recovery, until five months after the debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
They will be released within the following month.
23.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If the beneficiaries breach their obligation to provide the prefinancing guarantee, the
prefinancing will not be paid.
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 24 — CERTIFICATES
24.1 Operational verification report (OVR)
Not applicable
57Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
24.2 Certificate on the financial statements (CFS)
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.3), the beneficiaries must
provide certificates on their financial statements (CFS), in accordance with the schedule,
threshold and conditions set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them as part of the periodic report (see Article 21).
The certificates must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal, cover the costs
declared on the basis of actual costs and costs according to usual cost accounting practices (if
any), and fulfil the following conditions:
(a) be provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent and
complies with Directive 2006/43/EC36 (or for public bodies: by a competent
independent public officer)
(b) the verification must be carried out according to the highest professional standards to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the provisions under the Agreement
and that the costs declared are eligible.
The certificates will not affect the granting authority's right to carry out its own checks,
reviews or audits, nor preclude the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Public
Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) or the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) from using their
prerogatives for audits and investigations under the Agreement (see Article 25).
If the costs (or a part of them) were already audited by the granting authority, these costs do
not need to be covered by the certificate and will not be counted for calculating the threshold
(if any).
24.3 Certificate on the compliance of usual cost accounting practices (CoMUC)
Beneficiaries which use unit, flat rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to usual
costs accounting practices (if any) may submit to the granting authority, for approval, a
certificate on the methodology stating that their usual cost accounting practices comply with
the eligibility conditions under the Agreement.
The certificate must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the
following conditions:
(a) be provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent and
complies with Directive 2006/43/EC37 (or for public bodies: by a competent
independent public officer)
(b) the verification must be carried out according to the highest professional standards to
ensure that the methodology for declaring costs according to usual accounting
practices complies with the provisions under the Agreement.

If the certificate is approved, costs declared in line with this methodology will not be
challenged subsequently, unless the beneficiary concealed information for the purpose of the
approval.
24.4 Systems and process audit (SPA)
Not applicable
24.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary does not submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) or the
certificate is rejected, the accepted EU contribution to costs will be capped to reflect the CFS
threshold.
If a beneficiary breaches any of its other obligations under this Article, the granting authority
may apply the measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 25 — CHECKS, REVIEWS, AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS —
EXTENSION OF FINDINGS
25.1 Granting authority checks, reviews and audits
25.1.1 Internal checks
The granting authority may — during the action or afterwards — check the proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the obligations under the Agreement,
including assessing costs and contributions, deliverables and reports.
25.1.2 Project reviews
The granting authority may carry out reviews on the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Agreement (general project reviews or specific
issues reviews).

outside experts, the coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right
to object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the
deadline requested — any information and data in addition to deliverables and reports already
submitted (including information on the use of resources). The granting authority may request
beneficiaries to provide such information to it directly. Sensitive information and documents
will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings,
including with the outside experts.
59Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises
(including to the outside experts) and must ensure that information requested is readily
available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested,
including electronic format.
On the basis of the review findings, a project review report will be drawn up.

The granting authority may carry out audits on the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Agreement.
Such audits may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the beneficiary
concerned and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
The granting authority may use its own audit service, delegate audits to a centralised service
or use external audit firms. If it uses an external firm, the beneficiary concerned will be
informed and have the right to object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of
interest.
The beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline
requested — any information (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or
other personal data) to verify compliance with the Agreement. Sensitive information and
documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises
(including for the external audit firm) and must ensure that information requested is readily
available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested,
including electronic format.
On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which
has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and
will be formally notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement.

EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights
of checks, reviews and audits as the granting authority.
25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the
periodic assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.
25.4 OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
The following bodies may also carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations — during
the action or afterwards:
38
- the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) under Regulations No 883/2013 and No
39
2185/96
- the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) under Regulation 2017/1939
- the European Court of Auditors (ECA) under Article 287 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 263 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If requested by these bodies, the beneficiary concerned must provide full, accurate and
complete information in the format requested (including complete accounts, individual salary
statements or other personal data, including in electronic format) and allow access to sites and
premises for on-the-spot visits or inspections — as provided for under these Regulations.
To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the
action, at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until
any ongoing checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have
been concluded.
25.5 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations — Extension of
findings
25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures
described in Chapter 5.
38 Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September
2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation
(Euratom) No 1074/1999 (OJ L 248, 18/09/2013, p. 1).
39 Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and
inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests
against fraud and other irregularities (OJ L 292, 15/11/1996, p. 2).
61Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount
(see Article 22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may
lead to a request for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set
out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities,
fraud or breach of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU
grants awarded under similar conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Findings of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this
grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions, to have committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or
breach of obligations that have a material impact on this grant and
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the
list of grants affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to
extend the findings and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of costs or contributions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors, to calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or
practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
- an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
- the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations,
revised financial statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction
method/rate.
62Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the
implementation (i.e. start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the
revised financial statements or the announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see
Articles 27 and 28).
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the
objectives and indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit
set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or
beneficiaries and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact
of the action, including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may
apply the measures described in Chapter 5.
CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at beneficiary termination, interim payment, final payment or
afterwards — reject any costs or contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in
particular following checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant
(see Article 25).
Ineligible costs or contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The
63Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification —
submit observations if it disagrees with the rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions, it will deduct them from the costs or
contributions declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery;
see Article 22).
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards —
reduce the grant for a beneficiary, if:
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and
proportionate to the seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach
of obligations, by applying an individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the
reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving
notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the reduction (payment review
procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
64Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the
amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment
cannot be processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or
additional information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing extension procedure,
queries about eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons
why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will
be lifted — and the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to
confirm if the suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the
revised report is not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority
may also terminate the grant or the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for
one or more beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
65Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make
partial payment(s) for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the
payment (or recovery) of the remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to
be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the
coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting
authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the
suspension end date.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For
interim payments, the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article
21) must not contain any financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated
entities). The coordinator must include them in the next periodic report after the suspension is
lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of the action — in the last periodic report.
ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional
circumstances — in particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation
impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
66Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- the reasons why
- the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission
of the amendment request and
- the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately
request another amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption
date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes
necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been
terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the suspension end
date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for
activities implemented during grant suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(c) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA suspension grounds: not applicable.
31.2.2 Procedure
67Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification).
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority
will formally notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the
suspension end date and invite the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to
set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the
grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the
suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be before the date
on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for
activities implemented during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see
Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a
beneficiary (see Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the grant terminated improperly.
68Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a
periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of
the report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities
implemented before the end of work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after the end of work are not eligible.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries,
on request of the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment
request must be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
69Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting
period until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the
financial statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the
certificate on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data
Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary;
change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the
report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities
implemented before the end of work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after the end of work are not eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the
next reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs
and contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account
(no costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into
question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant
termination (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21
(reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27
(rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.3 EU-initiated GA or beneficiary termination
32.3.1 Conditions

70Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(b) a change to the action or the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership
situation of a beneficiary is likely to substantially affect the implementation of the
action or calls into question the decision to award the grant (including changes linked
to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour)
(c) following termination of one or more beneficiaries, the necessary changes to the
Agreement (and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
(d) implementation of the action has become impossible or the changes necessary for its
continuation would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants
(e) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is subject to bankruptcy
proceedings or similar (including insolvency, winding-up, administration by a
liquidator or court, arrangement with creditors, suspension of business activities, etc.)
(f) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is in breach of social
security or tax obligations
(g) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been found guilty of
grave professional misconduct
(h) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,

(j) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:

71Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(l) despite a specific request by the granting authority, a beneficiary does not request —
through the coordinator — an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of
one of its affiliated entities or associated partners that is in one of the situations under
points (d), (f), (e), (g), (h), (i) or (j) and to reallocate its tasks, or
(m) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA termination grounds: not applicable.
32.3.2 Procedure
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting
authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will
take effect (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is
discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also
inform the coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit
a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the
basis of the report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and
contributions for activities implemented before termination takes effect (see Article
22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after termination are not
eligible.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator
may not submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
72Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see
Article 28) or to impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority
(see Article 33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —
submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open
reporting period until termination, containing an overview of the progress
of the work, the financial statement, the explanation on the use of
resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on the financial statement
(CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated
beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of
the report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for
activities implemented before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating
to contracts due for execution only after termination are not eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report
for the next reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline,
only costs and contributions included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments
within the deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned
and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
73Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal
treatment of applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.

beneficiaries or other participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the
implementation of the Agreement.
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a

loss of profit, loss of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by
wilful act or by a breach of confidentiality.
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES

sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public
law measures, in addition or as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this
Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to 148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and

SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot
be considered in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants
involved in the action) and
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without
delay, stating the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force
majeure and do their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.
CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal, in accordance with the
Portal Terms and Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if
explicitly instructed otherwise by the granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the grant agreement (project
number and acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and
Conditions. For naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated —
before the signature of this Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’.
The role and tasks of the LEAR are stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms
and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the
Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of
sending, as indicated by the time logs.
75Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the
communication is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not
been accessed within 10 days after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general
principles apply (i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with
proof of delivery will be considered to have been received either on the delivery date
registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be
considered in breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Addresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is
the official mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.
ARTICLE 37 — INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT
The provisions in the Data Sheet take precedence over the rest of the Terms and Conditions of
the Agreement.
Annex 5 takes precedence over the Terms and Conditions; the Terms and Conditions take
precedence over the Annexes other than Annex 5.
Annex 2 takes precedence over Annex 1.
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7141, periods expressed in days, months or years are
calculated from the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement
which would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
41 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to
periods, dates and time-limits (OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
76Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in
the Portal Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries
(see Annex 3). If a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission
must be done by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or
proof that this opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45
days of receiving notification (or any additional information the granting authority has
requested). If it does not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same
deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no
notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the
amendment.
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession
form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry
into force of the Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
its entry into force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must
— within 30 days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and
make any changes necessary to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not
affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
77Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with
Article 39. It must include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary
directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the
grant to a new beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal
Amendment tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE
GRANTING AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting
authority to any third party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority
on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed,
the assignment will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations
towards the granting authority.
ARTICLE 43 — APPLICABLE LAW AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
43.1 Applicable law
The Agreement is governed by the applicable EU law, supplemented if necessary by the law
of Belgium.
Special rules may apply for beneficiaries which are international organisations (if any; see
Data Sheet, Point 5).
78Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties
must bring action before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice —
under Article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium — unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU
court judgements.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet,
Point 5), the dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in
accordance with the Rules for Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under
Article 299 TFEU (see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the
General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions
against offsetting and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European
Commission (not against the granting authority; see also Article 22).
ARTICLE 44 — ENTRY INTO FORCE
The Agreement will enter into force on the day of signature by the granting authority or the
coordinator, depending on which is later.

SPECIFIC RULES
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY (— ARTICLE 13)
Sensitive information with security recommendation
Sensitive information with a security recommendation must comply with the additional
requirements imposed by the granting authority.
Before starting the action tasks concerned, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals
or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task. The documents must be
kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting authority. If they
are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary.
For requirements restricting disclosure or dissemination, the information must be handled in
accordance with the recommendation and may be disclosed or disseminated only after written
approval from the granting authority.
EU classified information
If EU classified information is used or generated by the action, it must be treated in
accordance with the security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter (SAL) set
out in Annex 1 and Decision 2015/44445 and its implementing rules — until it is declassified.
Deliverables which contain EU classified information must be submitted according to special
procedures agreed with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving EU classified information may be subcontracted only with prior
explicit written approval from the granting authority and only to entities established in an EU
Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of information agreement with the EU
(or an administrative arrangement with the Commission).
EU classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants
involved in the action implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the
granting authority.
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14)
Ethics
Actions involving activities raising ethics issues must be carried out in compliance with:
45 Commission Decision 2015/444/EC, Euratom of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p. 53).
87Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- ethical principles
and
- applicable EU, international and national law, including the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms and its Supplementary Protocols.
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality, the right to
privacy, the right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental
integrity of persons, the right to non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the
environment and high levels of human health protection.
Before the beginning of an action task raising an ethical issue, the beneficiaries must have
obtained all approvals or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task,
notably from any (national or local) ethics committee or other bodies such as data protection
authorities.
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the
granting authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English
summary, which shows that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the
conclusions of the committee or authority concerned (if any).
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) — BACKGROUND AND RESULTS —
ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE (— ARTICLE 16)
Definitions
Access rights — Rights to use results or background.
Dissemination — The public disclosure of the results by appropriate means, other than
resulting from protecting or exploiting the results, including by scientific or
professional publications in any medium.
Exploit(ation) — The use of results in further innovation and deployment activities other than
those covered by the action concerned, including among other things,
commercial exploitation such as developing, creating, manufacturing and
marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in
standardisation activities.
Fair and reasonable conditions — Appropriate conditions, including possible financial terms
or royalty-free conditions, taking into account the specific circumstances of
the request for access, for example the actual or potential value of the results
or background to which access is requested and/or the scope, duration or
other characteristics of the exploitation envisaged.
List of background — Background free from restrictions
The beneficiaries must, where industrial and intellectual property rights (including rights of
third parties) exist prior to the Agreement, establish a list of these pre-existing industrial and
intellectual property rights, specifying the rights owners.
88Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The coordinator must — before starting the action — submit this list to the granting authority.
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic
autonomy reasons, background that is subject to control or other restrictions by a country (or
entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries or target countries set out in
the call conditions and that impact the results (i.e. would make the results subject to control or
restrictions) must not be used and must be explicitly excluded in the list of background —
unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
Results free from restrictions
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic
autonomy reasons, the beneficiaries must ensure that the results of the action are not subject
to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the
eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions — unless otherwise agreed
with the granting authority.
Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them (unless the consortium agreement
specifies another ownership regime).
Protection of results
The beneficiaries must adequately protect their results — for an appropriate period and with
appropriate territorial coverage — if protection is possible and justified, taking into account
all relevant considerations, including the prospects for commercial exploitation, legitimate
interests of the other beneficiaries and any other legitimate interests.
Exploitation of results
Beneficiaries must — up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —
use their best efforts to exploit their results directly or to have them exploited indirectly by
another entity, in particular through transfer or licensing.
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic
autonomy reasons (and unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority), the beneficiaries
must produce a significant amount of products, services or processes that incorporate results
of the action or that are produced through the use of results of the action in the eligible
countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.
Where the call conditions impose moreover a first exploitation obligation, the first
exploitation must also take place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions.
The beneficiaries must ensure that these obligations also apply to their affiliated entities,
associated partners, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties.
Transfers and licensing of results
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic
autonomy reasons, the beneficiaries may not transfer ownership of their results or grant
89Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
licences to third parties which are established in countries which are not eligible countries or
target countries set out in the call conditions (or are controlled by such countries or entities
from such countries) — unless they have requested and received prior approval by the
granting authority.
The request must:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner and the planned or potential exploitation of the
results and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or license on the
security interests or EU strategic autonomy .
The granting authority may request additional information.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under the Agreement are passed on to the
new owner and that this new owner has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent
transfer.
Access rights — Additional rights of use
Rights of use of the granting authority on results for information, communication, publicity
and dissemination purposes
The granting authority also has the right to exploit non-sensitive results of the action for
information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes, using any of the
following modes:
- use for its own purposes (in particular, making them available to persons working for
the granting authority or any other EU service (including institutions, bodies, offices,
agencies, etc.) or EU Member State institution or body; copying or reproducing them
in whole or in part, in unlimited numbers; and communication through press
information services)
- distribution to the public in hard copies, in electronic or digital format, on the
internet including social networks, as a downloadable or non-downloadable file
- editing or redrafting (including shortening, summarising, changing, correcting,
cutting, inserting elements (e.g. meta-data, legends or other graphic, visual, audio or
text elements), extracting parts (e.g. audio or video files), dividing into parts or use in
a compilation)
- translation(including inserting subtitles/dubbing)in all official languages of EU
- storage in paper, electronic or other form
- archiving in line with applicable document-management rules
90Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- the right to authorise third parties to act on its behalf or sub-license to third parties,
including if there is licensed background, any of the rights or modes of exploitation set
out in this provision
- processing, analysing, aggregating the results and producing derivative works
- disseminating the results in widely accessible databases or indexes (such as through
‘open access’ or ‘open data’ portals or similar repositories, whether free of charge or
not).
The beneficiaries must ensure these rights of use for the whole duration they are protected by
industrial or intellectual property rights.
If results are subject to moral rights or third party rights (including intellectual property rights
or rights of natural persons on their image and voice), the beneficiaries must ensure that they
comply with their obligations under this Agreement (in particular, by obtaining the necessary
licences and authorisations from the rights holders concerned).
Access rights for the granting authority and EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies to
results for policy purposes
The beneficiaries must grant access to their results — on a royalty-free basis — to the
granting authority, other EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, for developing,
implementing and monitoring EU policies or programmes.
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
Access rights for the granting authority to results in case of a public emergency
If requested by the granting authority in case of a public emergency, the beneficiaries must
grant non-exclusive, world-wide licences to third parties — under fair and reasonable
conditions — to use the results to address the public emergency.
Access rights for third parties to ensure continuity and interoperability
Where the call conditions impose continuity or interoperability obligations, the beneficiaries
must make the results produced in the framework of the action available to the public (freely
accessible on the Internet under open source licences).
COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY (— ARTICLE 17)
Communication and dissemination plan
The beneficiaries must provide a detailed communication and dissemination plan, setting out
the objectives, key messaging, target audiences, communication channels, social media plan,
planned budget and relevant indicators for monitoring and evaluation.
Dissemination of results
The beneficiaries must disseminate their results as soon as feasible, in a publicly available
format, subject to any restrictions due to the protection of intellectual property, security rules
or legitimate interests.
91Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
They must upload the public project results to the Digital Europe Project Results platform,
available through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
In addition, where the call conditions impose additional dissemination obligations, they must
also comply with those.
Additional communication activities
The beneficiaries must engage in the following additional communication activities:
- present the project (including project summary, coordinator contact details, list of
participants, European flag and funding statement and special logo and project results)
on the beneficiaries’ websites or social media accounts.
SPECIFIC RULES FOR CARRYING OUT THE ACTION (— ARTICLE 18)
Implementation in case of restrictions due to security or EU strategic autonomy
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic
autonomy reasons, the beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as
affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third
parties are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out
in the call conditions (or are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) —
unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation with entities established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or
are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect the security
interests or EU strategic autonomy and avoids potential negative effects over security of
supply of inputs critical to the action.
Specific rules for PAC Grants for Procurement
When implementing innovative procurements in PAC Grants for Procurement, the
beneficiaries must respect the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-
discrimination, equal treatment, sound financial management, proportionality and
competition rules
- assign the ownership of the intellectual property rights under the contracts to the
contractors (unless there are exceptional overriding public interests which are duly
justified in Annex 1), with the right of the buyers to access results — on a royalty-free
basis — for their own use and to grant (or to require the contractors to grant) non-
exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the results for them — under fair and
reasonable conditions — without any right to sub-license
- allow for all communications to be made in English (and any additional languages
chosen by the beneficiaries)
92Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- ensure that prior information notices, contract notices and contract award notices
contain information on the EU funding and a disclaimer that the EU is not
participating as contracting authority in the procurement
- allow for the award of multiple procurement contracts within the same procedure
(multiple sourcing)
- for procurements involving classified information: apply the security rules set out in
Annex 5 mutatis mutandis to the contractors and the background and results of the
contracts
- where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU
strategic autonomy reasons: apply the restrictions set out in Annex 5 mutatis mutandis
to the contractors and the results under the contracts
- where the call conditions impose a place of performance obligation: ensure that the
part of the activities that is subject to the place of performance obligation is performed
in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions
- to ensure reciprocal level of market access: where the WTO Government Procurement
Agreement (GPA) does not apply, ensure that the participation in tendering procedures
is open on equal terms to bidders from EU Member States and all countries with
which the EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement under the
conditions laid down in that agreement, including all Digital Europe associated
countries. Where the WTO GPA applies, ensure that tendering procedures are also
open to bidders from states that have ratified this agreement, under the conditions laid
down therein.
Specific rules for Grants for Financial Support
When implementing financial support to third parties in Grants for Financial Support, the
beneficiaries must respect the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-
discrimination and sound financial management
- for the selection procedure and criteria:
- publish open calls widely (including on the Funding & Tenders Portal and the
beneficiaries’ websites)
- keep open calls open for at least two months
- inform recipients of call updates (if any) and the outcome of the call (list of
selected projects, amounts and names of selected recipients)
Specific rules for JU actions
JU actions must contribute to the long-term implementation of the JU partnership, including
the JU Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, the JU objectives and the exploitation of
research and innovation results.
93Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Moreover, when implementing JU actions, the members and contributing partners of the Joint
Undertaking must fulfil their obligations regarding contributions to the Joint Undertaking:
- the description of the action in Annex 1 must include, for beneficiaries, affiliated
entities, associated partners or other participants or third parties which are members or
contributing partners, the estimated contributions to the action, i.e.:
- in-kind contributions to operational activities (‘IKOP’; if applicable)
- in-kind contributions to additional activities linked to the action (‘IKAA’; if
applicable)
- financial contributions (‘FC’; if applicable)
- the contributions must be reported during the implementation of the action in the
Portal Continuous Reporting tool
- at the end of the action, the members and contributing partners that have not received
funding under the grant must ensure that financial and in-kind contributions of EUR
430 000 or more (see Article 21) are supported by statements of contributions (CS)
and certificates on the statements of contributions (CCS) which fulfil the following
conditions:
- be provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent and
complies with Directive 2006/43/EC (or for public bodies: by a competent
independent public officer)
- the verification must be carried out according to the highest professional

provisions under the Agreement and the applicable JU Regulation, that the
contributions cover activities that are part of the action and that they have not
been reimbursed by the grant
- contributions must comply with the following conditions:
- costs covered by financial contributions cannot be claimed for reimbursement
under the JU grant.
The beneficiaries must comply with the additional IPR, dissemination and exploitation
obligations set out in the call conditions (Article 16 and Annex 5), in particular:
- for all JU grants: the granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing also
applies to results generated by beneficiaries not having received funding under the
grant.
In addition to the obligations set out in Article 17, communication and dissemination
activities as well as infrastructure, equipment or major results funded under JU actions must
moreover display the Joint Undertaking’s special logo:
94Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
and the following text:
“The project is supported by the [insert JU name] and its members [OPTION for actions with national
contribution top-ups: (including top-up funding by [name of the national funding authority])].”
For EuroHPC and Chips JU grants, the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions
when implementing actions with national contribution top-ups from Participating States:
- the beneficiaries must ensure visibility of the national contributions (see below)
- the payment deadlines for prefinancing, interim or final payments are automatically
suspended if a national funding authority is late with its payments to the Joint
Undertaking for the national contribution top-up
- the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), European Public Prosecutor’s Office
(EPPO), European Court of Auditors (ECA), the National Court of Auditors and other
national authorities can exercise their control rights on the project implementation and
costs declared, including for the national contribution top-up.
Specific rules for blending operations
When implementing blending operations, the beneficiaries acknowledge and accept that:
- the grant depends on the approved financing from the Implementing Partner and/or
public or private investors for the project
- they must inform the granting authority both about the approval for financing and the
financial close — within 15 days
- the payment deadline for the first prefinancing is automatically suspended until the
granting authority is informed about the approval for financing
- both actions will be managed and monitored in parallel and in close coordination with
the Implementing Partner, in particular:
- all information, data and documents (including the due diligence by the
Implementing Partner and the signed agreement) may be exchanged and may be
relied on for the management of the other action (if needed)
- issues in one action may impact the other (e.g. suspension or termination in one
action may lead to suspension also of the other action; termination of the grant
will normally suspend and exit from further financing and vice versa, etc.)
95Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: DEP MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- the granting authority may disclose confidential information also to the Implementing
Partner.

1. My Area — User account and roles
Getting access to My Area
The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is the central electronic portal for all EU funding and
tenders.
It is managed by the European Commission and used by itself and other EU services (together
‘EU’) for their grants, prizes and procurements.
The Portal has two parts: A public section with general information (Funding Opportunities,
Reference Documents, etc) and My Area, which is a secured, personalised section (Portal
electronic exchange system) used by the participants for managing their proposals and
grants/contracts.
For security reasons, access to My Area is based on:
• EU Login account — unique identifier for individuals. All you need to open an EU Login
account is your work e-mail address.
• Roles & access rights (Identity and Access Management System — IAM)
• PIC number — unique identifier for organisations. This 9-digit number is received after
you register in the Portal Participant Register.
In My Area you can:
• get access to non-public information on your proposals, projects/contracts,
organisations, etc
• register in the Participant Register and update your organisation/natural person data
• sign contracts, submit reports, cost claims, invoices and receive payments
• communicate with the EU services about your ongoing projects/contracts
• for experts working with the EU services: register, sign contracts, manage tasks, submit
cost claims and receive payments
• for external audit firms working with the EU services: register and manage tasks
Individual users:
• have to register as a user only once
• will be asked to agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions on their first login
• will have specific access rights, depending on their roles in the
organisation/projects/contracts
Organisations:
• will be asked to agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions when they appoint their LEAR.
1.1 EU Login
EU Login provides a single sign-on to a large number of services and tools available on the
Portal.
5EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
To access to the functions available on My Area, you must have an EU Login account.
• To create an EU Login account, you click on the Register button on the Portal homepage;
all you need is your name and work e-mail address.
• If you already have an EU Login account, you must use that one.
EU Login is the new name for the previously used ECAS account (European Commission
Authentication System); old accounts continue to work, there is no need to create new ones.
Creating an EU Login account
Go to the Portal Register page and enter:
• your first name, last name and e-mail address
• the displayed security code.
Select Create an account
You will receive an e-mail to the address that you specified, containing a link you should
use to complete the registration process.
Click the link you will be asked to choose and confirm a password.
Go back to the Portal homepage.
Click on Login and log in with your registered e-mail (user name) address and
password.
Your EU Login password and user name is personal — do NOT share it with colleagues or
anyone else. All transactions made with your account (user name, password) will be considered
as having been made by yourself. Keep your password secure and change it regularly.
Logging in to the Portal with your EU Login account
After logging in, you can use the personalised services and tools available on the Portal.
Your EU Login account gives you only general access to My Area, but it will NOT yet give you
access to project/contract data of your organisation. This access depends on your roles and
access rights.
FAQ
• FAQ on EU Login help page
1.2 Roles and access rights
Roles and access rights restrict the information a user can view and the tasks they can perform
(for instance, only a person with the coordinator role can delete a draft application).
Access rights are linked to a user's roles in the Portal personalised area (My Area), which are
in turn linked to their functions within their organisation or in relation to a particular
project/contract and their nomination by the organisation’s LEAR (or other authorised person).
6EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
How are access rights managed?
Roles are divided into 2 main sections:
• Organisation roles are linked to the whole organisation and its data (but without any
access to the projects/contracts)
• Project/contract roles are defined first in the proposal, and then transferred to the
project/contract when you have been invited to sign with the EU. They are managed
application by application and project by project, covering all types of access
(read/write/submit).
One user can have several roles at the same time.
How are the roles assigned?
Most of these roles can be freely assigned and managed by you or your organisation, according
to your needs:
• you can start creating an application yourself
• you can be invited by other users who have created an application to join their
application
• persons in your organisation can give you (and revoke) access to roles of your
organisation
• the initiator of an application (or persons in your organisation involved in an on-going
application) can give you (and revoke) access to roles in the application
• persons involved in on-going projects/contracts can give you (and revoke) access to
roles in their projects/contracts.
All access rights are linked to the user's EU Login account.
Exceptions
The EU services intervene in the assignment of the following 2 key roles:
LEAR (Legal Entity Appointed Representative) — organisation role
The LEAR is the person that is officially nominated by an organisation to manage rights and
obligations related to the use of the Portal and to act as main administrative and legal contact
in case of issues. Usually, LEARs are staff members in the central administration of the
organisation. The LEAR handles all the organisation-related data on the Portal and appoints the
persons within their organisation that are allowed to electronically sign grants/contracts and
cost claims.
There can only be one LEAR per organisation.
LEARs are validated by the Central Validation Service as part of the registration in the
Participant Register. Learn more about the detailed procedure for appointing the LEAR.
Primary Coordinator Contact — project role
The Main Contact/Contact Point of the Coordinator/Group Leader in the application will become
the PCoCo (Primary Coordinator Contact). This person is by default the one creating the
application in the Portal and thereby becomes the main person responsible for the application.
As such, they can submit requests, reports and notifications to the EU on behalf of the
consortium.
7EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
There can only be one PCoCo per project/contract.
During the application phase and before call deadline, the PCoCo may transfer this role to
someone else in the application.
Afterwards (i.e. after call submission is closed), a new PCoCo can be assigned only by the EU
Project/Procurement Officer. If such a replacement becomes necessary, the Coordinator should
send a request to the Officer via the Portal Messaging Service (My Projects/My Contracts >
Actions > Manage Project/Contract).
Exceptionally — and only until a LEAR has been appointed — self-registrants have certain
roles (that were not assigned to any of the other users listed above).
Roles — Overview
The picture below shows all the roles involved in managing organisations and projects/contracts
in the Portal.
For some funding programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe ERC and MSCA grants), additional roles
are used. See the for more details.
Organisation roles
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
The LEAR is the formally nominated main responsible for an organisation’s use of the Portal and
thus bears the final responsibilty for all the organisation’s actions in the Portal.
LEARs have system rights to:
• update their organisation's data
• nominate/revoke representatives of their organisation to electronically sign
grant/contracts
• nominate/revoke representatives of their organisation to electronically sign cost
claims/invoices
• nominate/revoke Account Administrators within their organisation to help them with
their work.
8EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The LEAR does NOT assign the Legal Signatories and Financial Signatories for a particular
project/contract. This is done by the Coordinator Contact (CoCo) or Participant Contact (PaCo)
of that project/contract.
Self-registrant
The Self-registrant is the person who first registers an organisation in the Portal Participant
Register.
Before the LEAR is validated, Self-registrants can provide the EU with requested information
and documents about their organisation.
Once the LEAR has been formally validated (normally after the organisation has been validated
by the Central Validation Service), the role of Self-registrant is revoked and replaced by the
LEAR.
Account Administrator
The LEAR may delegate tasks to one or more Account Administrators. Though the LEAR keeps
the full responsibility, Account Administrators can fulfil tasks for their LEAR. An organisation
can have an unlimited number of Account Administrators.
If the organisation nominates a new person as their LEAR, the existing Account Administrators
remain, but can be revoked by the new LEAR.
Legal Signatory (LSIGN)
LSIGNs must be nominated for an organisation by the LEAR or an Account Administrator (see
Figure 3).
LSIGNs are assigned to a particular project by a Coordinator or Participant Contact (see Figure
3). An organisation can have an unlimited number of LSIGNs.
Financial Signatory (FSIGN)
FSIGNs must be nominated for an organisation by the LEAR or an Account Administrator (see
Figure 3).
FSIGNs are assigned to a particular project by a Coordinator or Participant Contact (see Figure
3). An organisation can have an unlimited number of FSIGNs.
Primary Audit Contact (PAuCo) and Audit Contact (AuCo)
Audit roles can be assigned in the Portal only when the organisation is audited.
The LEAR is automatically assigned the Primary Audit Contact (PAuCo), and can nominate other
PAuCos in the organisation.
The PAuCo(s) must also nominate at least one Audit Contact (AuCo) as main contact for audits
on the organisation, and additionally, assign both the AuCo and the audit to an audit team
within the organisation.
PAuCos have the following system rights for their organisation:
• nominate other PAuCo(s) for the organisation and the AuCo(s) for an audit (My
Organisations > Actions > View Roles, click the Roles tab). Detailed explanations are
available in the
• manage the teams in the organisation to assign the audits and the audit contacts to
them (My Organisations > Actions > View Roles, click the Teams tab). Detailed
explanations are available in the
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• revoke other roles
AuCos can nominate other AuCos for the teams to which they are assigned. They can also
revoke other AuCos in their team.
An AuCo assigned to a team has the following system rights for those audits:
• perform the audit tasks for their organisation
• communicate with the EU auditors (receive and send formal notifications, submit audit
documents, etc)
Summary organisation roles
When nominating FSIGNs or LSIGNs, the LEAR can add comments that can help the
Participant Contacts to select the right LSIGN/FSIGN for their project (e.g. "Mr Smith can sign
for projects run by Department X from 1 February 2014."). Such comments can be useful for
defining the scope of responsibilities or duration of FSIGNs or LSIGNs in large organisations
with different departments.
Proposal roles
When preparing your proposal, you will need to define the participating organisations and the
organisation/proposal contact(s). Both are set in the application online form.
For grants and prizes: The proposal will contain the following types of participating
organisations:
• Coordinator. A proposal can have only one, and you may submit an application with just
one Coordinator and no other participating organisations. You need to name a
10EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Coordinator immediately to launch your application, but you can change it later on,
before submission.
• Partner. A proposal can have none, one or more. The number of Partners in an
application (and other aspects such as the country where they are registered, etc) are
subject to the call conditions (i.e. the specific requirements for each call for proposals).
• Partners can also have Affiliated Entities linked to them (through a permanent legal or
capital link or as members of an association; former Linked Third Parties). Affiliated
Entities are allowed to fully participate in the grant and claim costs. They must comply
with all eligibility conditions (same as a Partner).
• Associated Partners. This kind of participating organisation contributes to the project
but cannot claim costs. They are normally not linked to any Partner and do not need to
comply with the eligibility conditions.
Then, you will need to define the contact persons for each participating organisation. There are
two possible types of contacts:
• Main Contact. You need to define one per participating organisation.
• Contact Person. You may define one or more Contact Persons for each Partner. You may
further define their kind of access as Coordinator/Participant Contact (full access) or
Team Member (read-only access).
The roles in your proposal will afterwards become project roles:
• The Main Contact of the Coordinator will become the Primary Coordinator Contact
(PCoCo). This role is automatically assigned to the initiator of the application who
submits the proposal to the EU.
• The Main Contacts of the Partners will become Participant Contacts (PaCo).
• The Contact Persons of the Coordinator/Partners will become Team Members (TeMe) if
they had read-only access in the application form or Participating Contacts (PaCo) if
they had full access.
For tenders:
The tender will contain the following types of participating organisations:
• Group Leader. A submission can have only one, and you may submit a tender with just
one Group Leader and no more participating organisations.
• Group Member. A submission can have none, one or more (often none).
In a call for tenders, you need to provide one single contact: Contact Point. One per application.
This Contact is always linked to the Group Leader.
During the submission phase, this is the only role which will be defined. The Contact Point will
then become the Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo).
Project/contract roles
Depending on your project roles you can have read-only, read-write or read-write-submit rights
to information, documents and online forms.
(Primary) Coordinator Contact (PCoCo/CoCo)
The Primary Coordinator Contact is for each project the main contact between the consortium
and the EU for a particular project/contract. By default, it is the person that creates the
application in the Portal.
11EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The PCoCo can nominate/revoke a Coordinator Contact (CoCo) for the project/contract
(unlimited number possible), who will then have the same rights — except the right to revoke
the PCoCo.
All Coordinator Contacts can:
• nominate/revoke Participant Contacts for other organisations in the consortium
• nominate/revoke Task Managers and Team Members in their own organisation
• assign Legal and Financial Signatories in their organisation to their projects
• make changes to project documents on the Portal
• communicate with the EU services and submit applications and project documents to
the EU.
It is important to list your partner organisations (and their contact persons) relatively early
on in the application process, because this will give them access to the application and allow
them to appoint other roles for their organisation.
Participant Contact (PaCo)
The PaCo is a representative of an organisation in the consortium that is not the coordinating
organisation.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of PaCos per project, and each will be able to:
• nominate/revoke other PaCos in their organisation
• assign Legal and Financial Signatories in their organisation to their projects/contracts
• submit their work to the Coordinator
• nominate/revoke Task Managers and Team Members in their own organisation
• make changes specifically to the participant-related sections of the project documents
on the Portal
• submit information directly to the EU services (if required under the Grant Agreement)
Task Manager (TaMa)
TaMas can perform some restricted actions: creating, updating and uploading documents about
their organisation's participation and completing, modifying or deleting project/contract
information.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of TaMas per project. They cannot nominate or
revoke anybody, nor submit information to the Coordinator or EU.
This role is not used during the application phase.
Team Member (TeMe)
TeMes have limited access rights: search and read-only functions.
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN)
The PLSIGN has the right to sign the grant/contract (and amendments) for a specific project on
behalf of the organisation.
12EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint LSIGNs; the Coordinator and each
participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PLSIGNs for a given project to act as legal
signatory for the participant in the project.
An organisation can have can have an unlimited number PLSIGNs per project.
They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot
assign/revoke any roles.
Project Financial Signatory (PFSIGN)
The PFSIGN has the right to sign cost claims/invoices on behalf of the organisation.
The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint FSIGNs; the Coordinator and each
participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PFSIGNs for a given project to act as legal
signatory for the participant in the project.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of PFSIGNs per project.
They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot
assign/revoke any roles.
Summary project/contract roles
Rights associated with roles
13EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Nomination process
Some roles are automatically given based on the information in your application:
• The proposal initiator will become the Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo).
• The main contact persons in the participating organisations will become Participant
Contacts (PaCos).
• Persons with read-only access to the proposal will become Team Members (TeMes).
Once your organisation is validated by the Central Validation Service, it is important that
you appoint a LEAR to make sure that you can manage the access rights to the Portal.
How to nominate/revoke someone
To grant a role, the LEAR (or other authorised person) must enter the user's e-mail address. It
must be the same as the address the person used to open their EU Login account.
If the person does not already have an EU Login account, they will automatically receive an
invitation to create one.
Organisation roles — to grant/revoke, go to My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation
Roles > Add Roles.
Project/contract roles — to grant/revoke, go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Consortium
> Edit Roles.
How many different roles are needed in a consortium?
A user's EU Login account can carry any combination of roles, this depends on the participants.
Thus, a user can acquire a differentiated set of access rights to different functions for managing
projects, contracts or organisation data.
For small organisations or beneficiaries who are individuals (natural persons), this means
that one single person can combine all the access rights needed to manage their
projects/contracts (i.e. LEAR, CoCo/PaCo, PLSIGN and PFSIGN).
The minimum configuration for a consortium in any given project is:
• 1 Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo)
14EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• 1 Participant Contact (PaCo) per beneficiary
• 1 LEAR per organisation
• 1 Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN) per organisation
• 1 Project Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) per organisation.
One person can have several roles at the same time.
Organisations that participate as Affiliated Entities (or other type of participant — Associated
Partner, Subcontractor, etc) do NOT need any access roles in the Portal, since they are not
allowed to use it. All actions in the Portal are handled for them by the Coordinator/Beneficiary
they are linked to.

1.3 Accepting the Terms and Conditions of Use
The Portal is part of the Single Electronic Data Exchange Area set up under Articles 147 and
128 of the EU Financial Regulation.
On the first login to My Area, users must agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions and the
Portal Privacy Statement.
Organisations will be asked to agree to the Terms and Conditions when they appoint their LEAR
(declaration of consent). Every time you access to My Area, you are implicitly reaffirming
your acceptance of the Terms and Conditions valid at that time.
Personal data will be kept and processed for the purposes of the Single Electronic Data Exchange
Area, i.e. for the management and implementation of your EU grants, contracts, prizes and
other transactions managed through the Portal. The detailed conditions for the processing of
your personal data are set out in the Portal Privacy Statement.
2. Participant Register — Register your organisation
15EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If you want to submit a proposal, your organisation needs to be registered in the Portal
Participant Register and have a 9-digit Participant Identification Code (PIC).
If your proposal is successful, you will receive a notification and be asked to:
• provide supporting documents to confirm the administrative and legal information
declared during the registration (legal entity validation)
• appoint a Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR appointment)
• provide supporting documents to verify the financial capacity of your organisation
(financial capacity assessment, if applicable)
• validate the bank account for payments (bank account validation, only for coordinators).
2.1 Registration and validation of your organisation
Before submitting an application, all participants involved in the proposal must first be
registered in the Portal Participant Register and have their 9-digit Participant Identification Code
(PIC number).
You can verify directly on the Portal whether your organisation is already registered and has a
PIC. If not, please proceed with the registration following the instructions on the same page
(the Registration wizard will help you through the process). Once completed, you get the PIC
to be used in your online application form and further correspondence with the EU services.
If you do not have an user account (EU Login), you will first need to create one, before starting
the registration process. If you already have a user account (EU Login), you can log in and
directly start registration.
Please note that the Participant Register is primarily directed at organisations and that not
all of the labels fit for individuals (natural persons). Enter your information as appropriate (e.g.
country of residence instead of country of registration, passport number instead of registration
number, etc).
What you need to register your organisation
To register your organisation, you will need to provide basic administrative and legal
information, in addition to contact details.
Get ready
Since the declared information will be verified against supporting documents later on, it is
useful to have the relevant documents at hand when you complete the registration, to
make sure you fill in everything correctly (legal form, non-profit, public/private, etc).
16EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Check for already existing PIC
In order to avoid creating duplicate PICs, you should first check whether your organisation
(or another department) is already registered in the Portal and use that PIC.
Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Search a PIC > Search a PIC and put in
your organisation data. Check several variants to make sure there is really no entry.
If no PIC is registered, start registration
Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Register your organisation. The
Registration wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process.
Detailed explanations are available in the .
You do not need to complete the registration process in a single session. You can enter some
information, save it and continue later on. To resume your registration, go to My Organisations
> Continue Registration. Incomplete draft registrations are automatically deleted after one
year.
If you create by mistake a new PIC, see below Data updates.
PIC number
After completing a new registration, you will receive the 9-digit Participant Identification
Code (PIC) — to be used in your online application form and further correspondence with the
EU services.
The newly created PIC will be provisional (declared/non-valid status) until it is formally validated
at a later stage.
Nothing else is expected from you after the PIC has been generated, the Central Validation
Service will contact you later, to initiate the validation process.
Validation of your organisation
If your proposal is successful, you will be contacted for the validation of your PIC
registration data.
Validation is needed only for certain types of participants (grants: Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities; procurement: Contractors). It is not needed for Associated Partners, Subcontractors
or other participants.
It will be done by the Central Validation Service which carries out the validation for all EU
services using the Portal.
The Central Validation Service will contact the person who registered the organisation (Self-
registrant) and ask them to:
• upload official supporting documents (via the My Organisations page)
• clarify any details.
The documents that are required will be listed in the notification you receive. You will need to
fill out a legal entity identification form and provide us with an official VAT document,
registration extract, statutes or act of establishment, etc. The detailed list of documents is also
17EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
explained in the Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity
Assessment.
The Central Validation Service will check that your organisation is legally recognised (has legal
personality). If this is not the case (exceptionally this is allowed), you will have to prove that
the representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on the organisation’s behalf
and that the organisation has financial and operational capacity equivalent to that of legal
persons.
The Central Validation Service will also check whether your organisation qualifies for some of
the special legal statuses that are required for some funding programmes (private or public
body, non-profit, international organisation).
The outcome of this process is the validation of your organisation (validated PIC). The Central
Validation Service will send a confirmation message once the process is completed and the PIC
is validated.
Please don’t forget that all communications with the Central Validation Service must take
place through the Participant Register (My Organisations page). Emails and other
communications will NOT be accepted.
Please also note that if you apply for a call with specific eligibility criteria that are not validated
by the Central Validation Service, these will be checked by the responsible EU service managing
the call — in addition to the validation, which means that they may come back to you with
additional questions.
Validation of the organisation is a prerequisite for the LEAR appointment.
Data updates
Updates to the registered organisation data must be requested via the Participant Register (My
Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation):
• by the LEAR (or Account Administrators) for validated entities
• by the Self-registrant if your organisation has not been validated yet.
If your organisation has already a validated PIC and a new one is created by mistake, your
LEAR or Account Administrator should contact the Central Validation Service via the Portal
Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation). The information will be
transferred from the duplicate PIC to the correct PIC and the duplicate flagged.
SME self-assessment
In addition to the standard validation, a SME self-assessment is needed if you apply for a call
where SME status is an eligibility criterion (or allows for a higher funding rate or other
advantages).
If there is no recent (not older than 2 years) SME self-assessment information available in the
Participant Register, the Portal Submission System will automatically prompt you to go through
the SME self-assessment wizard to establish your SME status. You will need to enter the
financial figures of the last approved accounting period of your organisation and of any other
organisation that might be directly or indirectly related to you. If the result confirms your SME
status, you will be able to proceed with the application process.
Please note that the SME self-assessment is only needed if the SME-status is an eligibility
criterion (or gives special advantages); otherwise, you will simply self-declare your SME status
in the Legal Information tab and proceed with the registration.Detailed rules are explained in
the Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment.

2.2 LEAR appointment and validation
Parallel to the validation of your organisation, you will be requested by the Central Validation
Service to appoint your Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR).
This must be done by a legal representative of your organisation with the necessary legal
authority to commit the organisation for this type of decisions (e.g. typically CEOs, rectors,
Director-Generals, etc... always in accordance with the statutes of your organisation). If
such decisions are normally reserved for joint decision-making by several representatives, the
appointment must be done together (documents signed by all).
The LEAR role, which can be performed by any member of the organisation (typically from the
central administration), is key. They are formally nominated to manage your organisation’s use
of the Portal and thus bear the final responsibilty for all your actions in the Portal. Once
validated, they will be responsible for:
• keeping an overview of all the proposals/projects/contracts your organisation is involved
in
• managing all the legal and financial information about your organisation
• managing the access rights at organisation-level (and read-only access at project-level)
• appointing the persons which will be able to electronically sign grants/contracts (Legal
Signatories — LSIGNs) and cost claims/invoices (Financial Signatories — FSIGNs).
Applicants that are natural persons do not need to prove their capacity to become a LEAR, but
still need to enter their LEAR data and submit supporting documents.
Further details about the LEAR's rights and responsibilities are explained in the Roles and access
rights section.
Appointing and validation of your LEAR
Please note that registration and validation of your organisation is a prerequisite for the
validation of your LEAR.
Identify the person in your organisation who will act as LEAR and the legal
representative who will appoint them
The person who initially registered the organisation in the Participant Register (the Self-
registrant) will receive the notification from the Central Validation Service to launch the
LEAR appointment procedure.
Encode in the Participant Register the name and contact information of the
LEAR and the legal representative appointing them
19EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
To do so, the Self-registrant must go to My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation.
The Participant Register will, then, generate the necessary documents to be signed:
• LEAR appointment letter and LEAR role and duties (generated as a single document)
• declaration of consent to the Portal Terms & Conditions.
The system will automatically check the existence of an EU Login account for the LEAR (e-
mail address, first and last name). In case of inconsistencies, the system alerts the Self-
registrant. If no EU Login account exists, the system will start creating one and the LEAR
will be requested (via a notification e-mail) to finalise it. The LEAR appointment process
will be blocked until this is done.
Get your organisation's legal representative to:
• date, sign and stamp the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR roles and duties
document generated by the system ( both sections must be signed)
• read the Portal Terms and Conditions and
• date, sign and stamp the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions.
Upload the following documents in the Participant Register:
• the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR role and duties (dated and signed by the legal
representative and the LEAR)
• the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions (dated and signed by
the legal representative)
• copies of an official valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport) with a photo and
signature of:
the legal representative and
o
the appointed LEAR
o
• documents proving the authority of the legal representative; these documents
must:
clearly indicate the person’s role/function within the organisation as legal
o
representative
identify and appoint the individual (by name) as the person covering that
o
specific role/function.
Don't forget that you MUST keep the originals of all documents you uploaded, so that
they are available in case of EU controls, checks or audits. Since your registration in the
Participant Register is valid for this and any future EU funding and tenders procedures your
organisation will ever apply for, the originals must be kept permanently, as long as you are
registered in the Portal (and possibly beyond, for controls, checks and audits, etc). You
should therefore NOT throw them away and ensure that they are maintained also in case
of insolvency, takeover or change of control.
Validation of the LEAR appointment by the Central Validation Service
20EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
After receiving the above-listed documents and once the corresponding PIC has been
validated, the Central Validation Service will also validate the LEAR appointment in the
Participant Register.
Activate the LEAR's online user account
After validation, the LEAR account (with the special access rights) can be be activated by:
• following the instructions the LEAR receives by e-mail
• using the account activation PIN code which will be sent to the LEAR by post, or
by SMS if the LEAR's mobile phone number was provided
Should you encounter any problems with the LEAR appointment, please contact the Central
Validation Service via the Portal Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions> Modify
Organisation).
Data updates — Changing the LEAR
If you need to replace an already validated LEAR, you can designate a new LEAR by making a
new appointment (same steps as initial appointment).
If you are a LEAR and your e-mail address has changed, please inform the Central Validation
Service via the Portal Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation),
in order to obtain instructions on how to proceed for the change.
How can you contact the LEAR?
For contacting LEARs of other organisations, go to How to participate > Participant Register >
Search a PIC to find the organisation. Then, select Actions > Contact Organisation. This will
launch a contact form that allows you to send a message to the LEAR (and their Account
Administrators). The LEAR can then contact you directly.
To contact your own LEAR, log in and then go to My Organisations > Actions > Contact
Organisation.

2.3 Bank account registration and validation
Registration and validation of the bank account for payments
In addition to the validation of the participating organisations, we also have to validate the bank
account that will be used for our payments to you (usually bank account of the Coordinator).
The Central Validation Service will contact the Coordinator after the PIC is validated, to enter
the bank account details into the Participant Register and upload the necessary supporting
documents (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you will need
to provide the bank account details and either a bank statement or financial identification form.
21EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The Central Validation Service will cross-check this information and validate the account.When
registering your organisation for the first time, you do not need to declare any bank account
information. You will be prompted to do this only later on, if your proposal is successful.
Data updates
If you need to change an already validated bank account, please declare the new bank account
details via the Participant Register and upload the required supporting documents.
Please note that it can happen that not all types of modifications are supported. In case of an
issue, please contact the IT Helpdesk.
2.4 Financial capacity assessment
Assessment of your financial capacity
For some participants, we will also have to check the financial capacity before awarding
grants/contracts.
For grants, the criteria for checking financial capacity are set out in the call conditions.
Normally, the financial capacity assessment will be done for all Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities, except:
− public bodies (entities established as public body under national law, including local,
regional or national authorities) or international organisations
− if the individual requested grant amount is EUR 60 000 or below.
Specific rules apply for some programmes (i.e. only for coordinators; only for grants above a
certain threshold; State guarantee; see Horizon Europe Programme Guide, Erasmus+
Programme Guide).
The Central Validation Service will contact you during grant preparation to upload the necessary
financial documents (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you will need
to provide documents showing your financial situation for the last two closed financial years
(profit and loss account and balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an approved
external auditor, certifying the accounts for the last closed financial year, etc).
The analysis is based on neutral financial indicators (liquidity, financial autonomy, solvency and
profitability), but will also take into account other aspects, such as dependency on EU funding
and deficit and revenue in previous years. The results of your financial capacity assessment will
be taken into account when evaluating your ability to implement the project (and to take on
the Coordinator role, if it is the case).
If we consider that your financial capacity is not satisfactory, we may require:
– an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several liabiliy for all
Beneficiaries or joint and several liability of Affiliated Entities
– prefinancing paid in instalments (multiple/additional prefinancing)
– (one or more) prefinancing guarantees
or
– propose no prefinancing or
– request that you are replaced or, if needed, reject the entire application.
22EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Specific rules apply to programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM, former Participant
Guarantee Fund; e.g. Horizon Europe). For these programmes, prefinancing guarantees and
joint and several liability of Beneficiaries are normally excluded.
Financial capacity self-check
You can check your financial capacity yourself by using the Financial capacity self-check
simulator.
The self-check is not available for all programmes (because of the algorithms used).
Moreover, it is only a simulation. If a formal financial capacity assessment is required, you will
have to go through the formal procedure.

• Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment
2.5 Data updates
Who can update the online information about your organisation?
• Initially, only the person who first registered the organisation or any other appointed
Self-registrant
• once appointed, only the appointed representative (LEAR) and appointed Account
Administrators.
To change the information on your organisation, go to My Organisations > Actions > Modify
Organisation.
Please upload legal/financial supporting documents for any updates you submit so that the
Central Validation Service can validate them. Maximum size for uploads: 6MB per file
Changes of legal status
If your organisation changes status or address, your LEAR should immediately update the
information in the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation) and,
if possible, directly inform (via your Coordinator) your EU Project Officers in ongoing grants
(Coordinator uses the Portal Messaging Facility: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Process communications > New message).
Some changes like, for instance, partial or universal transfers of rights will moreover require
amendments in case you have ongoing Grant Agreements/Procurement Contracts.
Managing roles in the organisation
If organisation roles need to be changed, your LEAR should immediately update them in the
system (My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation Roles)
If project/contract roles need to be changed, your CoCo/PaCo should immediately update them
in the system (My Projects > Actions > Project Consortium).
If grants/contracts or cost claims/invoices are signed in the system by persons whose access
rights should have been revoked, this will be your responsibility and you will have to bear the
consequences. Their signatures and other actions will be considered valid by the EU services.

2.6 Complaints about validation
If you believe that a validation result is flawed, you can submit a complaint (following the
deadline and procedure set out in the message on the validation result).
Generally, the means of redress are the following:
• request for validation review — within 30 days of receiving the message
• request for review of legality under Article 22 of Regulation 58/2003 — within 1 month
of receiving the message (using the Article 22 complaints form template)
• action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU — within 2 months of receiving the
message.
You are free to choose any of the above means of redress. However, in the interest of good
administration and procedural efficiency, it is recommended to use first the available
administrative review procedures (if any). The objective of these procedures is to re-examine
the circumstances of the validation procedure and to reach a final decision on your registration.
Deadlines for further redress will therefore run as from when you receive our reply with the
final position.
Please note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending are
considered to have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from opening/access (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
When filing a complaint, please take into account that the formal decision was taken by the
Central Validation Service hosted in the REA executive agency, and that complaints must
therefore be directed against that agency (NOT against the European Commission).
In case you consider that there has been maladministration on the part of the Central Validation
Service, you can also address a complaint to the European Ombudsman — within 2 years after
you became aware of it AND after having used all the means of administrative redress available
(validation review and Article 22 request).

You can access calls and topics in your area of interest through the Portal Search funding &
tenders page. This page allows you to search in the text of the call and topic titles, call and
topic identifiers, topic description and keywords and tags. You can also filter using the quick
search per topics related to specific EU priorities.
If you would like to receive updates on new calls, you can subscribe to the Funding Opportunities
RSS feed.
The Search funding & tenders page also hosts calls for tenders (EU procurements) and prizes.
It does NOT cover financial instruments (EU loans and venture capital) — these are normally
managed through financial partners (banks), but the Portal homepage has a direct link to the
Access to finance page on Europa.
Calls and topics
On the Portal most calls are divided into topics.
Call — Group of topics that are open in parallel and address the same policy domain.
Topic — Part of a call with one opening and closing date. The proposals submitted to the topic
will be evaluated together and compete against each other.
The Search funding & tenders page will display the list of open topics; the name of the call they
belong to is visible on the Topic page.
The Topic page contains all the information you need to have for your proposal (call conditions,
legal framework and key documents, standard application form and other practical information
you need to prepare your proposal). The Topic page also specifies the call deadline and contains
a link to the Portal Submission System, through which you can submit your proposal. The
Topic page also contains call and topic updates (changes or important information for the
applicants).
Deadline for submission
A topic is considered open until the deadline for submission has passed (call deadline).
Each topic will specify deadlines and/or cut-off dates.
Deadline models
Single-stage
For most topics, you must submit a full proposal by the call deadline.
Two-stage
26EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Some topics have a 2-stage submission procedure, which means that you have to submit a
short outline proposal for stage 1 and then a full proposal only if you are invited to stage 2
(meaning that your project looks promising).
Multiple cut-off
Some topics are continuously open, where you can submit a proposal at any time, and cut-
off dates mean that all proposals received by a given cut-off date will be evaluated after that
deadline.
Types of action
Types of action designate funding schemes, i.e. calls with the same characteristics: policy
domain (scope of funded activities), award criteria, reimbursement rate and in some cases form
of funding (budget-based grant, lump sum grant, unit grant, prize, procurement, debt and
equity facility, etc).
The types of action depend on each EU programme.
There are two main types: action grants (for projects) and operating grants (to support
organisations and their running costs).
In addition, most programmes distinguish the following:
• Project Grants
• Lump Sum Grants
• Unit Grants and
• Framework Partnerships.
However, especially larger programmes have developed their own specific set of types of action,
for instance:
• Horizon Europe: Research and Innovation Actions, Innovation Actions, Coordination and
Support Actions, Pre-commercial Procurements, Public Procurement of Innovative
Solutions, etc
• Digital Europe: Simple Grants, Coordination and Support Actions, SME Support Actions,
Grants for Financial Support, Grants for Procurement, PAC Grants for Procurement,
Lump Sum Grants, Framework Partnerships
• CEF: Project Grants, Infrastructure Projects, Lump Sum Grants, Unit Grants, Framework
Partnerships
• Single Market Programme: Project Grants, Lump Sum Grants, Grants for Financial
Support, PPI Grants for Procurement, Framework Partnerships, European Statistics, etc.
Within the types of actions, EU grants fund all kinds of activities (collaborative actions,
coordination and networking actions, coordination and support actions, support to
organisations, technical assistance and capacity building actions, mobility actions, cofund
actions to existing grant schemes/procurements of the beneficiaries, infrastructure actions,
etc).
Technology readiness levels (TRL)
Calls in the field of innovation (close to market) often use the notion of technology readiness
level to specify also the level of technology readiness that is expected from the projects. There
are 9 technology readiness levels:
27EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• TRL 1 — basic principles observed
• TRL 2 — technology concept formulated
• TRL 3 — experimental proof of concept
• TRL 4 — technology validated in lab
• TRL 5 — technology validated in relevant environment
• TRL 6 — technology demonstrated in relevant environment
• TRL 7 — system prototype demonstration in operational environment
• TRL 8 — system complete and qualified
• TRL 9 — actual system proven in operational environment.
3.1.2 Projects that can be funded — Conditions for funding
The types of projects and activities that can be funded are set out for each call in the call
conditions on the Topic page.
The other conditions (eligibility of participants, admissibility requirements, exclusion grounds,
operational and financial capacity requirements, award criteria, etc) are also explained on the
Topic page.
Please note that for some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe, EDF and AMIF), projects may
need to undergo additional checks and procedures before funding can be awarded, such as
specific ethics review, security scrutiny, third country control check, etc.
3.1.3 Apply with partners or as individual
Who can apply?
To see whether your organisation is eligible for funding, check the call conditions on the Topic
page.
In general, most EU funding programmes require that participants (Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities) are:
• legal entities (public or private bodies, including international organisations)
and
• established in one of the eligible countries, i.e.:
EU Member State (including EU overseas countries and territories (OCTs))
o
eligible non-EU countries:
o
EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway — if opted-in for the
o
programme)
associated countries (countries associated to the funding programme by
o
paying a contribution — list differs for each programme).
Please be aware, however, that almost all programmes have additional criteria, which
widen or narrow the group of entities that can apply. Some programmes are open to participants
from the entire world (e.g. Horizon Europe) others are deliberately restricted to EU countries
only (e.g. EDF). In addition, the situation can be different from call to call even within a
programme. It is therefore very important to carefully look at the call conditions.
Moreover, participants must be registered in the Participant Register (mandatory for
Beneficiaries, Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners) and be validated by the Central
28EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Validation Service by the time the grant is signed (mandatory for Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities).
Multi-participant or mono-participant actions
Most of the calls for EU grants target multi-beneficiary consortia made up of participants from
different countries — to enhance the EU added value, promote cooperation between
organisations in different countries, reinforce the quality of applications and ensure fair
competition and equal opportunities throughout the EU.
Some programmes formalise this, by adding specific requirements for the consortium
composition (e.g. Horizon Europe, UCPM, etc).
To see whether a call requires minimum consortium composition, check the call conditions on
the Topic page.
How to find partners for your project ideas?
To find partners for your project ideas, you can:
• Use the Partner Search function of the Portal. The function allows to:
look for organisations which received funding in the past
o
create and check Partner Search requests by call/topic
o
• Use other Partner Search tools and services. A list of recommended support sites is
offered under the Helpdesks & Support Services page.
• Participate in conferences, brokerage events organised by the EU or networks in the
Member States (National Contact Points or Desks, Enterprise Europe Network, etc).
Portal Partner Search
If you want to find experienced partners who already have ongoing projects, or if you want to
browse in the database of registered organisations, visit the Partner Search page. You can
search by keyword/geographical area/funding type, etc. Search results include complete
organisation profiles with lists of funded projects and the possibility to contact representatives.
If you have selected your area of interest via the Topic search, you may publish your
offer/interest for one or more of the open/forthcoming topics of a call on the Portal. All your
published offers/interests will be visible on your organisation's page too.
Enterprise Europe Network Cooperation Opportunities Database — The Enterprise Europe
Network (EEN) publishes an extensive number of innovation and technology profiles from
international companies and research organisations to help identify suitable partners for
bilateral business, innovation and technology cooperation. The EEN database is updated with
new profiles on a weekly basis. All profiles are published anonymously. Express your interest in
collaboration by filling in and sending the Expression of Interest form to your local EEN office,
who will establish the contact.
Consortium roles and responsibilities
When setting up your grant consortium, you should think of organisations that help you reach
objectives and solve problems.
29EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Beneficiaries — Affiliated Entities — Associated Partners —
Subcontractors
The roles should be attributed according to the level of participation in the project. Main
participants should participate as Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities (former Linked Third
Parties); other entities can participate as Associated Partners, Subcontractors, Third parties
giving in-kind contributions, etc.
Associated Partners and Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not get any part
of the grant money and will therefore have to organise other funding sources (bear their own
costs, internal reallocation of funding inside the consortium, find investors, etc).
Subcontracting should normally constitute a limited part of the project and will need to
be justified (give reasons). Tasks may NOT be subcontracted inside the consortium (between
Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities).
Coordinator — Other Beneficiaries
The Coordinator is responsible for managing the project, submitting reports and deliverables
and acting as intermediary for all contacts with the EU Granting Authority.
The other Beneficiaries must implement their part of the project and contribute to the grant
administration (preparing the grant, reporting, etc).
The consortium participants will be jointly responsible for implementing the project activities
(in accordance with their proposal/description of the action). If a project is not finished (or badly
implemented), the grant money may have to be reduced for everyone.
3.1.4 Submit a proposal — Portal Submission System
Proposal submission
Proposals must be submitted electronically using the Portal Submission System.
Where? Access to the Submission System is available through the Topic page on the Portal>
Start Submission.
Who? Proposals must be created and submitted by a contact person of the coordinating
organisation. Exceptions exist for some programmes/types of action which are fully focused on
individuals (e.g. the Principal Investigator in Horizon Europe ERC grants or the Fellow in Horizon
Europe MSCA grants).
How? The Submission wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process. You will need
to use the online forms and templates available in the Submission System. The application form
is described below.
Submission process
Get prepared: Finding your topic > Find partners > Plan your work and budget
Electronic proposal submission: Get an EU Login account > Get a PIC number (Participant
Register) > Launch Submission wizard > Pre-register your draft proposal > List participants,
contact persons > Fill in Administrative Forms (Part A) > Upload Technical Description (Part B)
> Submit your proposal > Acknowledgement of receipt
Application form (Part A and B)
30EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Proposals are submitted using the application forms available in the Submission System. The
application form is structured in into two parts, Parts A and B:
• Part A: contains the structured Administrative Forms with data on the participants, legal
declarations and contact persons (retrieved from the Submission System screens). It
may also include some programme-specific questions.
• Part B (the narrative part): Technical Description of the project with the planned
activities, work packages, costs, etc (must be uploaded as PDF).
Part A is generated while entering the data into the Submission System; Part B needs to be
prepared in advance (using the template downloaded from the system; do NOT use the standard
template from the Topic page).
Part B will also include annexes and supporting documents if required by the call conditions
(detailed budget table, declarations from national authorities, CVs, annual activity reports, etc).
All participants can contribute to the parts, but it is the person from the coordinating
organisation who created the application who must finalise and submit the application.
For programmes with specific security requirements, special instructions may apply (e.g. for
EDF, documents must be uploaded through a password-word protected zip file). For such
programmes, detailed instructions will be available in the call documentation.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Mandate: Make sure that you have the mandate of all participants to submit the
application (explicit agreement to participate).
• Quality check:
Check that the application is coherent and that Part A and B are consistent (especially
budgetary information).
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed; make
sure that no annexes are missing.
Confidentiality
EU services will treat your proposal confidentially, as well as any related information, data
and documents received.
Our evaluators (both in-house and outside experts, if any) are also bound by an obligation of
confidentiality.
Please do NOT discuss your proposal with persons that might act as expert evaluator for us
or be otherwise involved in the evaluation, since this could lead to a conflict of interest with
adverse consequences both for you and the concerned person.
Security, data protection and document retention
Your proposal and all the information received from you will be stored under secure conditions
at all times. The Portal is a closed, secured platform with multiple safeguards.
After the evaluation, we will keep the proposals for audit trail purposes (at least 5 years for
unsuccessful proposals and 10 years after project end for successful proposals and, possibly,
longer if needed for controls, checks and audit purposes).
Personal data will be handled according to the standards set out in Regulation No 2018/1725
and in line with the Portal Privacy Statement.
31EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please be aware that your proposal MUST NOT contain any classified information (Decision
2015/444 or national rules).
Access to proposals
The proposals will remain sealed and closed until after the call deadline.
However, in order to plan the evaluation process (organise translations, evaluation capacities,
evaluators with specialist knowledge, etc) we will ask you for permission to access to certain
information already before:
• call title and topic for which the proposal is submitted
• title of your application, proposal abstract, keywords
• PICs of the participating organisations
• relevant panel (for proposals submitted to specific panels, e.g. Horizon Europe MSCA,
UCPM).
A warning will inform you that the Granting Authority will be accessing this information and
will give you the opportunity to refuse access.

3.1.4.1 Get prepared
Before you can start completing your application, you should study the call documentation,
select partners and plan your project.
Study the call documentation
Choose your topic, and then read carefully the related documents and standard
templates that are available on the Topic page.
The Submission System will check some basic admissibility and eligibility requirements,
but NOT all of them. It is therefore very important that you carefully read the call
conditions. Please note that whenever there is a contradiction between the IT checks in
place and the call documentation, the call documentation prevails.
Select your partners for the project
Most calls require several participants in the proposal (see call conditions on the Topic
page).
You can use the Portal Partner Search to find partners. Other partner search tools are
explained in the Helpdesk & Support Services page.
Plan your project and prepare the Technical Description (Part B)
Planning of the work (work packages, deliverables, milestones)
32EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Look at the call conditions, award criteria and standard application form (Technical
Description (Part B)) on the Topic page.
For most types of action the Technical Description must give a detailed description of the
project idea and work plan (work packages, milestones and deliverables, division of
responsibilities and resources, time schedule, project management structure,
dissemination and communication activities).
Work packages
All project activities should be grouped in a logical, consistent and structured way into
separate work packages. All work packages must present a clear, logical link to the
project objectives and to the other work packages. Ideally, each work package should
constitute a sub-part of the project, a step leading to the achievement of the project’s
overall goals.
Projects should normally have at least 2 work packages:
− work package 1 — management and coordination activities
− work package 2 — outputs related to the project goals.
Beyond that, create only as many as you need (as many as necessary, as few as
possible).
Work package 1 should normally cover all activities related to the general management
and coordination of the project and any activities that do not relate to any of the work
packages leading to a specific result, but which are directly linked to the project as a whole.
For the other work packages, describe the:
• objective(s)
• activities to be implemented — in specific terms
• (tangible and intangible) outputs to be produced.
Milestones & deliverables (if required)
Concerning the outputs:
1. Distinguish between milestones and deliverables:
− milestones: control points in the project that help to chart progress (kick-
off meetings, steering committes, first-draft of a survey, prototype, etc)
− deliverables: outputs to be submitted to the EU (publication, leaflet,
progress report, brochure, list, etc)
2. Be as specific as possible, e.g.:
− events — the number of events, title, content, duration, number of
participants, etc.
− publications — number of pages, language, format (printed/electronic),
number of printed copies (in each language), etc.
3. Be realistic about what you can achieve within the project duration. The scope of
your project should be large enough to make a difference, but it doesn't need to produce
an excessively high number of outputs.
4. Refer only to major outputs. Do NOT include minor sub-items, internal working
papers, meeting minutes, etc. Adapt the number of deliverables to the size of your
33EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
project and work packages (use as many as necessary, as few as possible). You may
be asked to reduce or increase the number during grant preparation.
Budget
Look at the budget table in the Administrative Forms (Part A) in the Submission System.
Only the white cells need to be filled in (the grey cells are not applicable or automatically
filled by the system).
Cross-check with Part B to see if you will also need to submit a detailed budget table or
outline budgetary details also in Part B.
The budget categories to be used for the call are set out in the call conditions and explained
in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
The budgeted costs should be based on a detailed and accurate estimation of your
estimated project costs (based on the cost eligibility rules set out in the Grant Agreement).
They should include all your estimated costs (those of your Affiliated Entities should be
presented separately, for each participating entity).
Keep your estimates on file — you may be required to produce them later on.
Annexes & supporting documents
If required by the call conditions, you will need to prepare additional annexes and
supporting documents (consortium description, declarations by the national authorities,
CVs, annual activity reports, etc).
Use the templates provided inside the Submission System (NOT the ones on the Topic
page).
Detailed budget table (if required)
Many programmes require the submission of a detailed budget table (templates are usually
in format .xlsx or .xlxm).
Simple .xlsx files can simply be filled-in, merged and uploaded. For .xlsm files, you can
usually — after the table has been filled-in and completed using the macro-support — save
a copy as .xlsx and use that copy for merging and uploading the file.
If you are asked to merge and upload a table as PDF (usually for needed for GAP), please
proceed as follows:
Sheets per participant must be filled in for each Beneficiary/Affiliated Entity; sheets for
the entire project must be filled in by the Coordinator — after having received all the
information by the other participants.
Combine into a single PDF:
1. Save participant sheets into one PDF per Beneficiary/Affiliated Entity (choose
sheets via ‘Options’ when saving as PDF)
2. Save participant sheets and project sheets into a PDF for the Coordinator.
3. Combine into a single PDF for upload (using Adobe Acrobat or the Preview App
on Apple Macs).
4. Upload in the system.
CVs (if required)
Provide CVs for the core project team (these are the key staff you have listed in part B and
may include outside experts, if key to your proposal).
34EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
You can submit CVs in any format. If standard CVs are required in the call conditions we
strongly recommend you to use the Europass format. If short outlines are requested, there
are no specific formatting requirements (but please keep the information on each person
to name, birthdate and 1-2 paragraphs describing studies and most relevant work
experience).
As far as possible, upload them in a single PDF file, rather than individually.
If you are still recruiting, please provide the job profile.
Activity report of last year (if required)
This report should describe your organisation's activities for the last year.
It should be detailed enough to allow us to check your organisation’s aims and activities
and its operational and professional capacity.
No finalised annual report yet? Submit the draft version, certified by your organisation's
legal representative.
No report of this type available? Create one for this application and have it certified by your
legal representative.
Online versions — If your report is available on your website, you can just provide a link
(directly to the document(s), not simply to the homepage) and indicate the link on a
separate sheet and upload it as annex (PDF format).
3.1.4.2 Electronic proposal submission
Electronic proposal submission: Get an EU Login account > Get a PIC number (Participant
Register) > Launch Submission wizard > Pre-register your draft proposal > List participants,
contact persons > Fill in Administrative Forms (Part A) > Upload Technical Description (Part B)
> Submit your proposal > Acknowledgement of receipt
Proposals must be submitted online using the Portal Submission System and before the call
deadline.
Details are explained in the .
Actions to be completed before submission
Create your user account to login to the Portal
To be able to submit a proposal, you must first register on the Portal for an EU Login account.
Make sure all participants are registered (PIC)
All participants (Beneficiaries, Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners) must be
registered in the Participant Register and have their 9-digit Participant Identification Code
(PIC). The Coordinator has to be identified with its PIC number at Step 3 of the Submission
wizard, while other participants at Step 4.
Read more about registration and PIC search in the Registration and validation of your
organisation section.
Submitting the application
35EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The Submission wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process.
Detailed explanations are available in the .
Do not forget to check the system requirements for using the Submission System.
Launch the Submission wizard and enter information for the Administrative
Forms (application form (Part A))
Go to the topic on the Search funding & tenders page > Start Submission.
Upload Part B (Technical Description) and annexes and supporting documents
Part B (and the annexes and supporting documents) can be uploaded in Step 5 of the
wizard. Detailed instructions for preparing these documents are available in the section Get
prepared.
Tips
Do not wait until the end to submit
It is highly recommended to submit your proposalas early as possible and at least 48 hours
before the deadline. This will avoid technical problems (system requirements, local
configuration settings, system congestion, etc).
Please note that you can submit the proposal as many times as you want. Every submitted
version will replace the previous one. Your proposal is sealed and closed. It will not be accessed
before the deadline of the call. There is no reason to delay submission for fear of disclosure.
Affiliated entities
In Step 4 of the wizard you specify the organisations participating in the consortium. As from
2021, this will include Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners. They will therefore need to
have registered beforehand and have their PIC. Their budget will also have to be individualised
already at application stage (separate row in the budget table).
Access rights of individual contact persons
In Step 4 of the wizard you also specify the contact persons for the organisations. To read more
about the levels of access rights, see the Roles and access rights section.
Changes to organisation-related data during proposal preparation
If your organisation is already registered, but organisation-related data has changed during
proposal preparation, you cannot update it directly in the Submission System.
The update must first be requested via the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions >
Modify Organisation):
• by the LEAR (or Account Administrators) for validated entities
• by the Self-registrant if your organisation has not been validated yet.
Page limits and formatting requirements for the Technical Description (Part B)
Don’t forget that applications may have mandatory page limits and formatting requirements
(indicated at the beginning of the application form). Excess pages will be automatically made
invisible, and will not be taken into consideration by the evaluators.
36EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Checklist for submission
Before submitting the proposal, check that:
• your proposal fulfils the call conditions
• the proposal (both the Administrative Forms (Part A) and Technical Description (Part
B)) is complete, readable, accessible and printable
• the requested declarations have been made
• all consortium members have:
obtained a user account to log in to the Portal
o
registered in the Participant Register.
o
Mock evaluation
For some programmes, you can find standard evaluation forms similar to those used by our
evaluators on Portal Reference Documents. Try them out. Ideally, ask a disinterested colleague
to carry out a mock evaluation.
Multiple versions of proposal
You can submit your proposal several times before the deadline, to make updates or changes.
To view or change your submitted proposal, go to My Proposals > View Submitted > Re-edit
proposal. As long as the call has not been closed, the newly submitted version will overwrite
the previous one.
Please note that the re-edit functionality is not available for continuously open calls.
Multiple proposals
If the Coordinator submits a number of similar proposals, the Granting Authority may ask them
to choose one or more of them to be withdrawn.
Specific submission schemes
Two-stage submission schemes — You must submit a short outline proposal for stage 1 and will
be invited to submit a full application only if you pass to stage 2. The full application must be
consistent with the short outline proposal (no substantial differences allowed).
Calls with multiple cut-off dates — The call has a final closure date (usually the end of the
funding programme) and several cut-off dates that trigger evaluation. There is an evaluation
session after each cut-off date and the final closure date (normally within a month). After each
cut-off date, the submitted proposals are grouped, reviewed and ranked together. Evaluation
results are made available and proposals invited for grant preparation. If you miss a cut-off
date, the proposal will be evaluated with the next batch in the next evaluation session.
After submission
At submission, the application package is combined into one document, sealed and an e-receipt
is generated (with date and time of submission).
All contact persons of the coordinating organisation will receive an e-mail (after each submission
if several). If you have not received this e-mail, the application has not been submitted.
Please try again or contact the IT Helpdesk.
After the submission, there is normally no further contact between you and us until after the
end of the evaluation. The competent EU service will contact you only if there is a need to clarify
issues or request additional information or if the call foresees a hearing/interview as part of the
evaluation procedure.
37EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Withdrawal of submitted proposals
Before the call deadline, a proposal can be withdrawn at Step 6 of the wizard (My Proposals >
View Submitted > Withdraw proposal). After the call deadline, withdrawal has to be requested
via the IT Helpdesk.
Once withdrawn, the new status will be shown on the My Proposals page (and you can delete
the application with the Delete button).
After the call deadline
Once the call deadline has passed, no further corrections or re-submissions are possible.
However, you can have read-only access to the submitted proposal (My Proposals > View
Submitted).
Proposals that were never submitted (remain in draft status) are accessible for 90 days after
the call deadline (My Proposals > View Draft).
3.1.5 Complaints about failed submission
If you think that submission of your proposal failed and this was due to a technical error on the
Portal side, you may lodge a complaint through the IT Helpdesk.
The complaint must be filed within 4 calendar days after call closure. You will receive an
acknowledgement of receipt the same or next working day.
What else to do? You should secure a PDF version of the part B and annexes of your application
holding a time stamp before the call deadline (file attributes listing the date and time of creation
and last modification), as well as proof of the alleged failure (screenshots). You may be
requested by the IT Helpdesk to provide these items.
EC services will check the IT logs (application log files and access log files of the Commission
IT systems involved) and see if they show a technical problem on the Portal side which
prevented you from submitting (or resubmitting) the proposal.
You will be notified about the outcome as soon as possible.
If your complaint is justified, the files you provided to the IT Helpdesk will be used as your
proposal and sent for evaluation. If you didn’t provide any files, the last version recorded in the
IT system will be used.

• Proposal Submission System: User Manual
3.2 Selection — From evaluation to grant signature
3.2.1 Admissibility and eligibility check
Once you have submitted a proposal, the Granting Authority will check:
• admissibility (complete and properly put together) and
• eligibility (fulfills eligibility conditions)
and then
• ask an independent evaluation committee to evaluate it.
38EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Admissibility criteria
The admissibility conditions are set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.
They are generally the same across all EU programmes. The proposal must:
• be submitted through the online Submission System before the call deadline
• be complete — application form correctly filled out, all sections of Parts A and B
completed, all annexes and supporting documents provided
• be readable, accessible and printable.
Furthermore, the proposal should respect the page limit set out in the application form. Excess
pages will be automatically made illegible, and will not be taken into consideration by the
evaluators.
Eligibility criteria
The eligibility criteria are also set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.
The basic eligibility check involves for most EU programmes if the content of the proposal is in
line with the topic description and if it involves participants coming from the right countries.
Additional criteria depend on the programme or specific topic (i.e. minimum consortium
composition, type of participant, geographic location of the project activities, coordinator from
an EU country, etc.).
For more information on participation of non-EU participants, see Who can apply section.
Outcome of the admissibility and eligibility check
If a proposal is inadmissible or ineligible, the participants will be informed (through the
coordinating organisation) and the rejection letter will be posted in their Portal library (My
Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Documents).
For complaints procedures against such rejections, see section Complaints about proposal
rejection.
3.2.2 Evaluation
Admissible and eligible proposals are sent on to evaluation by an independent evaluation
committee.
For most programmes the evaluation committee (panel) is made up of EU staff from the
Granting Authority and other services. They are often and assisted by outside experts for
individual evaluation and consensus group evaluation. For some programmes however (e.g.
Horizon Europe), the committee is usually composed exclusively of outside experts — for all
stages of the evaluation process (no internal staff).
The evaluation committee will also take position on the operational capacity of the consortium
and individual participants to properly implement the tasks planned. This assessment will be
based on the competence and experience of the participants, including operational resources
(human, technical and other) and is, for many programmes, integrated into the award criteria.
3.2.2.1 Award criteria
39EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Award criteria, scores thresholds and weighting
Proposals are evaluated and scored against award criteria set out in the call conditions on the
Topic page.
The award criteria, scores, thresholds and weightings depend on each programme and type of
action.
Globally speaking most programmes evaluate the following quality parameters: project
relevance, quality/implementation and impact. But in practice the labels vary and the
parameters are broken down into different aspects and focal points (see call conditions and, for
some programmes, the Programme Guides, e.g. Horizon Europe Programme Guide, Erasmus+
Programme Guide, AGRIP Programme Guide).
To be considered for funding, your proposal must score above a certain threshold for each
individual award criterion, and above an overall threshold for all of them together.
Moreover, in order to receive funding, your proposal must be ranked sufficiently to be above
the budget-threshold (relative positioning in the list of all proposals, compared to the other
proposals). For calls which provide for weightings, this ranking will also depend on the
weighting.
Your proposals will be evaluated on its own merit, and not its potential should certain
changes be made. Proposals with an inflated budget are likely to receive a lower score.
3.2.2.2 Evaluation and evaluation results
Evaluation process
Briefing
Evaluation: Individual evaluation > Consensus group > Panel review
Briefing of evaluators
Before starting the evaluation process, the evaluators are briefed on:
• the evaluation processes and procedures (including award criteria)
• the content of the topics under consideration
• the need to evaluate proposals as they were submitted, rather than their potential
should certain changes be made
• for outside experts: the terms of their contract (confidentiality, impartiality, conflicts of
interest, completing tasks and approving reports, penalties for non-compliance, etc).
For most EU programmes, there is no scope for recommending improvements to proposals
(including improvements on the budget).
Individual evaluation
During the individual evaluation, the evaluators work individually. Each evaluator gives a score
for each criterion, with explanatory comments, and prepares an individual evaluation report
(IER).
40EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Proposals are normally evaluated by at least three individual evaluators (for some programmes
and types of action, two may suffice; for many it is five).
The evaluators should also indicate if they consider that the proposal:
• is out of scope or
• involves security issues that will need further scrutiny.
Consensus group
After the individual evaluation, all evaluators who have evaluated the proposal will get together
in a consensus group, to agree on a common position on comments and scores.
For consensus groups made up of outside experts, the group will normally be assisted by a
member of the Granting Authority staff who will act as moderator to:
• seek a consensus, impartially and
• ensure that each proposal is evaluated fairly, according to the award criteria.
Panel review
After the consensus phase, the evaluation committee (panel) will take over and discuss the
proposals to:
• reach an agreement on the scores and comments for all proposals evaluated together,
checking consistency across the evaluations
• if necessary, propose a new set of marks or revise comments, and resolve cases where
evaluators were unable to agree
• rank the above-threshold proposals and give a priority order for proposals with the same
score.
Proposals with the same score
The evaluation committee will recommend a priority order for proposals with the same score,
using the procedure set out in the call conditions.
Interviews/hearings
If provided for in the call conditions, the evaluation committee (panel) may arrange
interviews/hearings.
In this case, invitations are sent to the coordinators of above-threshold proposals (and,
sometimes, also to those with scores above individual thresholds but below the overall
qualifying threshold).
The interviews/hearings may be held remotely or on site, in Brussels.
The questions to be asked will be determined by the panel beforehand and sent to all proposals.
The interviews/hearings will be used to get further information to clarify the proposals and help
the panel establish its final ranking list and scores. They may not serve to change proposals or
add missing information.
Outcome of evaluation
41EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
On the basis of the report and ranked list provided by the evaluation committee (panel), the
Granting Authority reviews the evaluation result, puts together the final ranking list and
informs the participants.
You can find the timing the evaluation and information on evaluation results in the call
conditions on the Topic page.
Final ranking — Reserve list — Rejections
The Granting Authority produces the final ranked list and the list of applications proposed
for funding.
The number of proposals in the list depends on the available budget. If the available budget is
too small to fund all above-threshold proposals (normally the case because EU grants are
heavily oversubscribed), some proposals may be put on a reserve list. These will then be
offered funding if a higher-scoring project does not go ahead or additional funds become
available.
The below-threshold proposals will be rejected.
Proposals will NOT be offered funding if the Granting Authority finds that it is already funding
very similar work elsewhere, or a proposal is in any way manifestly contrary to EU general
principles or established EU priorities or policies.
Evaluation result letters — Evaluation summary report
The participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) about their evaluation
result (together with the evaluation summary report (ESR)) and it will be posted in their Portal
library (My Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation >
Documents).
If your proposal was successful, you will get a grant preparation invitation letter. To follow
the further steps of preparing your grant, you will be prompted for each of the actions that need
to be carried out. Details are explained in the next section Grant preparation.
42EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please note that invitation to grant preparation is NOT a formal commitment for funding. The
final decision on your project will only be taken at a later stage — this depends on the finalisation
of grant preparation and further checks which we still need to make (i.e. financial capacity, non-
exclusion, etc).
If your proposal was not succesful, you will receive a rejection letter. The means of redress for
such rejections are described in the section Complaints about proposal rejection.
3.2.3 Special procedures: Ethics review, security scrutiny,
Ownership control check
Ethics review
In order to avoid funding of ethically problematic activities, some funding programmes require
an ethics review procedure to clear the projects (e.g. Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, EU4H,
AMIF).
The details and the scope of the ethics review depend on each programme. Most programmes
simply check whether projects raise ethics issues and, if so, whether these are adequately
addressed. Some programmes, such as Horizon Europe, have a more elaborated review
procedure which includes several steps depending on the complexity of the issues (see Horizon
Europe Programme Guide).
The participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) of the ethics review
result and it will be posted in their Portal library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Document Library).
If the ethics review leads to requirements to be implemented before grant signature, you will
need to take immediate action to comply (and may also have to adapt the description of the
action (DoA Part B) to reflect this). If the review leads to additional requirements to be fulfilled
during the project, they are automatically added as ethics deliverables into the system and DoA
Part A and will be placed in an automatically generated work package called ethics
requirements. If the review shows that there are serious ethics issues that cannot be solved,
funding may have to be refused.
You may be asked to provide additional information if this is needed to complete the ethics
review (e.g. in case of serious or complex ethics issues or missing information).

Security scrutiny
In order to ensure that classified information (for EU classified information (EUCI), see Decision
2015/444) is protected from unauthorised disclosure and that security issues emerging from
project activities are appropriately addressed, some EU programmes systematically provide for
a security review procedure for applications that operate in security relevant contexts (e.g.
European Defence Fund, Horizon Europe, Digital Europe).
The details and the scope of the security review depend on each programme. Some
programmes, such as Horizon Europe and Digital Europe, have a more elaborated security
review procedure which includes several steps depending on whether the topic under which a
proposal is submitted is flagged by the Commission as security sensitive or not (see Horizon
Europe Programme Guide).
43EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The security scrutiny (which is the final step of the more elaborated security review) is
essentially the same for all programmes: proposals must be cleared by the Security Scrutiny
Group (composed of national security experts nominated in agreement with their national
security authorities (NSAs)). The Security Scrutiny Group will determine the level of sensitivity
of the application and check whether all security aspects are being handled appropriately. You
will be informed about the result through your coordinator.
If the security scrutiny leads to requirements to be implemented before grant signature, you
will need to take immediate action to comply. If the scrutiny leads to classification and additional
requirements to be fulfilled during the project, this will be automatically reflected in the system
(classification of existing deliverables, limited dissemination of existing deliverables due to
security reasons, security aspect letter (SAL), security classification guide (SCG), appointment
of project security officer, establishment of security advisory board, etc.). If the scrutiny shows
that the project is too security sensitive, funding may have to be refused.

• How to handle security-sensitive projects
Third country control
Some programmes (or calls) limit the participation of entities which are controlled by third
countries (e.g. European Defence Fund, Digital Europe, Horizon Europe, CEF). In this case, a
special procedure is needed to verify ownership control of participants.

3.2.4 Grant preparation
Grant preparation
The Grant Agreement must be prepared directly in the Portal Grant Management System.
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Grant agreement data
preparation.
Who? The Grant Agreement data should be prepared by the consortium participants together
and submitted by the Coordinator.
How? You will be prompted by e-mail for all the actions that you need to carry out for the grant
preparation. For more details, see the list of grant-related notifications.
What? The grant preparation process consists of:
• setting up the Portal Grant Management System with the:
participants’ legal, administrative and financial information
o
description of the action (DoA, Annex 1 GA)
o
estimated budget (Annex 2 and 2a GA)
o
project variables (when the project starts, reporting periods, amount of
o
prefinancing, GA options, etc)
44EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
legal documents needed for grant signature (declarations of honour)
o
• so that the system can generate the Grant Agreement
and
• trigger signature directly inside the system (Grant Agreement and Accession Forms).
In parallel, the Granting Authority will perform the remaining legal checks to ensure that all the
successful proposals can receive EU funding (legal entity validation, financial capacity check,
non-exclusion check, etc).
Our Grant Agreement clauses are common to all EU programmes and mandatory for all
beneficiaries. They are explained in more detail in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
Grant preparation process
Enter & submit grant data: Entering legal, administrative & financial data > Preparing the
Description of the Action (DoA)
Signing the Grant Agreement
Description of the Action (DoA) (Part A and B)
The description of the action (DoA, Annex 1) is structured like the application form into
two parts, Parts A and B:
• Part A: contains the structured tables with project information (retrieved from the Grant
Management System tabs)
• Part B (the narrative part): is based on Part B of the application form and must be
uploaded as a PDF.
Creating Part B of the DoA is straightforward, as it can be derived directly from Part B of the
application. The instructions for this are available on Portal Reference Documents.
The system will merge the Parts A and B, generating a single PDF with the full description of
the action (DoA).
All participants can contribute to the parts, but it is the Coordinator who will have to finalise
and submit it.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Workplan tables: Complete the workplan tables in Part A, (work package descriptions,
deliverables and milestones)
• Check that all PICs have been validated by the Central Validation Service
• Quality check:
Check that the DoA is coherent and that information in Part A and B is consistent.
Some programmes will ask you not to simply attach the application, but to adapt Part
B. In this case, try to avoid overlaps between Parts A and B (delete work plan tables
from Part B, etc).
Check that DoA and the application match: please check if the content of the DoA differs
from the application, as this must be in compliance with your invitation letter to start
grant preparation. In addition, you may correct shortcomings identified by the experts
in the evaluation summary report. The information presented in the DoA can be made
45EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
more consistent if necessary. Any errors should be corrected (data displayed in a table
or figure is at odds with the description, etc).
Check that the DoA and the legal and administrative information match: for example, it
must describe the role and tasks performed by each Partner (Coordinator, Beneficiary,
Affiliated Entity, Third party providing in-kind contributions, etc) defined in the
structured part.
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed and no
annexes are missing.
Termination of grant preparation
If the consortium decides against the grant during grant preparation, they can launch the
termination process directly in the Portal. See the detailed screens and descriptions in the
on grant preparation termination.
This type of termination works only during grant preparation. Afterwards (after grant
signature), the grant must be formally terminated by amending the GA (early termination
amendment).

3.2.4.1 Enter & submit grant data
Actions to be completed before grant preparation
Organise access rights and roles
All Beneficiaries need access rights in order to prepare their grant data in the system and
sign the legal documents (declarations of honour, Grant Agreements and Accession Forms).
The contact persons of each organisation indicated in the proposal will automatically receive
access rights during grant preparation:
Proposal Grant preparation
Person who created the application ou PCoCo
submit the proposal?
Contact persons with full access rights CoCos (for Coordinator) + PaCos (for
other Beneficiaries)
46EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Contact persons with read-only rights Team Members (TeMes)
In addition, if your organisation has already been validated, the LEAR will normally also
already have been appointed.
Other persons and roles (especially LSIGNs and FSIGNs) will have to be appointed first by
the LEAR (My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation Roles > Add Roles) and then
assigned to the project by the CoCos and PaCos (My Projects > Actions > Project
Consortium > Edit Roles).
The minimum setup of roles that you need to prepare and conclude the Grant Agreement
are the following:
• for the Coordinator:
Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo) — already appointed
o
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
o
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN)
o
• for other Beneficiaries:
Participant Contact (PaCo)
o
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
o
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN).
o
The same person can fulfil several or all of the above roles.
Our system allows for only one signature on your side. If your internal rules require
several signatories, you must give an internal mandate to one of them and ensure that the
electronic signature in our system is executed only after all the necessary internal
authorisations were given. These authorisations must be collected, stored and kept by you
in line with your usual management practices (usually paper-based) so that they can be
provided to us in case of EU controls, checks or audits.
More details about nomination are in the Roles and access rights section.
Make sure all participants are registered and validated (PIC)
All Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities must be registered and validated in time for grant
signature (see section on Registration and validation of your organisation).
Associated Partners need to be only registered (have a PIC); no validation is needed,
because they will not receive any grant money.
Prepare and sign a consortium agreement (always recommended; in many
cases mandatory)
Consortium agreements are mandatory for many EU programmes. But even if they are not,
it is highly recommended to have arrangements in place to cover consortium-internal issues
that may arise during the project (e.g. decision-making procedures, resolve conflicts,
safeguard intellectual property rights, etc). The consortium agreement should be signed
before the Grant Agreement. For details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 7
and the How to establish your H2020 consortium agreement.
47EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Enter legal, administrative & financial data
You need to prepare the Grant Agreement in the Portal Grant Management System.
Details are explained in the .
Enter the structured information into the system (Part A of the DoA)
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation
> Grant agreement data preparation and transfer the information from your application
form (Part B) to the Work Packages, Deliverables, Milestones and Critical Risks screens.
You can move work packages up and down by drag & drop to position them in the order of
your preference. When a work package is moved to a new position, the numbering of WPs
(and also the relative numbering of deliverables) is automatically adapted.
Enter the other grant data into the system
a) Set the project starting date
Set the date on which the project is to start (starting date of the action) on the Project
Summary screen.
The options may vary depending on programme and type of action (see call conditions),
but generally there are 2 options:
• the first day of the month after entry into force (signature by EU) — default
option
• if needed, a fixed starting date may be agreed — this should be the first day of
a month and normally after grant signature (unless authorised otherwise by the
Granting Authority).
If you enter a fixed starting date, you will be asked to justify your choice. If you
chose a starting date before grant signature, you must explain why your project requires
this. Please note that the starting date can normally NOT be before the date on which
your application was submitted (unless explicitly allowed in the call conditions). Please
also note that any project activities taking place before grant signature bear the risk
that the grant may finally not be signed.
b) Check the project reporting periods
The reporting periods will be pre-filled for each call on the Reporting Periods screen.
To minimise administrative burden for you, we will choose the smallest possible number
of reporting periods. On average, most programmes tend to have reporting periods
between 12 and 18 months.
c) Check the prefinancing for the project
The standard prefinancing percentage will be pre-filled for each call on the Project
Financial Information screen.
The final prefinancing amount for each project will however be fixed only later, once the
budgetary information is completed from your side and the Granting Authority has
examined the results from the financial capacity assessment (see section Financial
capacity assessment). The prefinancing may be lowered in case of low financial capacity.
48EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
d) Complete the legal and administrative information for the participants
Fill in the missing information for each participant on the Partner Summary screen and
complete the Affiliated Entities and Associated Partner screens.
e) Define the budgets for the participants
Fill in the budget for each participant on the Partner Financial Information screens.
Make sure the budget details match the proposal and the GAP invitation letter (and the
detailed budget table, if required).
f) Provide the banking details for the Coordinator
Select the bank account to be used for payments from the dropdown menu on the
Coordinator’s Bank Account screen.
If your preferred bank account is not listed, you must ask your LEAR to add the bank
account in the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
Once the new bank account has been validated (this may take a few days), it will appear
in the dropdown menu and you will be able to select it.
f) Enter other information as prompted
Upload Part B of the description of the action (DoA)
Upload Part B on the Documents screen. Follow the instructions from Portal Reference
Documents.
Sign the declarations of honour (DoH)
For each Beneficiary, the PLSIGN must sign a declaration of honour (DoH) directly in the
system (grant declaration) .
Affiliated entities also need to sign a DoH. For them, the responsible Beneficiary must
download the template from Portal Reference Documents, ask each entity to complete and
sign it, then upload the scanned DoHs for their linked third parties.
Joint and several liability of Affiliated Entities (if required)
If the Granting Authority requires joint and several liability of an Affiliated Entity, the
declaration on joint and several liability must be submitted together with the Accession
Form.
The Beneficiary must download the form prepared by the system, ask the Affiliated Entity
to sign it and upload the scanned declaration when signing the Accession Form.
For more details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 22.
Prefinancing guarantee (if required)
If the Granting Authority requires a prefinancing guarantee, you need to obtain this from
a bank or approved financial institution (using the template available on Portal Reference
Documents), send a scanned copy through Portal Formal Notifications (My Projects >
Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) and
the original by registered post with proof of delivery to the mail address of the service
responsible for your grant.
49EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
For more details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 23.
Submit grant preparation to the Granting Authority
Assessment by the Granting Authority and finalisation of GA data
The Project Officer will enter the EU grant preparation data (GA options, etc) and check the
data submitted by the consortium. If needed, they will send back the session to the
consortium for changes/addition information (ping-pong).
Tips
Changes to consortium composition/project during grant preparation
Please note that consortia/projects can be altered ONLY under exceptional circumstances,
and ONLY if duly justified.
Nonetheless, there may be circumstances where you may need to change/adjust the consortium
composition/project before grant signature (bankruptcy, merger/acquisition, loss of a key
member of staff that is needed to carry out the project, etc).
In this case, your Coordinator should contact the EU Project Officer explain why and propose a
solution (reassign tasks and budget within the consortium or to a new participant, adjustments
to the project, etc).
If accepted, you may need to update the Grant Management System screens and upload a new
Part B.
Please note that the proposals may NOT be substantially changed and that all changed
elements must comply with the call conditions for the call. Redistribution of tasks must be in
line with the competences of the participants concerned and the quality of the
project/consortium must be guaranteed.
If no acceptable solution is presented, we will request you to withdraw the proposal and
terminate grant preparation.
Deadlines
In the interest of all sides, we will try to handle grant preparation as swiftly as possible (ideally
3 months after you receive the GAP invitation letter).
To make this happen, we will ask you to comply with relatively strict deadlines during grant
preparation:
• Preparation grant data & annexes (first version): 3 weeks after GAP invitation letter
• Finalisation grant data & annexes: up to 2 weeks after reply by Project Officer
• Sign declaration of honour (DoH): at the latest 6 weeks after GAP invitation letter.
• Grant signature: 3 months from GAP invitation letter
Deadlines can be extended under exceptional circumstances by the EU Project Officer.
Please note that if you have not been granted an extension, and fail to meet the established
deadlines, preparation of your Grant Agreement may be terminated and your proposal rejected.
3.2.4.2 Final legal checks
50EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
During grant preparation, we will also finalise the mandatory legal checks (legal entity
validation, operational and financial capacity, exclusion and double funding).
In case of issues, we may need to contact you.
3.2.5 Grant signature
Signing the Grant Agreement is the last step of the grant preparation phase. It is done directly
in the Portal Grant Management System (electronic signature) and demonstrates that both
contracting parties formally approve the agreement and its annexes.
The Grant Agreement enters into force with the last signature (normally the EU because the
Coordinator usually signs first).
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Sign.
Who? The Grant Agreement is signed by the EU and the Coordinator. The other Beneficiaries
do not sign the Grant Agreement itself, but accede to the Grant Agreement through Accession
Forms. Affiliated Entities or Associated Partners do not sign and do not become formal parties
to the Agreement.
How? You will receive e-mail notifications prompting the tasks needed for grant signature. For
more detail, see the list of grant-related notifications.
Signing EU Grant Agreements electronically —
What's involved?
The electronic signature in the Portal requires:
• a chain of trust with Beneficiaries — to guarantee signatories' identity
• a system of digital signatures protected by multiple security features — to guarantee
documents' reliability and authenticity
This type of electronic signature is used for signature of contracts, amendments and cost claims
(Financial Statements and invoices).
The chain of trust
LEAR
The Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR) appointed by the Beneficiary’s legal
representative (signed LEAR documents uploaded in the Participant Register) is the
centrepiece of the chain of trust. More in the section LEAR appointment and validation.
LEAR appoints all LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation
The LEAR vouches for the organisation data entered into the system and the nominated
persons. They appoint the individuals authorised to sign:
51EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Grant Agreements and amendments (Legal Signatories, known as LSIGNs)
• Financial Statements (Financial Signatories, known as FSIGNs).
The LEAR is responsible for keeping these lists constantly updated.
PaCO selects LSIGN and FSIGN for project
Participant Contacts (PaCo) or Coordinator Contacts (CoCos) have to select the Project
Legal Signatories (PLSIGNs) and Financial Signatories (PFSIGNs) from the LSIGN and
FSIGN lists nominated by the LEAR. For more information, check the section on Roles and
access rights.
Closed system where access rights are strictly controlled.
The chain of trust is built in a closed electronic exchange system. Each individual must
identify themselves with their personal EU Login account and access is strictly controlled.
Signing the Grant Agreement
Sign the declarations of honour (DoH)
Before the Grant Agreement can be signed, the PLSIGN of each Beneficiary must sign a
declaration of honour (grant declaration). For more details, see Enter legal administrative
& financial grant data.
Grant agreement ready for signature
The system prepares the Grant Agreement for signing (PDF document, digitally sealed to
guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).
Coordinator signs the Grant Agreement
The Coordinator's PLSIGN logs into the Portal My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Sign.
52EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
During signature, a pop-up explains that this means the signatory is preparing to sign. It
then asks the PLSIGN to confirm that they wish to sign and a second prompt asks the
PLSIGN to enter their EU Login password.
After signature, the system creates a new version of the PDF document (with a digital seal,
a time stamp, and the signatory's EU Login credentials on the signature placeholder). The
validity of the signature can be verified by opening it in a compatible PDF reader and clicking
on the image of the digital signature.
The Grant Agreement can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature)
from the Documents screen if desired.
The LEAR of the Coordinator and the other Beneficiaries are informed that the Coordinator
has signed the Grant Agreement.
Granting authority signs the Grant Agreement
The EU Authorising Officer is prompted to countersign the Grant Agreement from their side
(same procedure as under point 3).
The Participants will be informed and the countersigned Grant Agreement will be available
in their Portal Library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Document Library).
Participants sign the Accession forms
All other Beneficiaries' PLSIGNs are prompted to sign their Accession Forms (same
procedure as under point 3) — within 30 days after entry into force (signature by EU).
The CoCos and LEAR of the Coordinator and PaCo and LEAR of the concerned Beneficiary
are notified when an Accession Form has been signed.
Grant Agreement is finalised
Not signed Grant Agreement
• If the Coordinator does not sign, the Granting Authority may stop preparing the grant
and reject the proposal.
• If a Beneficiary does not sign the Accession Form within 30 days of the Grant Agreement
entering into force, the Granting Authority may terminate the Grant Agreement. In this
case, in order to continue with the project, the Coordinator must: request an
amendment, so that any changes needed to ensure that the project is carried out
properly can be made.
This request must be made within 30 days after the missed deadline for signing
o
the Accession Form.
The request for an amendment does not affect the Granting Authority's right to
o
terminate the Grant Agreement.
The Accession Form template is available for information on Portal Reference
Documents.
Project starting date
The project starting date is calculated as from the entry into force of the Grant Agreement (last
signature = signature by the EU).
53EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Prefinancing
The entry into force and starting date also determine the baseline date for the prefinancing (i.e.
the float that we normally pay immediately after grant signature).
Depending on the programme (see call conditions), prefinancing is either paid 30 days from:
• Horizon Europe, Digital, SMP, etc: the entry into force or 10 days before the starting
date or submission of the prefinancing guarantee (if required) — depending on which
is the latest
or
• CEF, LIFE, EMFAF, Erasmus, etc: the entry into force or submission of the prefinancing
guarantee (if required) — depending on which is the latest.

3.2.6 Complaints about proposal rejection
If you believe that the rejection of your proposal was based on an error in the selection
procedure, you can submit a complaint (following the deadlines and procedures set out in the
evaluation result letter).
Generally, the means of redress are the following:
• request for admissibility/eligibility or evaluation review (redress review) — within 30
days of receiving the letter
• for decisions by EU executive agencies: request for review of legality under Article 22
of Regulation 58/2003 — within 1 month of receiving the letter (using the Article 22
complaints form template)
• action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU — within 2 months of receiving the letter.
You are free to choose any of the above means of redress. However, in the interest of good
administration and procedural efficiency, it is recommended to use first the available
administrative review procedures (if any). The objective of these procedures is to re-examine
the circumstances of the selection procedure and to reach a final decision on your application.
Deadlines for further redress will therefore run as from when you receive our reply with the
final position.
Please note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending are
considered to have been accessed and that the deadlines will be counted from opening/access
(see Portal Terms and Conditions).
Complaints will be subject to the following conditions:
• Complaints must focus on aspects concerning the evaluation of the proposals (e.g.
admissibility or eligibility checks, evaluation procedure, etc), not their merits. Thus,
applicants can raise procedural irregularities, factual errors, manifest errors of
assessment or abuse of powers (e.g. lack of coherence between scores and comments,
lack or inadequate reasoning of the conclusions, the existence of a conflict of interests,
exceeding the limits of discretion, etc). Mere repetitions of the content of the proposal
or disagreements with the result or reasoning of the technical evaluation will not be
considered.
54EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Only one request for review per proposal will be considered. The request cannot refer
to the evaluation of proposals submitted by other applicants or under different or
previous calls.
• Review requests will not always necessarily also lead to a re-evaluation of your proposal
(new technical evaluation with new group of evaluators). The administrative review
procedure will re-examine your case, but a re-evaluation will be decided only if your
complaint demonstrates that the procedural irregularity, factual error, manifest error of
assessment or abuse of powers affects the decision on whether to fund the proposal.
Thus, for example, a problem relating to one of the evaluation criteria will not lead to a
re-evaluation if, even by adding the maximum points under this criterion, the final score
of the proposal would still remain below the threshold for funding.
• Re-evaluations will be made on the proposal as it was originally submitted; no additional
information will be admitted. Re-evaluations will be partial (limited to the criterion
affected by the error) or full (when the whole evaluation has been recognized as flawed)
— depending on the case. They may be assigned to the same evaluation panel or a new
one, depending on the internal procedures of the Granting Authority.
• The score following a re-evaluation may be lower than the original score.
• All requests for review will be treated as confidential.
Please pay attention to who took the formal decision and who the complaint must be addressed
to. If a decision was taken by an EU executive agency or other EU body, both redress review
and applications for annulment must be directed against that agency/body (NOT against the
European Commission). Only Article 22 complaints must be addressed to the respective
Directorate-General of the Commission (parent DG of the executive agency).
In case you consider that there has been maladministration on our part, you can also address
a complaint to the European Ombudsman — within 2 years after you became aware of it AND
after having used all the means of administrative redress available (redress and Article 22
request, if any).
3.3 Grant management
3.3.1 Keeping records
All participants must keep records and other supporting documentation in order to prove
the proper implementation and the costs claimed (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art
20).
For Lump Sum grants, records on costs incurred are exceptionally NOT needed; it is enough to
keep the evidence to prove the proper implementation of the action.

3.3.2 Amendments
Amendments requested by the consortium
55EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If there are any changes to the Grant Agreement (e.g. data or options specific to that
agreement) or its annexes, they must be done through a formal amendment directly in the
Portal (electronic signature).
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Request for Amendment.
Who? Amendments can be prepared by the consortium participants together, but only the
Coordinator can launch, sign and submit them.
The EU Granting Authority can also propose amendments, but for practical reasons we will often
as you to initiate the procedure.
When? Amendments must normally be done before the end of the project, but some
amendment clauses are also open afterwards (addition of Beneficiary/Affiliated
Entity/Associated Partner, change of Coordinator, change of Annex 1, change of Annex 2,
change of bank account, error amendments, etc).
What? Cases requiring a formal amendment are listed in the AGA — Annotated Grant
Agreement, art 39. See also How to prepare an amendment in the .
Amendments are normally NOT necessary for:
• budget transfers covered by the budget flexibility
• name or address changes of a participant — done directly in the Participant Register
• universal takeovers (merger/acquisition) of a participant — done directly in the
Participant Register
• changes of the banking details — done directly in the Participant Register.
The signed amendment is the legal document containing the changes to the Grant
Agreement. It is legally binding and will be incorporated into the Agreement. The consolidated
version is only for information.
Amendment process
Get ready > Launch amendment > Amendment preparation > Consult Commission >
Sign&Submit > Assessment > Countersign
Amendment request
The amendment request consists of:
• updated structured information on the Grant Management System screens
• amendment request letter: the letter with the request and reasons for the amendment
• amendment core (including new version of GA Annexes 1 and 2, if needed): the legal
document with the list of amendment clauses
• supporting documents: documents uploaded by the consortium, consolidated Grant
Agreement, etc
All participants can contribute to the amendment, but it is the Coordinator who will have to
launch, finalise, submit and sign the request.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
56EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Check that the updated information Grant Management System screens is correct.
• Quality check: Check that the Amendment documents are correct and all supporting
documents attached.
Actions to be completed before amendment
Make sure new participants are registered and validated (PIC)
New Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities must be registered and validated in the Participant
Register before the amendment can be requested (see section on Registration and
validation of your organisation).
Associated Partners need to be only registered (have a PIC); no validation is needed,
because they will not receive any grant money from us.
Make sure that new bank accounts are registered and validated
New banking information must be registered and validated in the Participant Register
before an amendment can be requested (see section on Bank account registration and
validation).
Submitting an amendment
Amendments must be prepared in the Portal Grant Management System.
Details are explained in the .
Get ready
Before launching your amendment request, prepare the supporting documents and, if
needed, discuss the request beforehand with the EU Project Officer (— recommended for
more complicated cases).
Launch the amendment

Once the amendment is been launched, you can amend the grant data in the same way as
as you did when preparing the Grant Agreement.
Enter the amendment information into the system
a) Justification
57EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Fill out the field to justify the request on the Amendment Information screen.
b) Amendment clauses
On the basis of the changes to the grant data, the system will automatically select the
relevant amendment types (automatic clauses) on the Amendment Information screen.
Other types of amendment have to be selected manually by the EU Project Officer,
(change of Annex 1, change in the maximum grant amount, resuming the action after
suspension, etc). Contact the Project Officer to activate the clause.
In case a change triggers the need for another change, a prompt will appear.
Upload annexes and supporting documents
You will be prompted to upload mandatory supporting documents. These depend on the
type of amendment and the specific case (e.g. a new Beneficiary must provide the DoH
and the Accession Form).
Consult Granting Authority
Once ready, the amendment request must be submitted to the Granting Authority for
informal assessment.
Informal assessment by the Granting Authority
The Project Officer will check that the amendment request is correct and admissible. If
needed, they will send it back to the consortium for changes/additional information (ping-
pong).
Coordinator signs & submits the amendment request
Once the request for an amendment is complete and ready to be submitted, the system
generates the 2 documents (amendment request letter and amendment core) for signature
(PDF document, digitally signed to guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).
The Coordinator’s PLSIGN logs into My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Amendment
> Sign & Submit (same procedure as for Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant
Agreement).
The amendment can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature) from
the Documents screen if desired.
As Coordinator, you cannot alter a request for an amendment once it has been signed
and submitted. There are 2 options:
• You withdraw it.
• The Granting Authority rejects it (amendment rejection letter).
Formal assessment by the Granting Authority
The Granting Authority has 45 days to accept or reject the request.
This deadline will be extended if needed (e.g. if the amendment are complex, specific
compliance checks are needed for a new participant, or if the project has to be reviewed to
assess the changes).
58EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Granting authority signs the amendment
Acceptance: If the Granting Authority accepts the request, they countersign it from their
side (same procedure as for Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant Agreement).
The Coordinator and Beneficiaries will be informed and the countersigned amendment will
be available in their Portal Library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Project
Library).
Rejection: If the request is rejected, the consortium will be informed by amendment
rejection letter.
Amendment number — Once the amendment is countersigned, it is automatically assigned
a sequential amendment number (1, 2, 3, etc). For instance, an amendment request with
the reference AMD-345622-6 is assigned number 2 if it is the 2nd signed amendment for
the grant. Rejected amendments are assigned a number (R1, R2); but they are saved, so
that they can be reused to draw up a new request.
The Coordinator’s PLSIGN can withdraw a submitted request until it is countersigned.
Withdrawn requests are saved and can be reused to submit a new request.
Entry into force & taking effect
An amendment proposed by a consortium enters into force on the day the Granting Authority
signs it.
It takes effect (i.e. the changes to the Grant Agreement start to apply) either:
• on a specific date specified in the amendment or
• on the date of entry into force (last signature = signature by the EU).
Depending on the nature of the amendment, the date on which it takes effect may affect
the eligibility of costs (e.g. if a Beneficiary is added, costs are eligible from the accession date
specified in the Accession Form).
Coordinator change without their agreement
If the Coordinator is to be replaced without their agreement, another Beneficiary (acting on
behalf of the other Beneficiaries in the consortium) must submit the amendment request.
To do this, you will need to contact the EU Project Officer, so that they can give you
(exceptional) PCoCo access rights in the system.
Please note you will have to provide proof both of the consortium decision to change the
Coordinator, to nominate you to act on their behalf AND the opinion of the changed Coordinator
(or at least proof that the opinion was requested) — otherwise the termination will be considered
improper.
Amendments initiated by the Granting Authority
If the Granting Authority requests an amendment, the request is also prepared and signed
electronically in the Portal Grant Management System.
You will receive an e-mail notification prompting you to accept the request.
To do so, the Coordinator's PLSIGN must countersign the amendment on the consortium's
behalf.

3.3.3 Continuous reporting on milestones & deliverables
During the project, you are expected to provide regular updates on the status of the project:
the continuous reporting.
The continuous reporting includes:
• progress in achieving milestones
• deliverables
• updates to the publishable summary
• response to critical risks, publications, communications activities, IPRs
• programme-specific monitoring information (if required).
Where? The Continuous Reporting Module is accessible through the link you receive at the
beginning of the project.
Who? Milestones and deliverables should be submitted by each participant for their work.
What? You should report on milestones and deliverables in accordance with the schedule set
out for them.
The Continuous Reporting Module also allows you to report on critical risks, prepare the
summary for publication and the programme-specific information on indicators (e.g. Trainings,
Gender, Open Data, etc — if available for your programme and type of action).
Milestones — Control points in the project that help to chart progress (kick-off meetings,
steering committes, first-draft of a survey, prototype, etc). They may correspond to the
completion of a key deliverable, which allows the next phase of the work to begin or is needed
at intermediary points.
Deliverables — Outputs to be submitted to the EU (publication, leaflet, progress report,
brochure, list, etc).
All this information is automatically compiled to create part A of the periodic Technical Report,
at the moment this report is prepared (Locked for review).
Reporting in the Continuous Reporting Module
At the beginning of the project, you will receive a notification (+ link) that the Continuous
Reporting Module is activated and that you can contribute to it on an ongoing basis.
Detailed information on the Module can be found in the .
Update the project summary
60EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please note that you must provide a separate summary for each periodic report (just
update the summary for the previous period).
The summary must be suitable for direct publication by the Granting Authority,
especially:
• be a stand-alone text — no references to other parts of the report, only to publicly
available information.
• easily understandable by a general audience
• preferably not longer than 7,480 characters (roughly 2 pages)
• with no confidential/sensitive data
You can upload diagrams or photographs illustrating and promoting your project work (
only as images and you must have cleared any rights of third parties advance).
You can also mention the websites used to promote the EU project (see section
Communicating and promoting the project).
Update the deliverables
The deliverables must be submitted according to the timing specified in the Continuous
Reporting section.
At the time the periodic report is submitted, check if all deliverables due have been
provided and, if not, give an explanation in the Comments column (especially for missing
or late deliverables and/or cancelled or grouped deliverables).
Update the milestones
Specify whether the milestones were achieved or not. If not, enter an estimate of when.
The milestones table included in each periodic report is cumulative (it shows all milestones
from the beginning of the project).
Update the critical risks
Assess the state of play of the listed risks and if necessary specify new mitigation
measures or add newly identified risks.
Programme-specific monitoring information (if required)
Some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) have additional policy-monitoring screens on
indicators which require input (Publications, Dissemination, Patents (IPR), SME
participation, Gender, Infrastructure, Innovation, Open data, ABS Regulation, Trainings).

3.3.4 Reports & payment requests
61EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
In order to receive payments, the consortium must submit periodic reports (following the
schedule set out in the Grant Agreement). When these are due, they must be submitted directly
in the Periodic Reporting Module of the Portal Grant Management System.
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Technical Part contribution/Financial Statement
drafting.
Who? The periodic report should be prepared by the consortium participants together and
submitted by the Coordinator.
How? You will be prompted by e-mail for all the actions that you need to carry out for the
periodic reporting.
What? In the periodic report, you should report on the progress of the work and costs claimed
(see below Periodic Report). When the Coordinator submits the periodic report, the IT tool will
capture the information from the Continuous Reporting Module in order to generate the Part A
of the Technical Report. The system will also consolidate the Individual Financial Statements
and it will generate the use of resources report (if required) and the Summary Financial
Statements (for the consortium).
Reporting process
Continuous reporting > Preparing your periodic report > Approving Partners' reports >
Submitting the report to the Commission > Acceptance or rejection by the Commission >
Interim payment
Periodic report: Technical Report (Part A and B) and Financial Report
The periodic report consists of two parts, the Technical Report and Financial Report.
The Technical Report is itself also divided in two parts, Parts A and B:
Part A: contains the structured tables with project information (retrieved from the Grant
Management System).
Part B (the narrative part): mirrors the application form and requires the participants to report
on differences (delays, work not implemented, new subcontracts, budget overruns etc). It must
be uploaded as PDF document.
The Financial Report consists of the structured individual and consolidated Financial
Statements (retrieved from the Grant Management System). In addition, most programmes
require either a detailed cost reporting table (excel table) or the use of resources report (online
wizard) and, for payments above a certain thresholds, a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS).
The technical report Part A and the financial report is generated automatically on the basis of
the data in the Grant Management System; Part B needs to be prepared outside the tools (using
62EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
the template downloaded from the system) and then uploaded as PDF (together with Annexes,
if any).
All participants should contribute to the parts, but it is the Coordinator who will have to submit
them as a single report.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Check that the Continuous Reporting Module is updated in time (before the Periodic
Report is Locked for review).
• Check that all participants have submitted their Financial Statements (and CFS, if
needed)
• Quality checks:
Check that the Report is coherent and that information in Part A and B is consistent.
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed and no
annexes are missing.
Certificate on the Financial Statements (CFS)
The CFS is a report produced by an independent auditor (or, for public bodies, public officer)
using the template available on Portal Reference Documents. Its purpose is to give assurance
to the Granting Authority about the regularity of the costs claimed.
The thresholds depend on the EU programme and type of action (see call conditions on the
Topic page). For the MFF 2021-2027, there is usually a single threshold of EUR 325 000
requested EU contribution.
Please note that costs already audited by the Granting Authority do not have to be covered
again by the CFS (the EU contribution covered by the audit can therefore be excluded from the
calculation of the threshold).
The CFS must be uploaded as a scanned copy (PDF) together with the Financial Statement. The
originals must be kept in the your files.
Submitting the periodic reports
You should start preparing the periodic report in the Grant Management System right after the
periodic reporting is opened at the end of each reporting period (— deadline for submission is
normally 60 days).
Details on how to submit are available in the .
Make sure that the information in the Continuous Reporting Module is updated
This must be done before the Technical Report (both parts) is first Locked for review by
the Coordinator. Any entries into the Continuous Reporting Module made afterwards will
NOT be included in this periodic report.
Complete your Financial Statements
63EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Financial Statement
drafting and complete the Financial Statements for each participant on their Financial
Statement screen.
Make sure the cost details match the use of resources or detailed budget table (if required).
To sign and submit to the Coordinator, the Beneficiary’s PFSIGN must log into My Projects
> Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Sign & Submit (same procedure as for
Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant Agreement).
Affiliated Entities must supply their Beneficiary with a signed paper Financial Statement;
the Beneficiary must then fill in the information in the system and sign and submit.
If you fail to submit a Financial Statement, your costs will be considered zero for this
reporting period (but you can declare them in the next reporting period).
Upload Part B of the technical report
Upload Part B on the Technical Report Part B screen (as a single PDF). Use the template
available inside the system. This can be done by any Beneficiary (not only the Coordinator).
If any changes to Part B are needed, you must delete the pdf file and upload a new one.
When both Parts A and B are ready to submit, the Technical Report can be finalised by the
Coordinator (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Accept &
Include).
Coordinator approves Partners' financial reports
The Coordinator must review and explicitly approve the periodic report. If needed, you can
send back a Financial Statement to a Partner for further changes, or unlock the Technical
Report for editing.
Before submitting, all the accepted Partners' Financial Statements must be included (My
Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Include).
Missing statements
Sometimes you may decide to submit the report without Financial Statements from certain
Partners (e.g. if a Beneficiary cannot submit its individual Financial Statement on time). If
this happens, you will be asked to confirm that you are aware of this and that therefore
these costs will not be considered for the current payment. The participant's costs will be
considered zero for this reporting period, but they will be able to declare their costs in the
next financial report (next reporting period).
Submit the report to the Granting Authority
The Coordinator must submit all parts of the periodc report together (all the individual
Financial Statements and Part B of the Technical Report): My Projects > Actions > Manage
Project > Periodic Reporting > Submit to EU. The system will automatically generate the
report with explanations of the use of resources and the periodic Summary Financial
Statements, which includes the request for payment.
Acceptance or rejection by the Granting Authority
The Granting Authority will either:
• accept the report and start preparing the payment or
64EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• ask for changes to it — which means that the process described above starts
again.
Payment
When the Granting Authority approves the payment, the amount due will be paid out to
the Coordinator (within 90 days of receiving the report)
If the amount due is above the interim payment ceiling (90% of the maximum grant
amount), the amount due will be lowered.
The Granting Authority will send a letter to inform about the payment. After receiving the
letter, the Coordinator has 30 days to submit observations, if needed. In case of
observations, the Granting Authority will send a confirmation letter to state its final
position.
Final report
The Periodic Reporting Module (and periodic reports) are also used for the final report (report
for the last reporting period, to close the grant). The system behaviour, screens and documents
used are the same.
Beneficiary termination reporting
If one of the Beneficiaries has to leave the consortium, the the Coordinator has to prepare a
termination report (Technical Report Part B and Financial Report) and a report on the
distribution of payments to this Beneficiary in the Grant Management System.
Details on the steps to follow are explained in the .

3.3.5 Communicating your project — Acknowledgement of EU
funding
Since the EU grants are financed by public funds, EU Beneficiaries are generally expected to
actively engage in communication activities, to promote the projects and to publicly
acknowledge the EU support.
Communicating and promoting the project
65EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
What does communication involve?
The communication activities must already be part of the proposal (either as a specific work
package for communication or by including them in another work package). Communication will
be taken into consideration as part of the award criteria.
A good communication plan should define clear objectives (adapted to various relevant
target audiences) and set out a description and timing for each activity.
With your communication activities you should draw the attention (general and specialised
audiences) to the EU policy area addressed by the call.
Regarding typical communication activities (and indicators to measure them), you can refer to
the communication network indicators we use for our own communication activities.
In addition, some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) may have more targeted communication
guidance (see Horizon Europe Programme Guide).
Good communication
• Starts at the outset of the action and continues throughout its entire lifetime
• Is strategically planned and not just ad-hoc efforts
• Identifies and sets clear communication objectives (e.g. have final and intermediate
communication aims been specified? what impact is intended? what reaction or change
is expected from the target audience?)
• Is targeted and adapted to audiences that go beyond the project's own community,
including the media and the public
• Chooses relevant messages (e.g. how does the action's work relate to our everyday
lives? why does the target audience need to know about the action?)
• Uses the right medium and means (e.g. working at the right level — local, regional,
national, EU-wide; using the right ways to communicate — one-way exchange (website,
press release, brochure, etc) or two-way exchange (exhibition, school visit, internet
debate, et.); where relevant, include measures for public/societal engagement on issues
related to the action)
• Is proportionate to the scale of the action.
Acknowledgement of EU funding
Beneficiaries of EU funding must display the EU flag and funding statement (“Funded by the
European Union” or “Co-funded by the European Union”) in all their communication and
dissemination activities and any infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, supplies or major result
results funded by the grant.
The EU flag and funding statement must be displayed in a way that is easily visible for the public
and with sufficient prominence.
EU funding must moreover be acknowledged in all types of public outputs (including patent
applications, EU standardisation of results), media contacts and other public statements.
The EU flag and funding statement are available in the Grant Agreement and on the Europa
website.

• 60-minute workout webinar to increase the communication impact of your project
3.3.6 Dissemination & exploitation of project results
Since EU grants are financed by public funds, EU Beneficiaries moreover also expected to
disseminate their project results. In this way, the projects can benefit a larger group of persons
and reach wider target groups.
Several programmes will therefore ask you to upload results on dedicated results portals
(accessible through the Portal Projects & Results page).
Some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) will require more extensive dissemination and
exploitation activities (e.g. open access, exploitation obligation, etc; see Horizon Europe
Programme Guide).
In case of specific questions on intellectual property, the EU IP Helpdesk may provide support.
Links
• AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 16 and Annex 5
3.3.7 Checks, audits, reviews & investigations
In order to ensure sound financial management and compliance with the Grant Agreement
rules, the Granting Authority will perform project reviews and financial audits on participants.
For lump sum grants, since they do not use actual costs, there will be no financial audits focusing
on costs. Reviews will focus on the technical implementation of the action or other aspects of
the Grant Agreement.
Project reviews
The Granting Authority will regularly monitor the project implementation and check the proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the Grant Agreement obligations, including
assessing deliverables and reports.
In addition, the Granting Authority may also carry out in-depth project reviews. Those reviews
focus typically on the technical implementation of the project, but may also cover financial and
budgetary aspects or compliance with other obligations under the GA.
Audits
In addition, most programmes perform financial audits of participants in EU projects (often with
the help of outside audit firms).
Such audits will be performed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. The
auditors comply with ethical requirements and will plan and perform relevant procedures in line
with the EU Grants Indicative Audit Programme, in order to obtain reasonable assurance that
the Financial Statements are free of material misstatement.
You will receive a draft audit report on which you will be able to provide your observations.
If systemic errors are found, the Granting Authority may extend the findings of the audit
results to non-audited Grant Agreements or non-audited periods.
67EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Anti-fraud strategy — OLAF investigations
In case of fraud suspicions, the Granting Authority will inform the European Anti-fraud Office
(OLAF), who may conduct more in-depth investigations.
OLAF also cooperates with national authorities (through information exchange, on-the-spot
checks, coordination of forensic audits etc).
Related Certifications
Certificate on the methodology for unit cost (CoMUC)
The CoMUC is a factual report produced by an independent auditor (using the template available
on Portal Reference Documents). Its purpose is to enable the granting authority to:
• identify your usual cost accounting practices
• check that you have used a suitable unit cost accounting methodology.
Submitting a CoMUC methodology certificate is voluntary. Doing so will help prevent problems
later on, if your grant is audited. If the certificate is approved, costs declared in line with this
methodology will not be challenged, unless you have concealed information for the purpose of
the approval.
For the MFF 2021-2027, only CEF and Digital Europe will be using this certification. For Horizon
Europe it has been replaced by the SPA (systems and process audit; see AGA — Annotated
Grant Agreement, art 24).
The certificate may be requested at any time during the implementation of the programme.
As a minimum, one project should have been started and the data available must give the
auditor enough of a basis to carry out the necessary procedures. Ideally, we would recommend
submitting the methodology after at least one reporting period has passed.
In case of subsequent changes to your methodology you should notify the Granting Authority.
You may also submit a new certificate reflecting the changes.

3.3.8 Communicating with the Granting Authority
Formal notification
The formal notification channel (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) can be used ONLY for correspondence requiring
acknowledgement of receipt, i.e.
• to dispatch replies to formal notifications received from the Granting Authority
and
• for communications under Article 19 of the Grant Agreement
information requests
o
information about events and circumstances which impact the action and
o
• whenever it is clearly stipulated in the Grant Agreement (e.g. declare conflict of interest,
force majeure).
Portal Messaging Facility
The two Portal Messaging Facilities should be used for all other communications:
• Participant Register: My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation
• Grant Management System: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Process
Communications)
The Grant Management System Messaging Facility can be used only by the Coordinator.
4. Procurement
EU calls for tenders are published both on the Portal and on the TED — Tenders Electronic Daily
web site.
Currently, calls for tenders are published under the Portal Search funding & tenders page of the
Portal and the users are then redirected to the e-Tendering website for the submission of
tenders and documentation.
Read about public procurement procedures in the Portal Procurement section and the
eProcurement wiki.
5. Prizes
Prizes are also published on the Portal (Search funding & tenders page).
6. Financial instruments
Financial instruments (debt and equity instruments) are not published on the Portal, but they
are accessible via a direct link to the Europa Access to finance website, where you can locate
banks or funds which provide risk finance supported by the EU.
7. Working as an expert
69EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Introduction
The EU services managing grants and tenders frequently make use of different types of
independent experts to assist them with the implementation, evaluation and monitoring of their
funding programmes. These include:
• Evaluators
• Observers
• Ethics evaluators
• Monitors
• Ethics monitors
• business coaches
As an expert you perform this work as an independent individual and do NOT represent a
company or organisation.
The EU services recruit experts from the Portal Expert Database, where you can register at
any time. Registration is open to experts of any nationality including those outside of the EU
and Associated Countries.
To find out exactly what type of knowledge and skills we are looking for, see call for expression
of interest.
Working as an expert in short:
• Place of work: All or part of the evaluation and monitoring may be carried out at your
home or place of work (remote evaluation), or at the offices of the service concerned
(usually Brussels or Luxembourg), depending on the type of work to be done. Project
review sessions and audits, involving project representatives, may take place either at
the service’s offices or on the Beneficiaries' premises.
• Conflicts of interest: You will NOT be appointed for proposals or projects if you have
a vested interest that could influence the way you evaluate them. For more detail, please
see the section on Contracting and payments and the Model Contract for Experts.
• Confidentiality: If you are going to be handling classified information, you will need
security clearance before you can sign a contract.
• Remuneration: As an expert, you will normally receive EUR 450 for each full day
worked. However for remote evaluation and ethics review, we have developed a new
simplified methodology to calculate the amounts, please see details in the contracting
& payment section. Your travel and subsistence costs will be refunded.
• Amount of work: Projects are usually monitored and evaluated in sessions lasting 15
days a year at most. The number of proposals you assess will largely depend on the
area concerned. An independent expert may normally earn up EUR 90 000 in a four
calendar year period (counting fees only and at the current rate this equals 200 days).
In depth - working as an expert:
• How you can become an expert: start with registering as an expert
• You will be offered to sign a contract, if you are selected as an expert. To find out more

7.1 Expert registration
Registering as an expert
To work as expert, you will first need to register.
To register, go to the Experts' page on the Funding & Tenders Portal. To access the registration
forms, you'll need an EU Login account, which you can set-up on the same website if you don't
yet have one.
Once you've done this, you can log in to your account any time and view, update or complete
your profile in “My Expert Area”.
Click on the "Register as an expert" button. To create your profile, you'll need to specify:
• personal details, knowledge of languages, education and training
• area of expertise
• professional experience (employment, past involvement in EU research programmes,
publications or other achievements...)
To find out exactly what type of knowledge and skills we are looking for, see the call for
expression of interests.
Privacy
Once you have completed all sections and your profile status appears as 'valid', you become
eligible for selection for an assignment. However, registration as an expert in the database
does not guarantee automatic selection. The EU services will select experts according to their
needs of expertise.
If you are selected, you will be contacted directly by the service concerned.
Selection of experts
Experts will be selected for assignments from the database of experts who registered in My
Expert Area.
The experts will be selected for each assignment on the basis of the specific expertise needed.
For each assignment (e.g. evaluation of a call or monitoring of projects), a 'pool' of experts
is drawn-up on the basis of the following criteria:
71EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Experts have a high level of skills, experience and knowledge in the relevant
area, including project management, innovation, exploitation, dissemination
and communication. Where relevant, inter-disciplinary experts, those with
expertise in appropriate disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, as well as
gender specialists are included in the 'pool'.
• If this condition is satisfied, the 'pool' should have a balanced composition in terms
of various skills, experience and knowledge, geographical diversity and
gender. With respect to gender, the policy of the EU is one of equal opportunities for
women and men and, in this context, we have a target of 40% of the under-represented
sex in evaluation panels and expert groups.
• A private-public sector balance is assured, if appropriate.
• Experts are regularly rotated by ensuring that individual experts do not work more
than 200 days activities within consecutive 4 calendar years (EUR 90 000 EUR). With
respect to evaluations in particular, for each call, at least 25% of experts included in the
'pool' should be newcomers, i.e. not have evaluated for the call in the previous 3 years.
The 'pool' of experts is drawn-up well in advance of the assignment in question and the final
list of experts selected from the initial 'pool' is made once the precise needs in terms of expertise
are known, e.g. in the case of an evaluation, after the call deadline once the proposals are
known. Consequently, extra experts are generally included in the 'pool' to ensure the expertise
required is covered and to foresee a sufficient reserve, should some no longer be in a position
to carry out the task.
7.2 Signing a contract and payment
Contracts
If you are selected as an expert, you will be offered a contract to be signed and managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. This contract (including its annexes) defines all the
rights, obligations, terms and conditions applicable to you. It is not an employment contract or
agreement.
Your contract will be based on the Model Contract for Experts. Some of the terms and conditions
in your contract will vary, depending on the type of expert activity that you are asked to carry
out. The contract will indicate
• whether or not your work will involve travel,
• the maximum number of days of work that you will be paid for and
• the planned calendar for your work.
Your correspondence with the EU services
All your correspondence with us is electronic. You should use only My Expert Area (Funding &
Tenders Portal) to communicate about your contract, e.g.
• submitting your identity/bank account details
• signing your contract (electronic-signature)
• making requests for payment and providing related supporting documents.
For any other correspondence related to your contract that the My Expert Area does not
currently support, use the email address indicated in Article 21.3 of your contract.
72EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Signing the contract
You must sign the contract online in My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal. You will
receive an email notification inviting you to do so, with a link to the contract.
The contract enters into force only once it has been signed by both parties. The contract must
be signed by both yourself and the EU service concerned by the day on which you start working
as an expert. Please do not forget to obtain permission from your employer to carry out your
expert activities if your employer requires this for outside activities – this is your responsibility.
You may start work as soon as the contract has entered into force.
If you have a contract to act as an evaluator or monitor, you will be granted access to the IT
system for the relevant proposals or project reports once the contract has entered into force.
Code of conduct
You need to adhere to the code of conduct in Annex 1 of the model contract, which includes
rules on the performance of the contract and obligations of impartiality and confidentiality.
Please carefully read Annex 1 before signing the contract.
Conflicts of interest
When contracting independent experts, the EU services ensure — to the best of their knowledge
- that you, as an expert, do not have any conflicts of interest on the activity that you are being
asked to undertake and, in particular, any proposal or project you are called upon to assess.
You should be independent, impartial and objective, and behave professionally at all times.
The contract you sign before starting work includes a declaration that you accept and will
abide by the Code of Conduct (Annex 1 of the contract). This means, amongst other things,
that
• you declare that no conflict of interest exists and
• you will inform the EU service concerned if you should discover that any such conflict
arises in the course of your duties.
• If, at the time that you sign the contract, you are already aware that you may be in a
position of conflict of interest, you are required to declare this.
Conflict of Interest impact?
To avoid situations of conflicts of interest, the EU services may withdraw experts from
evaluation or monitoring duties if it deems that this is necessary. You will be informed if this
happens to you and advised as to what to do if you need to take action.
• If you knowingly conceal a conflict of interest and this is discovered during your activities
as an expert, you will be dismissed with immediate effect, your contract will be
terminated and the measures laid down in the contract will be taken.
Example: Submitting proposals for funding while working as an expert
• If you submit a research proposal for evaluation, you are not necessarily excluded from
acting as an expert evaluator, provided that you declare it and that there is no conflict
of interest. In this case, you will not be assigned to evaluate your own proposal or any
proposals which may be competing with it.
We strongly advise you make sure that you have properly understood the provisions laid down
in the Code of Conduct, especially which situations are automatically considered to be a conflict
of interest.
Confidentiality
73EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If your role involves handling classified information, you will need security clearance before
entering into a contract.
The EU publishes an annual list of experts who have worked for us but we do not disclose who
has worked on which proposals.
Before assigning a project to you for monitoring activities, the EU services may inform the
project consortium of your name. The consortium may reject our choice of expert in the
interests of commercial confidentiality.
Payment
Requests for payment
Once your work is completed, you will receive an e-mail inviting you to submit your request
for payment through My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Travel expenses — When you claim your travel expenses, you should upload scanned copies of
all the original supporting documents as requested.
You must keep records and other supporting documents for at least two years after the payment
is made to show that you have complied in full with the terms of your contract.
Deadline — You should submit your request for payment within 30 days of receiving the email
invitation.
Bank account — You should request payment on one of the bank accounts which you have listed
in My Expert Area.
The EU services will make payments within 30 days of receiving the reports, deliverables or
completed payment requests (whichever comes latest) provided they are complete and
approved
Amount of the payment
The daily rate is EUR 450 for work including travel such as participating at evaluations,
monitoring activites or meetings at the commission or beneficiary premises. This is calculated
to the nearest half day (EUR 225) except in the following two cases:
• for remote work carried out by evaluators, any work that you are specifically asked to
carry out remotely will be paid in accordance with Article 4.1 of your contract.
• you are covered by one of the exceptional situations for which a zero fee contract must
be issued (e.g. for former EU staff in receipt of an allowance) or you requested that a
zero fee contract be issued
The contract sets out the maximum total number of days of work (and amount) that you can
be paid for. This is an upper ceiling. The actual amount that you will be paid is based on the
actual task assigned and worked; this may be less than the maximum amount.
• Please note that you will not receive payment for tasks that are not covered by the
contract (or an amendment to it) and which are not specifically assigned to you, either
via the relevant IT system, or in writing by us.
The reimbursement of travel expenses and payments of accommodation allowance and daily
allowance (see below) are made on request and in accordance with the Commission Rules on
the reimbursement of expenses of experts (see the annex of Commission Decision
C(2007)5858).
Travel expenses
74EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If your contract includes activities involving travel, expenses are refunded for this travel -
normally between the address indicated in the contract (the address registered in your expert
profile) and the meeting venue indicated in Article 3.2 of the contract. If you exceptionally need
to travel to or from a different location than the address in the contract, you need our explicit
agreement prior to purchasing your tickets.
You should book your travel as soon as possible to keep costs reasonable, but you should NOT
book your travel before your contract has been signed by both Parties.
Accommodation and daily allowances
We will also pay accommodation allowances and daily allowances:
• accommodation allowance is EUR 100 per night
• daily allowance is a flat rate of EUR 92 to cover all expenditure at the place where
the meeting/work is held, including meals and local transport (bus, tram, metro, taxi,
parking, motorway tolls, etc.) as well as travel and accident insurance
• experts who live less than 100km from the meeting venue receive a daily allowance
of EUR 46, and are not eligible to receive the accommodation allowance
• allowances may be increased for disabled experts, see below.
Other expenses
Expenses that you incur as a result of special instructions received in writing from the EU
services, different from the contract terms, may be reimbursed in justified cases on presentation
of supporting documents. Please note that no other expenses will be reimbursed.
Taxation issues
You are obliged to ensure compliance with your national legislation on taxes and social security
law – this is your responsibility. Payments you receive are NOT exempted from national taxes.
However, if you are considered to supply a taxable service under national tax law and you are
registered for VAT as a natural person in an EU Member State, you can benefit from a VAT
exemption certificate for EU payments made under your contract.
Please note that in this case your invoice needs to bear a special indication “VAT exemption
/ European Union / Article 151 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC” (specific incidations are
mandatory for some countries, like Belgium, Luxembourg or Italy).
Further information on the VAT situation can be found in the FAQs on the Funding & Tenders
Portal.
Disabilities
If an expert's disability requires that a person accompany them when travelling, then the
travel expenses of that person will also be refunded upon prior request. The EU services will
also pay accommodation allowances and daily allowances to the accompanying person.
Keeping supporting documents:
You must keep records or other supporting documents for two years from the date of the
last payment made under the contract that the work relates to, when you work as an expert.
The EU services may ask you to provide these documents as evidence that the contract was
carried out correctly and that any expenses claimed are genuine.
75EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
7.3 Experts roles and tasks
If you have registered as an expert and have the required profile, the EU service will contact
you in due course to let you know whether you have been selected. This depends on whether
there are any proposals to be evaluated or projects to be monitored requiring your
particular expertise.
Roles and tasks assigned to experts
As an expert, you can perform a variety of roles and tasks:
1. Evaluators are responsible for evaluating proposals submitted in response to a call for
proposals.
Evaluators may also act as a rapporteur, chair, or vice-chair at consensus discussions
or meetings of panels of evaluators. Rapporteurs are responsible for drafting the
consensus report (CR) of a consensus meeting.
2. Observers provide the EU services with independent advice on the conduct and fairness
of all phases of the evaluation process, on how evaluators apply award criteria, and on
how to improve the procedure.
The observer may attend any meeting held during the proposal evaluation process and
drafts a report on the evaluation session observed.
3. Monitors assist EU services in monitoring the implementation of projects that have
received funding, taking into account work descriptions, reports and deliverables.
All experts' tasks are laid down in their contract and its annexes. See the Model Contract for
Experts for further details.
Proposal-evaluation process
The underlying principles to bear in mind during evaluation are:
• Excellence - projects must demonstrate a high level of quality in relation to the topics
and criteria set out in the calls
• Transparency - funding decisions must be based on clearly defined rules and
procedures, and applicants should receive adequate feedback on the outcome of the
evaluation
• Fairness and impartiality - all proposals must be treated equally and evaluated
impartially on their merits, irrespective of their origin or the identity of the applicants
• Confidentiality - all proposals and related data, knowledge and documents must be
treated in confidence
• Speed and efficiency - proposals should be evaluated and grants awarded and
administered as swiftly as possible, without compromising quality or breaking the rules
Award criteria
The award criteria to be applied by the evaluators are set for each programme in the call
conditions .
Thresholds may vary according to the work programme. For two-stage submission schemes,
thresholds and the maximum overall score may vary between the first and the second stage.
76EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Steps in the Process
The diagram below depicts the main steps of the evaluation process and highlights at which
stages the experts intervene
There are three main phases in the experts' involvement in the evaluation process.
Before starting their work, experts are briefed on evaluation procedures (including remote
evaluation), the topics of the relevant calls for proposals and the terms of their contracts. This
briefing can be done in Brussels or remotely (e.g. web-streaming).
For each proposal, experts presents their evaluation results in an individual evaluation
report (IER), explaining the evaluation scores. Expert evaluators also pre-screen each
proposal (on the basis of the applicant's ethics self-assessment) to see if it raises ethical
issues. All evaluation forms are completed online. This report can be completed and
signed remotely or in Brussels.
In principle, proposals will be evaluated initially by at least three experts (in a number of
cases, five or more). However, for the first stage in two-stage submission schemes and
for low-value grants, only two experts may be involved.
A consensus group is convened in order for all the experts who assessed the proposals
in question to discuss the individual evaluation reports and agree on comments and
scores.
The consensus group discussion is led by a moderator (normally an official from the
concerned EU service), who seeks a consensus and ensures that proposals are evaluated
in a fair manner and in line with the established criteria.
The consensus group discussion results in a consensus report (CR) including
justifications of scores and dissenting views, if any. The moderator is responsible for
ensuring that the consensus report reflects the consensus reached. The report is signed
by the rapporteur and the experts evaluating the proposal discussed.
The discussion usually takes place in Brussels and includes experts who participated in
the individual evaluation. It is also possible to convene a remote consensus group.
Panel review consists of reviewing all the proposals within a call, or part of a call, to:
• ensure that the consensus groups have been consistent in their evaluations;
77EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• if necessary, propose a new set of marks or comments; and
• resolve cases where a consensus could not be reached and a minority view was
recorded in the consensus report.
Exceptionally, in some cases, justified by the specific call circumstances, the outcome of
the consensus group will constitute the final result of the evaluation, and there will be no
panel review. These cases will be signalled in the guidance documents.
The panel review is led by a panel chairperson (normally an official from the concerned
EU service) who ensures fair and equal treatment of the proposals.
The panel review should result in a panel report which includes the evaluation
summary report (ESR) for each proposal, a list of proposals passing all thresholds,
along with a final score, (panel ranked list) and, where necessary, the panel's
recommendations for priority order in the event of equal scores, using the procedure set
out in the work programme. A rapporteur may be appointed to draft the panel report.
Monitoring projects (Technical review)
Projects are monitored to assess the work carried out over a given period and make
recommendations to the EU services. Monitoring may cover scientific, technological and other
aspects of the implementation of the project and Grant Agreement.
The monitoring expert's task is to advise the EU services on how the project has progressed
with regard to:
• the initial work plan
• deliverables
• planned and used resources
• relevance of the objectives
• scientific and industrial quality
• management procedures and methods
• Beneficiaries' contributions, and
• the expected potential impact in scientific, technological, economic, competitive and
social terms, and the plans for the use and dissemination of results.
Depending on the project's complexity and progress, the review may include remote work
entailing reading and analysis of the Grant Agreement, grant decision and other background
information and deliverables and finally drafting the report. The expert may also be required to
attend project meetings at the EU services offices or at the premises of the Beneficiary.
The EU services may require the expert to carry out on-site technical audits to verify whether
critical milestones are being met, or to assist in carrying out research integrity (scientific
misconduct) analysis during implementation.
Types of project monitoring
• Periodic monitoring provided for in the Grant Agreement (generally linked to payment)
• Ad-hoc monitoring, which the EU services can request at any time, where necessary,
and which may involve reviewing financial and technical aspects, or only technical
aspects.
78EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Monitoring process
• Review meeting and assessment - experts read all relevant documents before and
attends the review meeting. They then assess the project on the basis of the written
material and information provided at the meeting. In the event of remote monitoring,
the assessment is based on written documents only.
• Monitoring report - the expert draws up the monitoring report on a project, and the
EU service sends it to the consortium via the Coordinator, but it is not made public. If
more than one expert is involved in project monitoring, they issue a single consolidated
report written by a rapporteur.
• Recommendations - the monitor will also assist the EU services by recommending any
changes that may be required. However, the final decision on recommendations and
changes is taken by the EU services alone.
• Observations - Beneficiaries may comment on the monitoring report within one month
of receiving it.
• Project assessment by the EU services? - taking the experts' formal
recommendations into account, the EU services informs the Coordinator of its decision,
which, however, may depart from the recommendations. It may entail
accepting or rejecting the deliverables
o
allowing the project to continue in its existing form
o
suggesting modifications, or
o
taking steps to terminate the Grant Agreement or to exclude a Beneficiary from
o
taking part.
