IMPORTANT NOTICE
The AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement is a user guide that aims to explain to applicants and
beneficiaries the EU Model Grant Agreements for the EU funding programmes 2021-2027.
Programme specificities are reflected in this document as examples — in so far as they are accepted
as mainstream solutions that can be used by several EU programmes.
The purpose of this document is to help users understand and interpret their Grant Agreements
(GAs). By avoiding technical vocabulary, legal references and jargon, it seeks to help readers find
answers to the practical questions they may come across when setting-up or implementing their
projects.
In the same spirit, the document’s structure mirrors that of the EU Model Grant Agreements (MGAs).
It explains each MGA Article and includes examples where appropriate.
Since all EU MGAs are derived from the same basic model (EU General Model Grant Agreement), the
AGA focuses mainly on this model. Other types of grants will be gradually covered by separate
guidance, in order to be able to cover all specificities, not only the specific explanations on the
contractual text.
Our approach
1. The text of the article appears in a grey text box — to differentiate it from the annotations.
The concepts that are annotated are in bold and underlined.
The annotations to the article are immediately underneath.
Long articles are split into different parts, so the annotations can be placed below the
relevant parts.
Examples are in green.
Lists are in red.
Specific cases and exceptions are in orange.
Programme-specific cases are in purple.
New explanations (compared to the last AGA update) will be marked with: (as from V1.0;
not applicable for the draft versions)
New rules that do not apply to all signed Grant Agreements (but instead only to those signed
after a certain version, e.g. version 3.0), will be marked with: and
2. As the AGA intends to be comprehensive, it will cover all possible options envisaged in the
EU MGAs.
Many of these options may not be relevant to your grant (and will not appear in the Grant
Agreement you sign, or will be marked ‘not applicable’). The chosen options will be
summarised in the Data Sheet of your Grant Agreement.
Versioning
The AGA will be managed as a stable corporate document with versions. Older versions will be
accessible through hyperlinks in the History of Changes table.
Other information
The AGA is limited to the provisions of the EU Model Grant Agreements. For a more general
overview of how EU grants work, see the Online Manual and the programme-specific guidance
published in the Funding & Tenders Portal Reference Documents.
The Portal Reference Documents also contain a comprehensive list of all other reference documents,
for each EU programme (including legislation, work programme and templates).
Terms are explained in the Funding & Tenders Portal Glossary.

I. EU GENERAL MODEL GRANT AGREEMENT (GENERAL
MGA)
INTRODUCTION
General > EU grants regulatory framework
1. EU Regulatory framework for funding programmes — EU Financial Regulation —
EU Programme Regulations — EU grant agreements
EU grants are given through sui generis private law contractual arrangements called ‘EU
grant agreements’.
They govern the relationship between the EU granting authorities and the
beneficiaries/participants in EU grants and set out the respective rules and obligations
concerning the funding and the implementation and of the EU projects.
The grant agreements are embedded in the EU regulatory framework, i.e. EU Financial
Regulation and the sectoral regulations setting up the funding programmes (‘basic acts’ or
‘programme regulations’).
The EU Financial Regulation codifies the procedures for awarding EU funding; the sectoral
regulations contain additional, programme-specific rules on the objectives of each programme,
eligibility, selection procedures, etc.
In September 2024, the Financial Regulation 2018/1046 was recast and replaced by the
Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
The new Regulation 2024/2509 applies to all EU calls for proposals opening as from 30
September 2024.
In addition, the EU grant agreements have been updated and will be used as from mid 2025.
The update has however very limited impact (mainly cross-references to the Financial
Regulation that had to be replaced and a clarification regarding the failure to cooperate with
checks, reviews, audits and investigations as a breach of contract in Articles 28, 30, 31 and 32
of the grant agreements — which was in substance already covered by these provisions also
before the update).
The MGA and AGA have been updated to the new numbering. For your convenience, new
footnotes have been added with references to the old Financial Regulation.
General > Scope – Types of actions – Types of grant agreements?
2. Background and scope — What types of actions are funded by EU grants —
Types of grant agreements
The EU uses different types of grants in its funding programmes (‘programmes’). The EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509 distinguishes between 2 main types: action grants (AG) and
operating grants (OG)1.
In addition, there are simplified grant types which pay only lump sums (LS) or unit costs
(UN)2.
1 See Article 183(2) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23
September 2024 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union (recast) (‘EU Financial
Regulation’) (OJ L, 2024/2509, 26.9.2024) [old Financial Regulation: Article 180(2) Regulation (EU, Euratom)
2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the
general budget of the Union (‘EU Financial Regulation’) (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1).]
10EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Grants are usually given through open calls for proposals, but may sometimes also be
awarded directly without a call. They can be multi- or mono-beneficiary actions.
The General Model Grant Agreement (General MGA) is the grant agreement for EU action
grants (AG), i.e. grants that are funded based on the actual costs incurred by the
beneficiaries.
For guidance on other types of grants, see How to manage your lump sum grants.
This new General MGA has been introduced by the European Commission for the new
generation of programmes under the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027
(new for 2021-2027), in order to ensure simpler and more coherent provisions for all EU
programmes. Programme-specific provisions are grouped in Article 6 and Annex 5; the rest of
the provisions are the same for all programmes.
The new AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement reflects this new structure. Moreover, since a
wide range of programmes is now using the European Commission eGrants IT tools (EU
Funding & Tenders Portal; also called ‘Portal’), the annotations focus on grants managed
through these IT tools. For other aspects, the AGA applies to grant agreements managed
outside these tools (paper).
General > How to set up your project — Consortium composition and roles and responsibilities
3. How to set up your project — Consortium composition and roles and
responsibilities
Capacity to successfully carry out the project:
The Financial Regulation requires that beneficiaries must have the technical and financial
resources needed to carry out their projects (‘operational and financial capacity’)3.
This assessment is project-specific (and the outcome may accordingly vary between calls,
depending on the complexity and nature of the action). What will be checked is if the
participants have sufficient operational and financial capacity to carry out the proposed
action.
The sufficient capacity must be demonstrated in the proposal and be available at the moment
of the implementation of the work (i.e. not necessarily already at the moment of submitting
the proposal or signing the GA, but at least when the work starts). In order to give sufficient
assurance, proposals should show how the resources will be made available when they are
needed.
Examples (acceptable):
1. For an innovative technology call, a Start-up company with no resources at the time of proposal
submission, but with a credible business plan described in the application.
2. SME which, if it gets the grant, plans to double its capacity/staff.
Examples (not acceptable):
1. Consultancy company which submits a proposal where the majority of the work is
subcontracted.
2 See Article 183(3) and 125 Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 180(3) and 125
Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
3 See Article 201 Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 198 Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
11EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. For a call for distribution of support goods in an immediate crisis situation, a start-up with no
experience and no resources at the time of proposal submission.
Different roles in the GA:
Ideally, the project work should be done by the beneficiaries and their affiliated entities
themselves, but if needed, they may involve other partners and rely on outside resources
(purchase new equipment, goods, works or services, subcontract a part of the work or
involve associated partners, etc).
Legally speaking, it is the beneficiaries that remain fully responsible towards the granting
authority (since they are the ones that have signed the Grant Agreement (GA)). For all the other
participants, the obligations under the Grant Agreement are indirect, meaning that the
beneficiaries must ensure that the activities of the other participants are in line with the Grant
Agreement. In case of non-compliance, the granting authority will turn to the beneficiaries to
enforce their obligations.
Depending on the programme and on the type of action, entities can participate in various
roles: as coordinator, beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, in-kind
contributors, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP).
Each role is linked to a set of conditions and legal rights and obligations that are relatively rigid.
Make sure that you chose the appropriate role for everyone. Having the wrong role can cause a
lot of problems later on.
Coordinator vs other beneficiaries
The coordinator is the participant that will be the central contact point (for the granting
authority) and represent the consortium (towards the granting authority). The other
beneficiaries are the other entities that participate as beneficiaries (i.e. also sign the grant).
For mono-beneficiary grants, the mono-beneficiary also has the coordinator role.
Beneficiaries vs affiliated entities
Affiliated entities (new for 2021-2027; in some programmes previously called ‘linked third
parties’) are in practice treated largely like beneficiaries (except that — formally speaking —
they do NOT sign the Grant Agreement).
They must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding as the beneficiaries and
need to have a validated participant identification code (PIC) in the Portal Participant
Register. Annotations in this AGA which refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to affiliated
entities (just like the provisions of the MGA themselves; see also MGA Preamble).
More details on participant registration and PICs are explained in the Online Manual >
Participant Register > Registration and validation of your organisation on the Funding & Tenders
Portal.
Su bcontractors vs suppliers of goods, works and services
The core criterium for distinguishing between subcontracts and contracts/purchases is
whether they concern action tasks as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of
the Grant Agreement).
Subcontracts Purchases
Subcontracts concern the implementation Purchases concern any other contracting

Example (subcontracts): Subcontract to organise a conference that is set as part of the
tasks in Annex 1.
Example (purchases): Contract for an audit certificate on the financial statements; contract
for the translation of documents; contract for the publication of brochures; contract for the
creation of a website that enables the beneficiaries to work together (if creating the website is
just a project management tool and not a separate subcontracted ‘action task’); contract for
organisation of the rooms and catering for a meeting (if the organisation of the meeting is not
a separate subcontracted ‘action task’); contract for hiring IPR consultants/agents needed for
the project.
The same kind of items (e.g. writing materials) can qualify as purchases in one action
(simple consumables for the implementation of the action), but as subcontracting in another
(e.g. if it is an action task to acquire writing materials for a school).
Subcontractors and purchases vs affiliated entities
In contrast to subcontractors, affiliated entities have a link (e.g. legal or capital) with a
beneficiary which goes beyond the implementation of the action.

The eligible cost is the price charged to the The eligible costs are only the costs of the
beneficiary (usually containing a profit affiliated entity, no profit is allowed (neither

The beneficiary must award the contracts
and subcontracts on the basis of best value
for money (or lowest price) and absence of
conflict of interests.
Example (implementation by affiliated entity): Company X and company Y do not control
each other, but they are both fully owned by company Z. Company X is beneficiary in the grant
and company Y implements some of the action tasks described in Annex 1(testing and analysis
of the resistance of a new component under high temperatures).
Contributions against payment vs in-kind contributions (for free)
13EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In some projects, third parties make available some of their resources to a beneficiary
without this being part of their normal economic activity (i.e. seconding personnel,
contributing equipment, infrastructure or other assets, or other goods and services).
This can be done against payment or for free. If against payment, the costs paid can be
charged by the beneficiaries to the action (e.g. A.3 Seconded persons, C.2 Equipment and
C.3 Other goods, works and services); if for free, there are no costs that arise for the
beneficiaries, so nothing can be charged to the action (exception for HE: in-kind contributions
for free can under certain conditions be declared as eligible costs, see Article 6.1).
Example (in-kind contributions (for free)): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university. His salary is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but by the government (the
ministry). According to the secondment agreement, the government does not ask any
reimbursement in exchange (non-cash donation). Since the beneficiary does not incur any
costs, nothing can be charged to the grant. (exception for HE: the beneficiary can declare the
salary costs in its financial statements, even if they are paid by the ministry/government).
Example (contributions against payment): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university. His salary is paid by the government (the ministry) which employs him. According
to the secondment agreement, the beneficiary (the university) has to reimburse the
government an amount corresponding to the paid salary. The reimbursed amount is a cost for
the beneficiary and is recorded as such in its accounts. The beneficiary will declare the amount
reimbursed to the government in its financial statements.
Associated partners vs affiliated entities and third parties giving in-kind contributions
A new type of participant has been introduced (new for 2021-2027), the so-called associated
partners. They may implement action tasks, but in contrast to affiliated entities they do not
need to have a capital or legal link to a beneficiary and cost incurred by associated partners
can NOT be declared as eligible cost. In contrast to third parties giving in-kind contributions,
the associated partners are fully named in the Grant Agreement and may implement
important action tasks by themselves.
Entities that do not request funding or are not eligible for funding may participate in EU
actions as associated partners, for example out of interest in contributing to the objectives of
the action, gaining visibility, or participating due to ongoing (R&D) cooperation with a
beneficiary.
As with any other participant that does not sign the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries need
to ensure (e.g. through the consortium agreement) that associated partners implement their
action tasks in accordance with the Grant Agreement.
Where possible, associated partners should be linked to a specific beneficiary.
Combination of roles
In principle, each person or entity should only participate in a single role in an action. This is
to avoid any potential conflicts of interest and ensure clear allocation of rights and obligations
as well as certainty on cost eligibility.
A combination of roles within the same action is only possible in the following very limited
cases provided it is not used in a way to circumvent rules of the Grant Agreement:
- Associated partner + third party giving in-kind contribution: If necessary for
the implementation of the action, associated partners implementing their own tasks
may also support beneficiaries and affiliated entities in the implementation of their
tasks by providing in-kind contributions.
- Associated partner/third party giving in-kind contribution/ + subcontractor:
It is in principle possible for an associated partner or a third party giving in-kind
contributions in support of certain parts of the action to also compete for subcontracts
for other parts of the same action. If, in accordance with the criteria for awarding
14EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
subcontracts (best value for money or lowest price, no conflict of interest), an
associated partner or a third party already giving in-kind contributions gives the best
offer, it may also participate as a subcontractor.
- Recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) + any other role:
Recipients of financial support to third parties must normally be third parties to the
agreement. Beneficiaries are not allowed to provide financial support under the Grant
Agreement to themselves or their affiliated entities. However, certain exceptions may
be made if explicitly allowed in the call conditions/Grant Agreement and justified in
the DoA Annex 1 (e.g. for HE Co-funded Partnerships, see Annex 5 > HE Co-funded
Partnerships). By contrast, in the case of third parties providing in-kind contributions
or subcontractors, assuming that the financial support is not directly related to their
tasks, they are considered third parties to the agreement and may therefore in
principle receive financial support to third parties under the conditions set out in the
Grant Agreement.

If only one beneficiary signs the Grant Agreement (‘mono-beneficiary grant’), all provisions referring to the
‘coordinator’ or the ‘beneficiaries’ will be considered — mutatis mutandis — as referring to the beneficiary.
The parties referred to above have agreed to enter into the Agreement.
By signing the Agreement and the accession forms, the beneficiaries accept the grant and agree to implement
the action under their own responsibility and in accordance with the Agreement, with all the obligations and
terms and conditions it sets out.
The Agreement is composed of:

1. Consortium: Coordinator — Beneficiaries — Affiliated entities — Other
participants
In EU grants, the consortium is normally composed of the key project participants, i.e.
typically the coordinator and the other beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated
partners. Sometimes also subcontractors and third parties that contribute to the action are
included.
The coordinator is the beneficiary which is the central contact point for the granting
authority and represents the consortium (towards the granting authority). For mono-
beneficiary grants, the mono-beneficiary also has the coordinator role.
The signature arrangements are the following:
− the coordinator directly signs the Grant Agreement
− the other beneficiaries sign the Grant Agreement by signing the Accession Form (see
Article 40). Only beneficiaries sign the Accession Form. Affiliated entities, associated
partners etc. do NOT sign the Accession Form.
Amendments to the GA, if any, will be signed by the coordinator on behalf of the other
beneficiaries.
The division of roles and responsibilities within the consortium are explained in Article 7.
Generally speaking:
− the coordinator must coordinate and manage the grant, including distribution of
payments received from the granting authority, and is the central contact point for the
granting authority
− the beneficiaries must collectively together contribute to a smooth and successful
implementation of the project (i.e. implement their part of the action properly, comply
with their own obligations under the Grant Agreement and support the coordinator in
his obligations).
The beneficiaries are bound by the grant terms and conditions. This means that they must:
18EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− carry out the action as described in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of the
Grant Agreement) and
− comply with all the other provisions of the Grant Agreement and all the applicable
provisions of EU, international and national law (including general principles, such as
fundamental rights, values, and ethical principles).
The involvement of other participants which do not sign the Grant Agreement (affiliated
entities, associated partners, subcontractors, etc) varies depending on the role. Since there is
no formal contractual link with them, their obligations will always be enforced through the
responsible beneficiaries.
The consortium set-up must follow the roles in the Grant Agreement.
Participants should be attributed their roles according to their real contribution to the project.
The main actors should be the beneficiaries or affiliated entities. All other roles should be
complementary.
This means for instance:
− affiliated entities — are allowed to fully participate in the action; they are treated like
beneficiaries for most issues (including cost eligibility); they do not however have
access to the Portal My Area section (see Article 36); annotations in this AGA which
refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to affiliated entities (just like the provisions of
the MGA themselves; see also MGA Preamble)
− subcontracting — beneficiaries/affiliated entities may NOT subcontract tasks to other
beneficiaries/affiliated entities
− coordinator tasks — the coordinator tasks listed in the Grant Agreement may NOT be
subcontracted (they can only be delegated, under certain circumstances, to an entity
with ‘authorisation to administer’ or in the case of ‘sole beneficiaries’ within the
meaning of Article 190(2) of the Financial Regulation 2024/25094; see Article 7).
For an overview on the different types of third parties and their roles, rights and obligations
under the Grant Agreement, see the table in Article 7.
If you are an assocation with members who will implement some of the action activities (or an
European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) or joint venture), you should make sure that the
members participate as affiliated entities, so that they will be able to charge their costs to the
project. Otherwise these costs will NOT be eligible.
2. Name and address — Legal entity data
The legal entity data (legal name, address, legal representatives, etc) of the beneficiaries
comes from the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register (former ‘Beneficiary Register’).
This data will be automatically used for all communications concerning the grant (see Article
36) and will also be used in case you are applying for other EU grants, prizes or tenders (if
managed through the Portal).
The beneficiaries (via their legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)) must keep their data in
the Participant Register up-to-date at all times including after the end of the grant (see Article
19).

1 If the RAO decides to set specific rules, they must be set out in the call and take into account the value of the contracts and the relative size
of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk (proportionality). Specific rules may only be set for the award of
contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000.
2 This is a standard obligation for all EU grants. It may be unselected only for actions where subcontracting is a key/large part of the action
(e.g infrastructure projects; technical assistance, statistical programmes, etc).

1. Data Sheet
The Data Sheet shows ALL options in the Grant Agreement (i.e. all provisions in the terms
and conditions that are flagged as options — marked by red or green brackets).
The Data Sheet uses the IT labels that are used by the Portal Grant Management System for
the automatic generation of the contracts.
These labels do NOT necessarily reflect the precise legal provisions and must therefore ALWAYS
be cross-checked with the full text of the corresponding provision in the terms and conditions
Examples:
1. The options ‘Actual costs/Unit or actual cost’ for travel and subsistence in the Data Sheet are linked to the
corresponding Options in Article 6.2.C.1. Thus, ‘Unit or actual costs’ does NOT mean that the beneficiaries
can freely choose which cost form to use. The cost form to be used is prescribed by the conditions in Article
6.2.C.1.
2. The options ‘Yes/No’ for VAT in the Data Sheet are linked to the Options in Article 6.3(viii). Thus, ‘Yes’
means eligible under the conditions set out in that provision (Article 6.3(viii)); ‘No’ means always ineligible.
Red options are options which have been selected at programme- or type of action-level.
Green options are options that are selected either at call- or project-level.

ARTICLE 1 — SUBJECT OF THE AGREEMENT
This Agreement sets out the rights and obligations and terms and conditions applicable to the grant awarded
[OPTION for SGAs: under Framework Partnership Agreement No [insert number] — [insert acronym]] for
the implementation of the action set out in Chapter 2.
1. Subject of the Grant Agreement
The Grant Agreement sets out the rights and obligations of each party and the terms and
conditions of the grant that beneficiaries must comply with when implementing the action
(i.e. the project).
Grants are public funding in form of donation (i.e. a free, non-reimbursable contribution). The
EU donates to actions because it is a way to incentivise activities that are in the public policy
interest. It is a positive way to support and involve citizens and encourage broad cooperation
across borders without taking ownership in the action.
The granting authority is NOT procuring your work, goods or services, nor is your project
‘done for the European Commission’ or any other EU granting authority.

CHAPTER 2 ACTION
General > Article 3 — Action
ARTICLE 3 — ACTION
ARTICLE 3 — ACTION
The grant is awarded for the action [insert project number] — [insert acronym] (‘action’), as described in
Annex 1.
[OPTION for programmes with linked actions: [OPTION if selected for the grant16: This action is linked to
the action(s) set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 1) (‘linked actions’).]]
16 Linked actions cover all types of joint/combined/coordinated actions, where the action implementation should be linked to another action
(e.g. Horizon complementary grants, Horizon joint actions; Horizon MSCA SNLS grants, EDIDP COFUND, JU implementing grants,
etc.).
1. Actions
The grant is awarded to allow the consortium to implement the action as described in the
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement (i.e. the project).
Depending on the EU programme under which the grant is awarded, your action may belong
to a specific type of action that is mentioned in the call conditions (e.g. Project Grants, Lump
Sum Grants, Infrastructure Grants, Grants for Procurement, Coordination and Support
Actions, etc).
2. Linked actions
Linked actions are used when the granting authority wishes to establish a formal link between
your action and other activities, that may for example complement, precede or succeed your
project.
The linked action is identified in the Grant Agreement (see Data Sheet, Point 1) and may
refer to any formally set-up activity, such as other EU grants, but also grants from EU
Member States or international organisations, blended finance, or activities carried out under
procurement contracts, etc.
The beneficiaries of both actions must have arrangements, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly. If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet,
Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written collaboration agreement (or, if the
consortia are identical, as part of their consortium agreement; see Article 7).
Specific cases (linked actions):
EU Synergy actions — When projects are part of EU ‘Synergy calls’ (i.e. jointly coordinated
calls that pursue common policy objectives and allow for the combination of funding), they
will always be flagged as ‘Synergy actions’ and benefit from the special cost eligibility rules in
Article 6.3. Other actions (not part of a ‘Synergy call’) can be flagged by the granting
authority as ‘Synergy action’ on request. This is typically needed if an action should benefit
from different combined EU grants. In this case, the beneficiaries must inform both granting
authorities so that they can take measures to prevent double funding. For details, see Article
6.3.
32EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 4 — Duration and starting date
ARTICLE 4 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE
ARTICLE 4 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE
The duration and the starting date of the action are set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 1).
1. Action starting date
The action starting date is fixed in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement.
It is usually the first day of the month following the grant signature. But the parties can also
agree to a fixed starting date (if justified during grant preparation, e.g. conference that must
take place on a specific date).
The fixed starting date should normally be in the future (after grant signature) but it is
possible to propose an earlier starting date (retroactive).
Be however aware that by starting the action before signing the GA, you risk that the starting
date will not be accepted by the granting authority (which will assess the compliance with
applicable rules) or that the grant will not be signed, and no costs will be eligible (e.g. for
activities implemented before signature of the grant). Conversely, starting dates far in the
future affect normally also the timing of your (first) pre-financing payment.
The action starting date can normally NOT be before the submission of the proposal —
unless the Programme Regulation (basic act) allows this or in cases of emergency, e.g. for
humanitarian aid and civil protection, for urgencies in the veterinary or phytosanitary domain, etc.
The starting date will also affect the eligibility of costs (see Article 6.1(a)(ii)).
2. Action duration
The action duration is fixed in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement.
It usually comes from your proposal (based on the call conditions) and is expressed as a
number of months, running from the action starting date.
The action end date shown in the system is the date that is automatically calculated from the
starting date (starting date + months of duration).
The action duration relates only to the period during which the action tasks (set out in Annex 1)
are implemented. This is NOT the same as project closure (i.e. final payment) or the end of the
Grant Agreement. After the action end date, the beneficiaries still have to submit their final report
and the granting authority will have to make the payment of the balance. Moreover, certain
obligations under the Grant Agreement continue even afterwards (e.g. keeping supporting
documents in case of audits, continue to use certain equipment for the same objective, maintain
the website of the project if required, etc).

CHAPTER 3 GRANT
General > Article 5 — Grant
ARTICLE 5 — GRANT
ARTICLE 5 — GRANT
5.1 Form of grant
The grant is an action grant17 which takes the form of a [budget-based][activity-based] mixed actual cost
grant (i.e. a grant based on actual costs incurred, but which may also include other forms of funding, such as
unit costs or contributions, flat-rate costs or contributions, lump sum costs or contributions or financing not
linked to costs).
5.2 Maximum grant amount
The maximum grant amount is set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 3) and in the estimated budget (Annex 2).
[OPTION for programmes with contingency reserve: [OPTION if selected for the call: The maximum grant
amount can be raised at the end of the action, by activating the contingency reserve set out in the Data Sheet
(see Point 3).]]
5.3 Funding rate
[OPTION 1 for programmes with single funding rate (per action): The funding rate for costs is […]% of the
action’s eligible costs. Contributions are not subject to any funding rate.]
5.4 Estimated budget, budget categories and forms of funding
The estimated budget for the action is set out in Annex 2.
It contains the estimated eligible costs and contributions for the action, broken down by participant [OPTION
for programmes with activity-based budget:, type of activity] and budget category.
Annex 2 also shows the types of costs and contributions (forms of funding)19 to be used for each budget
category.
If unit costs or contributions are used, the details on the calculation will be explained in Annex 2a.
5.5 Budget flexibility
The budget breakdown may be adjusted — without an amendment (see Article 39) — by transfers (between
participants and budget categories), as long as this does not imply any substantive or important change to the
description of the action in Annex 1.
However:
- changes to the budget category for volunteers (if used) always require an amendment
- changes to budget categories with lump sums costs or contributions (if used; including financing not
linked to costs) always require an amendment
- changes to budget categories with higher funding rates or budget ceilings (if used) always require an
amendment
- addition of amounts for subcontracts not provided for in Annex 1 either require an amendment or
simplified approval in accordance with Article 6.2
- other changes require an amendment or simplified approval, if specifically provided for in Article
6.2
- [OPTION 1 by default: flexibility caps: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes with flexibility
caps: [OPTION 1 by default: flexibility caps: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the call:
flexibility caps: [transfers between budget categories of more than [20%][[…%]] [of the total costs
and contributions][per budget category] set out in Annex 2 require an amendment][[other]]]] .
17 For the definition, see Article 183(2)(a) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: ‘action grant’ means an EU grant to finance “an action
intended to help achieve a Union policy objective”.
19 See Article 125 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
34EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Form of grant
EU grants are normally ‘budget-based mixed actual cost’ grants (meaning grants, broken
down by budget categories and participants, and based on actual costs incurred and other
simplified forms of funding (e.g. normally unit costs for SME owners/natural person
beneficiaries and volunteers, if applicable and flat rate costs for indirect costs).
However, depending on the programme and on the type of action, grants may also be:
− pure actual cost grants (e.g. some operating grants)
− pure lump sum grants
− pure unit grants
− ‘activity-based mixed actual cost’ grants, i.e. broken down by budget categories as
well as by activities
or
− any other combination of costs and/or contributions.
For guidance on other types of grants, see How to manage your lump sum grants.
Ge neral > Article 5.2 Maximum grant amount
2. Maximum grant amount
The maximum grant amount set out in this Article defines the maximum amount of funding
that the granting authority has available for the grant. It is a ceiling and not necessarily the
‘final grant amount’ and in any case not a ‘price’ due to the beneficiaries. It can NOT be
exceeded, e.g. to accommodate higher or anticipated cost.
The maximum grant amount can NOT be increased — even if the eligible costs of the action
are higher than planned.
Specific cases (maximum grant amount):
Contingency reserve (RELEX) — In some programmes, the maximum grant amount
foreseen in the award decision may go beyond the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 to
accommodate a ‘contingency reserve’. In this case, the maximum grant amount in Annex 2
can be raised during the action by activating the contingency reserve (— up to the maximum
grant amount set out in the award decision). This requires the agreement of the granting
authority and must be requested through an amendment (see Article 39).
General > Article 5.3 Funding rate
3. Funding rate
EU grants are normally subject to ‘co-financing’ or ‘co-funding’, meaning that the EU granting
authority does only provide a part of the funding of the action and the remaining parts must
be financed from the beneficiaries’ own resources, income generated by the action (e.g. by
selling results), or financial or in-kind contributions from third parties (e.g. grants from
national or private funding programmes). As such, the EU grants are normally subject to a
single funding rate for the entire action — which is expressed as a fixed percentage and
announced in the call conditions. Through the application of the funding rate (a percentage of
the eligible cost), co-financing is ensured as the remaining no eligible cost will need to be
35EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
covered from other sources. Normally the granting authority does not require any further
information on the sources of co-financing, unless specifically requested for the action.
For some programmes and types of action (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, I3, ERDF-TA, SMP,
RELEX), there are however several funding rates inside the project. These may depend on:
− the type of beneficiaries (e.g. SMEs; for-profit or non-profit legal entities, place of
establishment etc)
− the type of cost categories to be covered (e.g. FSTP)
− the type of activities to be performed (for activity-based grants).
Where funding rates are based on the type of beneficiary, beneficiaries and their affiliated
entities will be assessed separately. The funding rate of a beneficiary does NOT condition the
funding rate of its affiliated entities.
Example: The beneficiary is entitled to a 70 % funding rate, it has an affiliated entity entitled to a
funding rate of 100 %. The cost incurred by the affiliated entities will be funded at 100 % —
despite the lower funding rate of the beneficiary to which it is linked.
In order to avoid abuse, the budget flexibility is restricted. Changes that would entail a higher
funding rate (e.g. change between budget category or activity, relocation of budget (and
tasks) to a beneficiary with higher rate) are always subject to an amendment. Changes
between beneficiaries with different funding rates will be monitored closely, to ensure that
no disproportionate amount of tasks and budget is transferred from the beneficiary to its
affiliated entity or vice versa in order to unduly profit from funding rate differences (budget
transfers that result in substantive or important changes, i.e. changes that would also affect
the description of the action in Annex 1, are subject to a mandatory amendment).
Conditions for the funding rate must normally be complied with throughout the action.
Thus, a change of activity, type of beneficiary, etc. affecting the conditions for the funding rate,
would also require a change of the funding rate (including specific increases or bonuses based on
pre-set conditions) in line with the original call conditions.
General > Article 5.4 Estimated budget, budget categories and forms of funding
4. Estimated budget
The estimated budget of the action is calculated on the basis of the estimated eligible costs
and — if applicable —contributions submitted by the consortium, and is annexed to the Grant
Agreement (Annex 2).
The estimated budget also determines the maximum grant amount for each
beneficiary/affiliated entity and for the action as a whole (see above).
5. Budget categories and forms of funding
The budget categories are listed in Article 6.2 and reflected, for each programme and type
of action, in the budget table in Annex 2.
The standard budget categories which usually apply are the following:
− Personnel costs
− Costs for employees (or equivalent)
− Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract
− Costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment
− Costs for SME owners/beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary (not
all programmes)
36EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− Costs for volunteers’ work (not all programmes)
− Costs for other personnel categories (only SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
− Subcontracting costs
− Purchase costs
− Travel costs, accommodation costs and subsistence costs (all programmes
except RFCS, CCEI)
− Equipment costs
− Costs of other goods, works and services
− Other cost categories
− Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (all programmes except RFCS, EUAF,
CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM)
− Internally invoiced goods and services (only HE, DEP and EDF)
− Indirect costs
Depending on the EU programme and on the the type of action, additional programme-
specific budget categories may apply, for instance:
− HE Access to research infrastructure costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_RI)
− HE PCP/PPI procurement costs (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_PCP/PPI)
− HE ERC additional funding (see Article 6.2.D.X HE_ERC_Additional funding)
− CEF Studies (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Studies)
− CEF Synergetic elements (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Synergetic elements)
− CEF Works in outermost regions (see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Works in outermost regions)
− CEF Land purchase ( see Article 6.2.D.X CEF_Land purchase)
− LIFE Land purchase (see Article 6.2.D.X LIFE_Land purchase)
− AMIF EMN ad hoc queries (see Article 6.2.D.X AMIF_EMN ad hoc queries)
These budget categories may be cost-based (actual costs, unit costs, flat-rate costs, lump
sum costs, costs according to usual cost accounting practices) or contribution-based, i.e.
fixed by the granting authority on the basis of a cost-related methodology including e.g.
indirect cost (unit contribution, lump sum contribution, flat-rate contribution) or a non-cost
related methodology (financing not linked to cost). Which of these forms of funding applies,
is shown, for each budget category, in the estimated budget (Annex 2).
If unit costs or contributions are used, the details on the calculation will be explained in
Annex 2a of the Grant Agreement.
General > Article 5.5 Budget flexibility
6. Budget transfers (budget flexibility)
The budget in Annex 2 is an estimation. The budget is therefore in principle flexible (with
certain exceptions, see below).
37EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
A transfer can NOT lead to an increase of the maximum grant amount.
Moreover, you should be aware that the budget table is considered by the granting authority
to reflect the actual situation and may therefore be the basis for certain decisions, such as the
calculation of amounts to be offset from (pre-financing) payments for beneficiaries that have
outstanding debts to the Commission (see Article 22).
As a general principle, beneficiaries may transfer budget among themselves, between
affiliated entities or between budget categories (without requesting an amendment; see
Article 39) and — at the time of reporting — declare costs that are different from the
estimated budget provided that the action remains in line with the description of the action in
Annex 1 (if this is not the case, an amendment is needed, under the conditions of Article 39).
If the incurred eligible costs during the action implementation turn out to be lower than the
estimated eligible costs, the difference can thus be allocated to another beneficiary or
another budget category. The amount reimbursed for the other beneficiary/other budget
category (to which the budget transfer is intended) may thus be higher than planned.
Example: The estimated budget includes personnel costs of EUR 60 000 for beneficiary A and EUR
75 000 for beneficiary B. However, at the end of the action, the actual personnel costs of beneficiary
A are EUR 75 000 due to an increase in salaries or to the need to employ additional personnel to
carry out the tasks mentioned in Annex 1 while the actual personnel costs of beneficiary B are EUR
60 000. This may be acceptable provided the additional costs of beneficiary A fulfil the eligibility
requirements of Article 6 and up to the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 (at the level of the
action).
The following changes always require an amendment:
− changes to the description of the action in Annex 1
− changes to the budget category for volunteers (if used)
− changes to budget categories with lump sums costs or contributions (if used; including
financing not linked to costs)
− changes to budget categories or activities with higher funding rates or budget ceilings
(if used)
− activation of the contingency reserve (where foreseen in the Grant Agreement).
The following require either an amendment or a simplified approval procedure:
− addition of amounts for subcontracts not provided for in Annex 1
− other changes in certain specific cost categories, if specifically provided for in Article
6.2.
Best practice: In case of doubt, the coordinator should consult the granting authority on
whether a change requires an amendment or — at least — a simplified approval procedure.
Specific cases (grant)
Simplified approval procedure (general)— For some cases and types of cost indicated,
the Grant Agreement provides for simplified approval procedures, meaning that beneficiaries
can ask for an ex post approval by the granting authority to accept costs which have been
incurred, but were not planned in the estimated budget. For such simplified approval, they
must declare the costs in question in the next periodic report and flag and justify them.
Simplified approval is however at the full discretion of the granting authority. This means that
the beneficiaries bear the risk that the costs might not be approved at interim or final
payment-stage later on.
Flexibility caps — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, transfers between
budget categories going beyond a certain threshold percentage require an amendment. In
38EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
this case, unauthorised changes going beyond the threshold may be rejected (cost rejection,
applied to beneficiaries concerned/equally among the consortium members).
Financial support to third parties (FSTP) — A transfer from the budget category of
financial support to third parties to any other category usually implies a significant change to
the nature of the action and often requires also changes to the description of the action.
Therefore, such a transfer normally requires an amendment of the Grant Agreement.

6.1 General eligibility conditions
ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
In order to be eligible, costs and contributions must meet the eligibility conditions set out in this Article.
6.1 General eligibility conditions
The general eligibility conditions are the following:
(a) for actual costs:
(i) they must be actually incurred by the beneficiary
(ii) they must be incurred in the period set out in Article 4 (with the exception of costs relating
to the submission of the final periodic report, which may be incurred afterwards; see
Article 21)
(iii) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(iv) they must be incurred in connection with the action as described in Annex 1 and necessary
for its implementation
(v) they must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts
in accordance with the accounting standards applicable in the country where the
beneficiary is established and with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices
(vi) they must comply with the applicable national law on taxes, labour and social security and
(vii) they must be reasonable, justified and must comply with the principle of sound financial
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency
(b) for unit costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the units must:
- be actually used or produced by the beneficiary in the period set out in Article 4
(with the exception of units relating to the submission of the final periodic report,
which may be used or produced afterwards; see Article 21)
- be necessary for the implementation of the action and
(iii) the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records
and documentation (see Article 20)
(c) for flat-rate costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the costs or contributions to which the flat-rate is applied must:
- be eligible
- relate to the period set out in Article 4 (with the exception of costs or contributions
relating to the submission of the final periodic report, which may be incurred
afterwards; see Article 21)
40EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(d) for lump sum costs or contributions (if any):
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2 and Annex 2
(ii) the work must be properly implemented by the beneficiary in accordance with Annex 1
(iii) the deliverables/outputs must be achieved in the period set out in Article 4 (with the
exception of deliverables/outputs relating to the submission of the final periodic report,
which may be achieved afterwards; see Article 21)
(e) for unit, flat-rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to usual cost accounting practices (if
any):
(i) they must fulfil the general eligibility conditions for the type of cost concerned
(ii) the cost accounting practices must be applied in a consistent manner, based on objective
criteria, regardless of the source of funding
(f) for financing not linked to costs (if any), the results must be achieved or the conditions must be
fulfilled as described in Annex 1.
In addition, for direct cost categories (e.g. personnel, travel & subsistence, subcontracting and other direct
costs) only costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed to it
directly are eligible. They must not include any indirect costs (i.e. costs that are only indirectly linked to the
action, e.g. via cost drivers).
[OPTION for programmes with in-kind contributions eligible: In-kind contributions provided by third
parties free-of charge may be declared as eligible direct costs by the beneficiaries which use them (under the
same conditions as if they were their own, provided that they concern only direct costs and that the third
parties and their in-kind contributions are set out in Annex 1 (or approved ex post in the periodic report, if
their use does not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; ‘simplified approval procedure’).]
1. Eligible costs
The grant can only reimburse eligible costs (and, where applicable, contributions; see Article
6.2.F), i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific conditions set out in this Article.
Therefore, beneficiaries/affiliated entities must enter ONLY eligible costs into the estimated
budget (see Article 5.4), and later on into the financial statements (see Article 21). If
ineligible costs are declared, they will be rejected (see Article 27).
Article 6.1 lists the general eligibility conditions for each form of funding (actual costs, unit,
flat-rate, lump sum, costs according to usual cost accounting practices, financing not linked
to costs); Article 6.2 refers to the specific eligibility conditions for each budget category.
Cost eligibility is NOT the same as beneficiary/action eligibility. The latter are normally
checked upstream (before grant signature/amendment), in order to make sure that only eligible
beneficiaries/actions are selected for a grant. Loss of beneficiary/action eligibility during an ongoing
grant normally leads to termination or change of status (see Articles 32 and 39); costs become
automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility.
For a consolidated list of eligibility issues relating to specific situations/legal framework in
individual countries, see AGA — List of country-specific issues.
41EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. General eligibility conditions for actual costs
In order to be eligible, actual costs must be:
− actually incurred by the beneficiary/affiliated entity, i.e.:
− real and not estimated, budgeted or imputed and
− definitively and genuinely borne by the beneficiary/affiliated entity (not by any
other entity)
− incurred during the action duration, i.e. the generating event that triggers the costs
must take place during the action duration set out in the Data Sheet.
If costs are invoiced or paid later than the end date, they are eligible only if the debt
existed already during the action duration (supported by documentary evidence) and
the final cost are known at the moment of the final report.
Example: Costs of services or equipment supplied to a beneficiary may be invoiced and paid
after the end date of the action, e.g. because of warranty periods, if the services or equipment
were used by the beneficiary during the action duration. By contrast, costs of services or
equipment supplied after the end of the action (or after GA termination) are normally not
eligible.
− entered as eligible costs in the estimated budget, under the relevant budget
category in Annex 2
This requirement is in practice automatically ensured by the IT system, since the
financial statements mirror the budget categories that are available for the estimated
budget. The only thing you need to pay attention to, is whether all the special cost
categories (visible in the estimated budget and financial statements for the
programme) are really eligible under the specific call you applied for (e.g. financial
support to third parties (FSTP), etc; see call conditions). If not, you should leave those
columns empty and NOT enter any costs (they are ineligible and will be rejected).
The requirement also has no impact on budget flexibility; costs may be transferred
between beneficiaries and eligible budget categories without amending the Grant
Agreement, under the conditions set out in Article 5.5.
− connected to the action and necessary for its implementation as described in
Annex 1, i.e. to achieve the action’s objectives
The grant cannot be used to finance activities other than those approved by the
granting authority.
Examples:
1. The activities of the project cost less than foreseen so the beneficiary decides to conduct
additional activities including for example hiring additional staff, organising an additional event,
renewing office equipment. Additional activities regularly require a change of the description of
the action (Annex 1). To be eligible, such reallocation of ‘savings’ need to be pre-discussed with
the granting authority and may regularly require an amendment.
2. Activities that violate the Grant Agreement (e.g. activities that are against the call conditions,
against applicable law, against EU values, etc.) can never be necessary for the implementation
of the action and therefore any cost related to such activities do not fulfil the general eligibility
conditions.
− identifiable and verifiable, i.e. come directly from the beneficiary/affiliated entity’s
accounts, be directly reconcilable with them and supported by documentation
The records and supporting documents must show the actual costs of the work, i.e.
what was actually paid or recorded in the beneficiary’s profit and loss accounts (see
Article 20).
42EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs must be calculated according to the applicable accounting rules of the country in
which the beneficiary is established and according to the beneficiary’s usual cost
accounting practices.
Example: If a beneficiary always charges a particular cost as an indirect cost, it must do so
also for EU and Euratom grants, and should not charge it as a direct cost.
Be aware however, that the usual cost accounting practices may NOT be used as an
excuse for non-compliance with other Grant Agreement provisions. You must bring
your usual cost accounting practices in line with the Grant Agreement (e.g. conditions
for calculating personnel costs; conditions for charging depreciation costs, etc.).
− in compliance with applicable national laws on taxes, labour and social security
and
− reasonable, justified and must comply with the principles of sound financial
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency (i.e. be in line with
good housekeeping practice when spending public money and not be excessive).
‘Economy’ means minimising the costs of resources used for an activity (input), while
maximising quality; ‘efficiency’ is the relationship between outputs and the resources
used to produce them.
Examples:
1. The beneficiary may NOT increase the remuneration of its personnel, upgrade its travel policy
or its purchasing rules because of the grant support.
2. Entertainment or hospitality expenses (including gifts, special meals and dinners) are
generally not eligible.
3. Tips which are not obligatory are not eligible. By contrast, in some countries the invoice
includes a certain mandatory amount as payment for the ‘service’. In this case, the amount
may be considered eligible — if the other eligibility conditions are fulfilled.
Double funding risk — A cost item or element can NOT be declared more than once within
the same or another budget category or activity (e.g. cost for internally invoiced goods and
services cannot include cost elements already charged under equipment cost).
Specific cases (actual costs):
Costs related to preparing, submitting and negotiating the proposals — Can generally
NOT be declared as eligible for the action (they are incurred before the action starts), this
includes cost for the preparation of the consortium agreement which should be signed before
the action starts. However, costs related to updating the consortium agreement may be
eligible if incurred during the action duration and in line with the general and specific
eligibility conditions, in particular being necessary for the implementation of the action.
Travel costs for the kick-off/closing meeting — Even if the first leg of the journey takes
place before the action starting date (e.g. the day before the kick-off meeting), the costs may
be eligible, if the meeting is held during the action duration. The same applies for the last leg
of a journey after the end of the action duration for a closing meeting.
Costs for reporting at the end of the action — Costs related to drafting and submitting
the final report are eligible even if they are incurred after the action duration.
Those costs include the cost of certificates on the financial statements (CFS) required by the
Grant Agreement and the cost of participating in a project review carried out by the granting
authority before the submission of the final report. They may also include the cost of
personnel necessary for the project review or to prepare the final report. However, they can
NOT include any other action activities foreseen in the Annex 1 and undertaken after the end
date of the action. For the daily rate to use for such personnel costs, see Article 6.2.A.1.
43EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs to allow for the participation of disabled people (e.g. costs for sign language
interpreters required for dissemination events organised under the action) — Are eligible if
they fulfil the general and specific eligibility conditions listed under Articles 6.1 and 6.2. The
beneficiaries must keep records (see Article 20) to prove in case of an audit, check or review
the actual costs incurred and that they were necessary for the implementation of the action.
Examples:
1. When subcontracting the organisation of an event that is necessary for the implementation of the
action, a beneficiary may select an offer that ensures full accessibility for persons with disability
under the consideration of best value for money instead of the lowest price.
2. When purchasing goods that are necessary for the implementation of the action, a beneficiary
may purchase goods that ensure accessibility for disabled persons even if this entails a higher
expense than comparable goods that do not offer accessibility.
Cost for security measures — Where the implementation of an action requires additional
security measures, costs can be declared under the appropriate cost category (e.g. personnel
costs for security staff, equipment costs for secure rooms, etc) if in line with the general and
specific eligibility conditions, in particular these cost must be directly connected to the action
and necessary for its implementation. Conversely, costs for security not directly connected to
the action (i.e. normal security measures of the beneficiaries with or without the EU action)
are considered to be fully covered by the indirect costs.
3. General eligibility conditions for unit costs
In order to be eligible, unit costs or contributions must be:
− calculated by multiplying the number of actual units used to carry out the work (e.g.
number of hours worked on the action, number of tests performed, etc.) or produced
by the amount per unit
− the number of units must be necessary for the action
− the units must be used or produced during the action duration
and
− the beneficiaries must be able to show the link between the number of units declared
and the work on the action.
The records and supporting documents must show that the number of units declared was
actually used for the action (see Article 20). The actual costs of the work are not relevant.
Example: A beneficiary which is an SME declares for its owner who does not receive a salary 50
days worked for an action in 2022. If there is an audit, the SME beneficiary must be able to show
a record of the number of days worked by the owner for the action.
Specific cases (unit costs):
Costs declared on the basis of the usual cost accounting practices — If this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA: Average personnel
costs; HE, DEP, EDF: Internally invoiced goods and services), the beneficiaries must use unit
costs using their own usual cost accounting practices. In this case: neither the amount per
unit, nor the calculation method will be set out in Annex 2a of the Grant Agreement.
4. General eligibility conditions for flat-rate costs
In order to be eligible, flat-rate costs or contributions must be:
− calculated by applying a flat rate to certain costs (whether actual, unit or lump sum
costs).
Example (7 % flat rate for indirect costs — most programmes):
44EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
A beneficiary is working on an action and uses a daily rate of EUR 240 for personnel costs. The
beneficiary declares as eligible 40 day-equivalents of personnel costs + EUR 1 400 for other
goods, works and services + EUR 1 500 for subcontracting during the first reporting period.
Eligible direct costs: (40 x 240 = 9 600) + 1 400 + 1 500 = 12 500
Eligible indirect cost: 7 % flat-rate of 12 500= EUR 875
Total eligible costs: 12 500 + 875 = EUR 13 375.
Funding rate of 70 % = EUR 9 362,50.
Example (25 % flat rate for indirect costs — HE, EDF):
A beneficiary is working on an innovation action and uses a daily rate of EUR 240 for personnel
costs. The beneficiary declares as eligible 40 day-equivalents of personnel costs + EUR 1 400
for other goods and services + EUR 1 500 for subcontracting during the first reporting period.
Eligible direct costs: (40 x 240 = 9 600) + 1 400 + 1 500 = 12 500
Eligible indirect cost: 25 % flat-rate of 9 600 + 1 400 (not the 1 500 for subcontracting as the
flat-rate does not apply on this specific cost category) = EUR 2 750
Total eligible costs: 12 500 + 2 750 = EUR 15 250
Funding rate of 70 % = EUR 10 675.
The records and supporting documents must show that the costs to which the flat-rate is
applied are eligible (see Article 20). If a flat-rate is applied, the actual indirect costs are not
relevant for the granting authority and it is not necessary to calculate them precisely nor to
keep any supporting document related to these.
5. General eligibility conditions for lump sum costs
In order to be eligible:
− the lump sum costs or contributions must correspond to the amount of lump sum
costs set out in Annex 2
− the work must have been carried out in accordance to Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement
− the output or result triggering payment of the lump sum must have been achieved
during the action duration.
The records and supporting documents must show that the action tasks have been carried
out as described in Annex 1. The actual costs of the work are not relevant.
6. Financing not linked to costs
In order to be eligible:
− the results must be achieved or the conditions must be fulfilled as described in
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement during the action duration.
7. Direct and indirect costs
‘Direct costs’ are specific costs directly linked to the performance of the action and which can
therefore be directly booked to it.
They are:
− either costs that have been caused in full by the activities of the action
− or costs that have been caused in full by the activities of several actions (projects),
the attribution of which to a single action can, and has been, directly measured (i.e.
not attributed indirectly via an allocation key, a cost driver or a proxy).
The beneficiaries must be able to show (with records and supporting evidence) the link to the
action.
45EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Indirect costs’ are costs that cannot be identified as specific costs directly linked to the
performance of the action.
In practice, they are costs whose link to the action can NOT be (or has not been) measured
directly, but only by means of cost drivers or a proxy (i.e. parameters that apportion the total
indirect costs (overheads) among the different activities of the beneficiary).
Which kinds of cost fall under direct or indirect cost depends on the nature of the action
and may therefore vary between programmes and calls.
Where they are reimbursed as flat-rate (e.g. budget category E. Indirect costs in the EU
action grants), you do NOT need to calctulate the indirect costs incurred for the action. They are
covered by the flat-rate and automatically calculated by the IT system.
8. Conditions for eligible in-kind contributions for free (HE)
If eligible under the Grant Agreement (only for HE), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge costs for in-kind contributions made available for free.
What? These cover the costs, which a third party has for resources it contributes to the
action for free (i.e. made available for free for use by the project).
They must be declared under the budget category the beneficiary would use if they were
their own costs (e.g. ‘Personnel costs for seconded persons’, ‘Equipment costs’, ‘Costs for
other goods, works and services’, etc), as actual or unit cost, depending on the rules of the
budget category.
Example: Depreciation costs of equipment contributed free of charge must be declared under
cost category C.2 Equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2).
In addition to the general and specific eligibility conditions of the budget category used
(see Article 6.1 and 6.2), they must be limited to the direct costs incurred by the third party.
Example: A person not receiving a salary and who is the (co)owner of a SME is being seconded
by this SME (third party) to a beneficiary. The direct costs incurred by the SME can be declared
via the SME owner unit cost (daily rate) (see Article 6.2.A.4).
Moreover, the in-kind contribution and the contributing third party must be mentioned in
Annex 1 (simplified approval procedure; see below).
Specific cases (in-kind contributions eligible):
Simplified approval procedure (new in-kind contributions) — If the need for an in-kind
contribution was not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment
in order to introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk
that the granting authority might not approve the new contribution and reject the costs at
interim or final payment-stage later on.
Internal invoicing of goods and services (HE) — For Horizon Europe, the granting
authority can also accept costs that are internally invoiced in the third party providing in-kind
contributions. In this case, they should be declared under cost category D.2 Internally
invoiced goods and services (see Article 6.2.D.2). In that context, the rules on internal
invoicing apply (e.g. indirect (actual) costs of the third party can be included, depending on
the usual cost accounting practices of the third party when calculating its unit cost for
internally invoiced goods and services).

6.2 Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category
For each budget category, the specific eligibility conditions are as follows:
1. Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category.
All programmes follow in principle the basic set of common budget categories from the
General MGA (A. Personnel, B. Subcontracting, C. Purchases and D. Other). However not all
programmes use all the cost categories and some programmes may have special/additional
budget categories.
The eligibility conditions for all currently used budget categories are described in the following
sections.

General > Article 6.2.A.1 Employees
A.1 Employees (all programmes except SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
A.1 Costs for employees (or equivalent) are eligible as personnel costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility
conditions and are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an employment contract (or
equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the action.
They must be limited to salaries [additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: (including net
payments during parental leave)], social security contributions, taxes and other costs linked to the
remuneration, if they arise from national law or the employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and
be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred, in accordance with the following method:
{daily rate for the person
multiplied by
number of day-equivalents worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The daily rate must be calculated as:
{annual personnel costs for the person
divided by
215}
The number of day-equivalents declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 20).
[additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: The actual time spent on parental leave by a
person assigned to the action may be deducted from the 215 days indicated in the above formula.]
The total number of day-equivalents declared in EU grants, for a person for a year, cannot be higher than
215[additional OPTION for programmes with parental leave: minus time spent on parental leave (if any)].
[OPTION A for programmes with standard rules for supplementary payments: The personnel costs may also
include supplementary payments for personnel assigned to the action (including payments on the basis of
supplementary contracts regardless of their nature), if:
- it is part of the beneficiary’s usual remuneration practices and is paid in a consistent manner
whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required
- the criteria used to calculate the supplementary payments are objective and generally applied by the
beneficiary, regardless of the source of funding used.]
[OPTION B for programmes with project-based supplementary payments:
For personnel which receives supplementary payments for work in projects (project-based remuneration), the
personnel costs must be calculated at a rate which:
- corresponds to the actual remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for the time worked by the
person in the action over the reporting period
- does not exceed the remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for work in similar projects funded
by national schemes (‘national projects reference’)
- is defined based on objective criteria allowing to determine the amount to which the person is
entitled
and
- reflects the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay consistently bonuses or supplementary payments
for work in projects funded by national schemes.
The national projects reference is the remuneration defined in national law, collective labour agreement
or written internal rules of the beneficiary applicable to work in projects funded by national schemes.
49EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If there is no such national law, collective labour agreement or written internal rules or if the project-
based remuneration is not based on objective criteria, the national project reference will be the average
remuneration of the person in the last full calendar year covered by the reporting period, excluding
remuneration paid for work in EU actions.]
[additional OPTION for programmes with average personnel costs: If the beneficiary uses average personnel
costs (unit cost according to usual cost accounting practices), the personnel costs must fulfil the general
eligibility conditions for such unit costs and the daily rate must be calculated:
- using the actual personnel costs recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts and excluding any costs
which are ineligible or already included in other budget categories; the actual personnel costs may be
adjusted on the basis of budgeted or estimated elements, if they are relevant for calculating the
personnel costs, reasonable and correspond to objective and verifiable information
and
- according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner, based on
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.]
1. Employees or equivalent (A.1): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS,
CUST/FISC or where declared ineligible in the call conditions), the beneficiaries/affiliated
entities may charge ‘Costs for employees or equivalent’.
This budget category covers the costs for employees or equivalent that worked in the action,
i.e. persons working for the beneficiary on the basis of an employment contract or equivalent
appointing act.
‘Equivalent appointing act’ means the appointing acts of civil servants (who do not sign
employment contracts, but receive official nominations for their posts).
ONLY costs for personnel assigned to the action (i.e. working for the project according to
internal written instructions, organisation chart or other documented management decision) can
be eligible.
Record-keeping — The monthly declaration of days worked in the project correctly signed
(see Article 20) OR reliable time records will normally be sufficient proof of the assignment to the
action — unless there is other contradicting evidence (e.g. the employment contract indicates that
the person was hired to work on another project).
What not? Cost of persons who work for the beneficiary, but NOT with an employment
contract or equivalent appointing act (e.g. staff provided by a temporary work agency,
seconded staff, self-employed persons with a direct contract with the beneficiary).
1.2 Costs for employees (or equivalent) must be declared as:
− actual personnel costs (standard case)
or
50EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− unit costs in accordance with the usual cost accounting practices (‘average personnel
costs’; if option applies in Grant Agreement; option in HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM,
HUMA).
1.3 The costs for employees (or equivalent) must comply with the eligibility conditions set
out in Article 6.2.A.1, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, etc.; see Article 6.1(a) and (b)) and
− be paid in accordance with national law, the collective labour agreement and the
employment contract/equivalent appointing act.
Generally, you may include, for each person concerned, the following:
− fixed salary
− fixed complements, if they are unconditional entitlements for the person (e.g. family
allowance and contributions to medical insurance schemes set out in national law,
complementary pension plan contributions set out in the collective labour agreement
or other binding documents such as staff regulations)
− variable complements, e.g. bonuses, if:
− they are paid based on objective conditions set out, at least, in the internal
rules of the beneficiary
− they are paid in a consistent manner, e.g. not just for actions supported by EU
grants, and
− where applicable, subject to the specific eligibility conditions for supplementary
payments (see specific cases below)
− social security contributions (mandatory employer and employee contributions)
− taxes linked to the remuneration (e.g. income tax withholding)
− other costs and payments linked to the remuneration if they are justified and
registered as personnel costs in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual remuneration
practices (e.g. benefits in kind like company car made available for the private use,
lunch vouchers, accrual for unconditional severance payments mandatory under
national law or other binding documents such as collective labour agreements or other
binding documents such as staff regulations).
You may NOT include:
− any part of the remuneration which has not been an actual cost for you (for example,
salaries reimbursed by a social security scheme or a private insurance in case of long
sick leave or maternity leave)
− payments of dividends to employees (profit distribution in the form of dividends)
− variable complements based on commercial targets or fund raising targets (because
neither incurred in connection with the work of the action, nor necessary for its
implementation)
− arbitrary bonuses (i.e. bonuses which are not paid based on objective conditions set
out, at least, in the internal rules of the beneficiary or bonuses that are not paid in a
consistent manner)
− bonuses that depend on budget availability on the specific project (e.g. paid only if
there are remaining funds in the budget of a project).
51EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Objective conditions’ means conditions which allow to identify who (e.g. what category of
employees) will receive how much (e.g. 5 € extra per hour, 10 % extra salary in each month
of full dedication) in what cases (e.g. time worked as lead researcher in cooperative projects;
an impartial and transparent assessment procedure on performance).
1.4 Calculation of the personnel costs. In most cases you have to calculate your personnel
costs for the action as follows:
Day- Daily rate
equivalents
{actual personnel
costs during the
Personnel Up to a declarable months within the
costs maximum of: reporting period}
{((215 / 12) divided by
multiplied by the
To be calculated
number of months {maximum
per person for
within the reporting declarable day-
each reporting
period
period) multiplied equivalents}
by the working
time factor}
You must do these calculations normally once per reporting period (RP)5 for each person
who worked in the action.
Adaptations may be needed for specific cases, such as project-based remuneration or
average personnel costs, depending on the applicable options in the Grant Agreement
(see specific cases below). Check the Data Sheet of your Grant Agreement, if specific
options apply.
Regarding the calculation of day-equivalents worked in the action:
It is the sum of the day-equivalents actually worked for the action, rounded to the nearest
half-day, and recorded in the monthly declarations or in your time-recording system (if you
have a reliable time-recording system where you record, at least, all the actual time worked
in the action).
For details on the declarations and on how to convert your working time on the action into
day-equivalents, see explanations in Article 20.
5 Alternatively, the calculation may be done separately for each calendar year within the reporting period, if this is
consistently applied. In that case, the ‘number of months within the reporting period’ referred to in the formulas
is to be understood as the number of months of the respective calendar year that are within the reporting
period.
52EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — In case of work on multiple actions per year, the total
number of day-equivalents declared across EU grants for the person can NOT be higher than 215
per calendar year (or the corresponding pro-rata by multiplying 215 with the working time factor),
to avoid double-funding of personnel cost.
Example: In the reporting period form 01/07/2022 to 31/12/2023 the horizontal ceiling per year for a 50%
part-time employee hired on 01/08/2022 would be:
− 2022: (215/12 x 5 [months employed in the RP]) x 0,5 [part-time] = 45 [rounded]
− 2023: (215/12 x 12) x 0,5 = 107,5
Regarding the maximum declarable day-equivalents:
To calculate the daily rate, you first need to determine the maximum declarable day-
equivalents. Since you may not declare more than 100% of your personnel cost, the number
of declarable day-equivalents in each reporting period is capped. The maximum declarable
day-equivalents for each reporting period are calculated as follows:
{((215 / 12) multiplied by the number of months [during which the person is employed] within the
reporting period) multiplied by the working time factor [e.g. 1 for full-time, 0.5 for 50% part time
etc.]}
You will round up or down to the nearest half day-equivalent.
Examples:
The reporting period runs from 01/01/2022 to 30/06/2022 (6 months):
Full-time case: The person is a full-time permanent employee hired in 2020. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 6 [months])
x 1 [full-time] = 107,5
Part-time case: The person is a 50% part-time permanent employee hired in 2020. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 6) x 0.5
[for 50% part-time] = 54
New hire case: The person is a 50% part-time employee hired on 1/06/2022. The maximum
number of day-equivalents to be used in the daily rate formula would be: ((215 / 12) x 1 [only June
2022]) x 0.5 = 9
The number of months used for the calculation either equates the length of the reporting
period, or the length of employment of the person during this reporting period, if the latter is
shorter (e.g. the person is newly hired or no longer employed at any point during the
reporting period).
Example: In the reporting period from 01/01/2022 to 31/03/2023 (i.e. 15 months) you hire a new
person starting in full-time on 16/01/2023, with 2,5 months left in the reporting period. The
number of months for the calculation of the maximum declarable day-equivalents is accordingly 2,5,
not 15. The maximum number of declarable day-equivalents is ((215/12) x 2,5) x 1 = 45 [rounded
to the nearest half day-equivalent].
For the purpose of all personnel cost calculations a month is considered to have 30 days.
Example: In the reporting period form 01/05/2022 to 31/03/2023, you calculate the number of
months to be used when an employee is hired from 05/05/2022 until 20/10/2022:
- May: 26 days as of the day of being hired, i.e. 26 / 30 = 0,87 months
- June-September: 4 months
- October: 20 days until end of employment, i.e. 20 / 30 = 0,67 months
That is for the person in the reporting period: (26 / 30) + 4 + (20 / 30) = 5,54 months.
If the working time factor changes for the person during the reporting period (e.g. a change
from part-time to full-time, change of contract), you calculate the maximum declarable day-
equivalents separately for the months before and after this change of condition and add them
up afterwards to calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period.
Example:
53EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In the reporting period from 01/01/2022 to 31/03/2023, you work full-time in 2022 and 50% part-
time in 2023. You calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents separately for 2022 and 2023
(because conditions have changed).
12 months of full-time work: ((215 / 12) x 12) x 1 = 215
3 months of part-time work: ((215 / 12) x 3) x 0.5 = 26,88
Total: The maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period are therefore 215 + 26,88
= 242 (rounded to the nearest half day-equivalent).
Regarding the calculation of the daily rate:
You have to calculate a daily rate per person for the reporting period. For this, (irrespective
of the situation, i.e. full-time, part-time, partial hire, etc), you have to use the following
formula:
{actual personnel costs during the months within the reporting period}
divided by
{maximum declarable day-equivalents}
The actual personnel costs for the person are those eligible cost recorded in accordance with
your usual cost accounting practice in your (statutory) accounts until the end of the reporting
period for which you are calculating the daily rate.
Example: For a reporting period running from 01/01/2022 until 31/03/2023, to calculate the daily
rate (which you will apply to days worked by the person in the action from 01/01/2022 until
31/03/2023) you will take into account the total personnel costs of the person recorded in your
statutory accounts for the 12 months in 2022 and the 3 months in 2023 (January, February and
March).
If in line with the conditions described above, the personnel costs can include any component
that is legally obligatory by national law, the employment contract, or a similar act. Apart
from taxes and social security contributions, this may also include for example the thirteenth
salary, Christmas pay, etc. These personnel costs may also include supplementary payments
for personnel assigned to the action (including payments on the basis of supplementary
contracts regardless of their nature) if that is your usual remuneration practice for the kind of
work or expertise required and based on objective criteria used regardless of the source of
funding (i.e. not just for the individual EU grant).
Example:
In the reporting period from 01/12/2021 to 31/05/2023 (18 months), the person works 50% part-
time from 01/12/2021 to 31/05/2022 (6 months) and full-time afterwards (12 months). You
calculate the maximum declarable day-equivalents and the daily rate for the reporting period as
follows:
Maximum declarable day-equivalents: Due to a change from part-time to full-time work, you need
to calculate the declarable day-equivalents separately for the period from 01/12/2021 to
31/05/2022 and afterwards. The 6 months of part-time work calculation would be ((215 / 12) x 6) x
0.5 = 53.75 for the part-time which you would have to add up with the result of the calculation for
the 12 months full-time period, which is 215 (i.e. ((215 / 12) x 12) x 1), the maximum number of
declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period would be 53.75 + 215 = 269 (rounded to
nearest half day-equivalent).
Daily rate: After taking into account all eligible elements (salary plus social contribution and taxes
etc.) you recorded in your accounts a total eligible cost of EUR 15 000 personnel costs for working 6
months part-time and EUR 60 000 for 12 months full-time for a total cost of EUR 75 000. The daily
rate for the person is calculated by dividing the personnel costs for the 18 months of work within
the reporting period with the maximum declarable day-equivalents, i.e. EUR 75 000 divided by 269
= EUR 278.81 daily rate.
For personnel costs related to drafting and submitting the final reports incurred after the
action duration (for example related to participation in a project review or to the preparation
of a final report; see Article 6.1),, the daily rate to be used is the one for the last reporting
period. The extra days should simply be added to the days declared in the final reporting
period; there is NO need to calculate a separate daily rate for them. The threshold of
54EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
maximum declarable day-equivalents (see Article 6.2.A.1) will however NOT apply to the
additional days.
Specific cases (costs for employees or equivalent (A.1)):
Teleworking — Teleworking days are accepted if:
− the beneficiary has in place clear rules allowing for teleworking, and
− the teleworked days were in line with those rules (for example: they did not exceed
the maximum days of teleworking allowed by the beneficiary’s rules).
End-of-contract indemnities during the action — If the employment of a person working
on the action ends during the action, the beneficiary may declare cost for end-of-contract
indemnities, if in line with the general and specific eligibility conditions, and in particular that
it is their usual remuneration practices (e.g. required by national law, not just applied for EU
actions, etc) and that these cost have not been included already in the calculation of the daily
rate (e.g. as accrual for unconditional severance payments mandatory under national law).
The eligible part of the indemnity can be charged in the reporting period in which the
employee’s contract ends. Since the entitlement to such indemnities is most often generated
over a period of time longer than the reporting period (or the action), only the part of the
indemnity that corresponds to the time worked by the person on the action can be charged
(i.e. a pro-rata of the indemnity amount in proportion to the time spent on the action). This
pro-rata amount should be added separately on top of the personnel costs calculated on the
basis of the daily rate.
Example:
6 month into the second reporting period (both RPs of 12 month) of an action, a full-time
employee, having worked a total of 154 day-equivalents on the action, stops being employed and
is entitled to an end-of-contract indemnity of EUR 10 750. The employee has accumulated this
indemnity over 5 years (60 months) of employment. You have determined that 3000€ of this are
attributable to the time of employment during the action (taking into account e.g. changes in
salary, indemnity conditions, working time, etc).
To determine the portion of the indemnity chargeable to the grant, you first divide EUR 3000
indemnity (corresponding to the time of employment during the action) by the maximum
declarable day-equivalents of the person during the action, i.e. {EUR 3000 divided by (215
[maximum declarable day-equivalents RP1] + 107,5 [maximum declarable day-equivalents RP2])
} = EUR 9,30 per declarable day-equivalent.
Then you multiply the indemnity amount per day-equivalent with the day-equivalents actually
worked on the action, i.e. EUR 9,30 x 154 [day-equivalents worked on the action in RP1+RP2] =
EUR 1432,20.
Parental leave (option in HE, HUMA) — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement,
days on parental leave during the reporting period may be deducted for the calculation of the
maximum declarable days and the calculation of the daily rate (i.e. by reducing the maximum
declarable day-equivalents in the formulas by the number of day-equivalents spent on
parental leave). Parental leave is any leave directly related to the birth or adoption of a child.
Other leaves or absences can NOT be deducted, including long-term sick leave, breastfeeding
leave and leave to take care of a sick child. The personnel costs used for the calculation of
the daily rate during the reporting period in which the parental leave takes place, may only
contain costs actually incurred by the beneficiary (e.g. exclude any costs already covered by
a national scheme paying the person on parental leave or reimbursing the beneficiary).
Example:
In a reporting period from 01/12/2021 to 31/01/2023 (14 months), an employee working full-time
on the action takes four months of parental leave after the birth of a child, that is 71,67 day-
equivalents (i.e. {((215/12) x 4 [months on parental leave]) x 1 [working time factor as per
contract]}).
The maximum number of declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period is calculated as
follows: {((215/12) x 14 [months]) x 1} minus 71,67 day-equivalents of parental leave = 179,16,
rounded to 179 maximum declarable day-equivalents for the reporting period.
55EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
You will use this number (179) to calculate the daily rate, i.e. (actual personnel costs during the
reporting period) divided by 179.
Multiple parallel or consecutive contracts — If a person is employed with more than one
employment contract with the beneficiary during the reporting period (where allowed by
applicable law), the beneficiary should calculate a single daily rate. The actual personnel
costs are the sum of the costs of all these employment contracts during the months within
the reporting period. The maximum declarable day-equivalents are the sum of the maximum
declarable day-equivalents calculated individually for each of these employment contracts
during the months within the reporting period.
Contracts without fixed salary/hours — The maximum number of declarable day-
equivalents for employees that do not have a fixed amount of salary and working hours
defined in their contract but only an hourly rate (where allowed by applicable law and not
fitting under other cost categories, e.g. SME owners, subcontracting) can be calculated as
follows:
{((total salary paid to the employee in the reporting period) divided by (hourly rate fixed in the
employment contract)) divided by 8 [default day conversion factor]}
Example: A person does not have a fixed amount of working time and salary set out in the
contract but the contract specifies that the persons earns EUR 10/hour when called to perform a
certain task. Under the contract, you paid the persons EUR 7000 during the reporting period. The
maximum declarable day-equivalents are = EUR 7000 / 10 [hourly rate] / 8 = 87,5 for the
reporting period.
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — Such staff can NOT be charged under this
budget category because contracts with temporary work agencies qualify typically as
purchase of services (unless the temporary work agency carries out directly some task of the
action — in which case it would be considered as subcontracting). Although not eligible as
personnel costs, the costs can be charged under other budget categories (i.e. B.
Subcontracting or C.3 Other goods, works and services), if they comply with the eligibility
conditions (e.g. best value for money and no conflict of interest; see Articles 6.2.B and
6.2.C).
Project-based remuneration (option in HE) — If this option is activated in the Grant
Agreement, the beneficiaries may use this specific calculation method for the daily rate.
Note that for Horizon Europe, there are all in all three different ways how to calculate
the daily rate:
Case 1A: employee whose remuneration is fixed, i.e. same remuneration, regardless
whether they are involved in specific projects or not (actual costs; standard case, see 2.1.4
above)
Case 1B: employees whose remuneration increases through supplementary payments
depending on whether they work in specific projects (actual costs; specific case ‘project-
based remuneration’, this section)
Case 2: beneficiaries declaring personnel costs as unit costs in accordance with their usual
cost accounting practices (unit costs; specific case ‘average personnel costs’, see next
specific case below).
Project-based remuneration (Case 1B) should be used for employees (or equivalent) whose
level of remuneration (daily rate, hourly rate) increases when and because the employee
works in (EU, national or other) projects.
Example: An employee who gets a bonus or a new contract with a higher salary level for working
in a project.
56EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Employees whose salary does not increase when working in projects are covered by
Case 1A (not Case 1B); even when:
− the employment contract was signed explicitly to work in the action or
− the contract covering the work in the action is additional to the main contract with
the employee but has the same remuneration level as the main contract (i.e. same
hourly/daily rate) or
− part of the work in the action was done during overtime and the overtime hours are
paid at a higher rate resulting from national law, collective agreement or
employment contract, provided that such higher rate does not depend on projects.
For project-based remuneration (Case 1B), the daily rate must be calculated as follows:
Step 1 — Calculate the Case 1B action daily rate per person:
{actual personnel costs for work on the action [incl. project-based supplementary
payments, bonuses, increased salary, etc] during the months within the reporting
period}
divided by
{day-equivalents worked by the person on the action during the months within the
reporting period}
For the calculation of the action daily rate you may include the same elements in the
personnel costs as in Case 1A for the daily rate PLUS all bonuses you paid which were
triggered by the participation in the action (even if those bonuses were not based on
objective conditions). Bonuses triggered by the participation of the employee in other
projects must be excluded.
Step 2 — Compare the action daily rate with the national project daily rate, i.e. the
(theoretical) daily rate that you would pay to the person for work in national projects,
in accordance with your usual remuneration practices. The daily rate to be used for
the EU grant financial statement will be the lower of the two. In other words, if the
action daily rate is higher than the national project daily rate, then you will have to
use the national rate for that reporting period.
‘National projects’ are to be understood in the large sense, meaning all types of
projects funded under any type of national (public or private) funding scheme,
including projects co-financed by EU funds that are managed by EU Member States
(e.g. Regional Funds, Agricultural and Fisheries Funds). This must exclude EU grants
as defined in the Grant Agreement, i.e. actions funded by the EU Commission, EU
executive agencies or other funding bodies, which do not qualify as national projects.
The (theoretical) national project daily rate must be calculated the as follows:
{theoretical personnel costs for similar work in a national project over the same number
of months as the reporting period}
divided by
{maximum declarable day-equivalents}
The remuneration to which the person would be entitled to for work in national
projects must be defined:
− either in regulatory requirements (such as national law or collective labour
agreements)
− or in your written internal remuneration rules.
57EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the regulatory requirements or your written internal remuneration rules:
− provide for a bonus range (e.g. between 500 and 1000; between 10% and
50%) or a maximum ceiling (e.g. up to 50) rather than a precise amount per
day or per hour, the remuneration to which the person would be entitled to
(national project daily rate) is the average of the remuneration that the person
received for work in national projects in the complete year before the end of
the reporting period (e.g. calendar, financial or fiscal year depending on the
beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices) for which data is available (see
further below).
Example: If the beneficiary has calculated the action daily rate for a 18 month-
reporting period from 01/09/2021 to 28/02/2023, the average of the remuneration that
the person received for work in national projects could be calculated based on the data
of the complete calendar year 2022 (if available, otherwise of 2021 or the latest
available calendar, financial or fiscal year before 2021).
− provide for different levels of remuneration depending on the staff category,
the remuneration to which the person would be entitled to is the one of the
category to which the person belongs
− provide for different levels of remuneration depending on the type of
nationally-funded projects (and/or the type of work within these projects), the
remuneration to which the person would be entitled to is the one applicable to
the type of project (and/or work) that is closest to the action
− change over the reporting period, the remuneration to which the person would
be entitled to is the one that was applicable for the larger part of that reporting
period.
If there are no regulatory requirements and you do not have internal rules defining
objective conditions on which the national project daily rate can be determined, but
you can demonstrate that your usual practice is to pay bonuses for work in national
projects, the national project daily rate is the average of the remuneration that the
person received in the last complete year (calendar, financial or fiscal year, see
above) before the end of the reporting period for work in national projects calculated
as follows:
{(total personnel costs of the person in the last complete year) minus (remuneration paid
for EU actions during that complete year)}
divided by
{215 minus (days worked in EU actions during that complete year)}
‘EU actions’ are EU grants as defined in the Grant Agreement (i.e. awarded by EU
institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, including EU executive agencies, EU
regulatory agencies, EDA, joint undertakings).
‘Total personnel costs’ covers all types of contracts with the person that qualify
as personnel costs under Article 6.2.A.
If during the last reference period the person worked for the beneficiary only in EU
grants as defined in the Grant Agreement, you must calculate the national project
daily rate using the year before (or the last year in which the person worked in a
national project).
If the person is a new employee hired in the reporting period, their national project
daily rate, calculated according to the formula above, is the one applicable to the
employee whose base salary (salary without bonuses) is the most similar to that
person’s.
58EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Average personnel costs (option in HE, DEP, CEF, EDF, UCPM, HUMA,) — If this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement , beneficiaries who consistently calculate average rates for
their staff as part of their analytical cost accounting system, can use these average rates for
the daily rate.
You can use this method, provided that:
− the daily rate is calculated using the actual personnel costs recorded in your accounts,
excluding any ineligible cost or costs already included in other budget categories (no
double funding of the same costs)
Therefore, you may have to adjust your usual methodology in order to remove:
− costs that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement
Example: The daily rate in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices contains taxes not linked to the remuneration. Those taxes are ineligible and
must be removed when calculating the daily rates for the action.
− costs that are already included in other budget categories
Example: Beneficiaries whose cost accounting practices for personnel costs include
indirect costs. Indirect costs must be removed from the pool of costs used to calculate
the daily rate charged to the action because indirect costs must be declared using a flat
rate. Personnel costs cannot include any indirect costs.
If your usual methodology includes budgeted or estimated elements, we can only
accept those, if they:
− are relevant (i.e. clearly related to personnel costs)
− are used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not play a major role in the calculation)
− correspond to objective and verifiable information (i.e. their basis is clearly
defined and you can show how they were calculated)
Example: Calculating average 2021 daily rates by using 2020 payroll data and
increasing them by adding the CPI (consumer price index) on which the basic salaries
are indexed.
− you apply your cost accounting practices in a consistent manner, based on objective
criteria that must be verifiable if there is a check, review, audit or investigation. You
must do this no matter who is funding the action.
This does not mean that cost accounting practices must be the same for all your
employees, departments or cost centres. If, for example, your usual cost accounting
practices include different calculation methods for permanent personnel and
temporary personnel, this is acceptable. However, you cannot use different methods
for specific actions, projects or persons on an ad-hoc basis.
Example (acceptable): Individual (actual) personnel costs are used for researchers, average
personnel costs (unit costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices) are used for technical support staff.
Example (unacceptable): Average personnel costs are used to calculate costs in externally-
funded projects only.
If your usual cost accounting practice is to calculate hourly rates instead of daily rates, you
must convert the hourly rate into a daily rate as follows:
Daily rate = hourly rate x 8
Alternative: If you have a usual cost accounting practice determining the standard number of
annual productive hours of a full-time employee, you can alternatively multiply by the
number of hours resulting from the following formula (instead of by 8):
59EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
{The higher of: (the standard number of annual productive hours of a full-time employee
according to your practice) OR (90 % of the standard annual workable hours of a full-time
employee)}
divided by
215

General > Article 6.2.A.2, A3 Natural persons with direct contract and seconded persons
A.2 Natural persons with direct contract and seconded persons (all programmes except
SMP ESS, CUST/FISC)
A.2 and A.3 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract other than an employment
contract and costs for seconded persons by a third party against payment are also eligible as personnel
costs, if they are assigned to the action, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and:
(a) work under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way the work is
organised, the tasks that are performed and the premises where they are performed) and
(b) the result of the work belongs to the beneficiary (unless agreed otherwise).
They must be calculated on the basis of a rate which corresponds to the costs actually incurred for the direct
contract or secondment and must not be significantly different from those for personnel performing similar
tasks under an employment contract with the beneficiary.
1. Natural persons with direct contract (A.2) and seconded persons (A.3): Types of
costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS,
CUST/FISC), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Costs for natural persons under
direct contract’ or ‘Costs for seconded persons’.
These budget categories cover the costs of two types of persons:
− self-employed natural persons (e.g. some types of in-house consultants) who work on
the action for the beneficiary under conditions similar to those of an employee, but
under a contract that is legally not an employment contract
− persons who are seconded by a third party against payment.
‘Seconded’ means the temporary transfer of an employee from a third party (the employer)
to the beneficiary. Seconded persons are still paid and employed by the third party, but work
for the beneficiary. They are at the disposal of the beneficiary and work under its control and
instructions. A secondment normally requires the seconded person to work at the
beneficiary’s premises, although in specific cases it may be agreed otherwise in the
secondment agreement.
Best practice: The secondment agreement should detail the conditions of secondment (tasks,
reimbursement from one entity to the other, duration of the secondment, location, etc).
What not? Cost of persons who are employees of the beneficiary, (co)owners of the
beneficiary (if the beneficiary is an SME) or staff provided by a temporary work agency.
1.2 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract and persons seconded against
payment must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs of natural persons with direct contract (A.2) and seconded persons (A.3) must
comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.2 and 6.2.A.3, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration by the beneficiary, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− the person must be hired under either:
− a direct contract signed between you and the natural person (not through
another legal entity; e.g. a temporary work agency) or
61EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− a contract signed between you and a legal entity fully owned by that natural
person, and which has no other staff than the natural person being hired or
− a secondment agreement with the employer of the natural person
− the person must work under conditions similar to those of an employee, in particular:
− the beneficiary must organise and supervise the work of the person in a way
similar to that of its employees
Example (acceptable): The beneficiary's project leader and the person discuss
regularly the work to be carried out for the action. The project leader decides the tasks
and timing of the work and instructs the person accordingly.
Example (not acceptable): The beneficiary's project leader and the person meet only
once a month or irregularly, for updates on the state of play of the entrusted work. If
changes are needed, they have to be agreed by the person and may lead to a change of
the amount charged to the beneficiary.
− the person is subject to similar presence requirements as the employees
Examples (acceptable):
1. The person works physically at the beneficiary's premises, following a time schedule
similar to that of the employees (e.g. the beneficiary authorises up to two days of
teleworking per week to its personnel and the person has chosen to benefit from this
regime, i.e. works 2 days in teleworking and 3 days physically at the beneficiary's
premises).
2. The beneficiary does not require any presence at its premises and allows all its
employees to telework full-time from anywhere in the world. The person choses to
telework from home, i.e. the country where the seconding organisation is established.
Examples (not acceptable):
1. The beneficiary applies a consistent policy of only authorising up to two days of
teleworking per week. However, the person works four days per week in teleworking
and only one day at the beneficiary's premises.
2. The beneficiary applies a consistent policy of requiring all staff to work at its
premises. However, the person works from a country other than the one where the
beneficiary is located.
− the remuneration must be based on working time, rather than on delivering
specific outputs/products.
Similar conditions does not mean equal conditions. The working conditions of the
person do NOT have to be exactly the same that those of an employee, but overall
similar.
− the result of the work carried out (including patents or copyright) must in principle
belong to the beneficiary; if (exceptionally) it belongs to the person, the beneficiary
must (just like for employees) obtain the necessary rights from the person (transfer,
licences or other), in order to be able to respect its obligations under the Grant
Agreement
− the cost of the person must not be significantly different from costs for employees of
the beneficiary performing similar tasks; if the beneficiary does not have employees
performing similar tasks, the comparison must be done with national salary references
of the country where the beneficiary is located, for the staff category to which the
person belongs in the sector of activity of the beneficiary and
− the cost must correspond exclusively to the remuneration of the person and related
eligible taxes.
62EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the costs do not fulfil all the conditions indicated here above, they may be eligible as
purchase of services (see Article 6.2.C.3) or subcontracting (see Article 6.2.B) but NOT as
personnel costs.
Thus, for seconded persons, if the resulting daily rate is higher than the daily rate actually
paid by the third party to the seconded person (applying the calculation rules of the Grant
Agreement) the costs can NOT be declared as personnel costs. They may be eligible instead as
purchase of services (see Article 6.2.C.3) or subcontracting (see Article 6.2.B). The reason is that
in this case the payment made by the beneficiary to the third party would be higher than the
actual remuneration of the person, and this implies that there is a commercial margin (or
other non-personnel cost) that is being charged by the third party to the beneficiary.
1.4 Costs of natural persons working under a direct contract and seconded persons against
payment must be calculated as follows:
{amount per unit [daily rate]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate must be calculated as follows:
− if the contract specifies a daily rate: this daily rate must be used; if the contract fixes
an hourly rate instead of a daily rate, you must convert the hourly rate into a daily
rate (daily rate = hourly rate x 8)
− if the contract states a fixed amount for the work and the number of days to be
worked (or hours; in that case 8 hours = 1 day-equivalent): the global amount for the
work must be divided by the number day-equivalents to be worked
− if the contract states a fixed amount for the work, but does not specify the number of
days (or hours) that must be worked: the global amount for the work must be divided
by the pro-rata of 215 annual day-equivalents which corresponds to the duration of
the contract over the reporting period
Example: The contract provides that the person will work at the beneficiary's premises for
assisting in action tasks. The contract is for 6 months starting on 01/01/2021 and ending on
30/06/2021. According to its time records, the person worked 60 day-equivalents in the action
over that period. The contract sets a monthly payment of EUR 3 000 but does not explicitly
establish the number of days/hours to be worked.
Personnel costs for the action = 60 (day-equivalents worked in the action) x daily rate
Daily rate = annual personnel costs / pro-rata of 215 = (3 000 € x 6 months) / (215 x (6
months/12 months)) = 18 000 € / (215 x 0,5) = 18 000 € / 107,5 days = 167,44 €/day
Personnel costs for the action = 60 x 167,44 = 10 046,4€.
Cost elements that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (even if they are part of the
amount stated in the contract) must be removed from the calculation of the personnel cost.
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — If a pro-rata number of 215 annual day-equivalents is used
in the calculation of the amount per unit (daily rate), you must respect the horizontal ceiling (see
Article 6.2.A.1).
Maximum declarable day-equivalents — If a number of day-equivalents (specified directly
in the contract or determined via a pro-rata of 215 day-equivalents) is used in the calculation of
the amount per unit (daily rate), you can NOT declare more day-equivalents worked on the action
than the number of day-equivalents used to calculate the daily rate.
63EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Specific cases (costs for natural persons with direct contract and seconded
personnel (A.2, A.3)):
Persons seconded against payment from a third party located in a different country
than the beneficiary — As salary levels are not homogeneous across different countries,
the remuneration of the person paid by the third party, and so the actual costs paid for the
secondment, might be higher than those paid by the beneficiary for employees performing
similar tasks. In that case, the actual costs paid for the secondment can still be considered
eligible, if the beneficiary can demonstrate that its usual practice is to pay for secondments at
the level of the actual remuneration of the seconded person.
Secondment of staff between beneficiaries/affiliated entities — Is allowed, but it is
the beneficiary/affiliated entity who employs the person who has to declare its costs (NOT the
beneficiary/affiliated to whom the person has been seconded).
Fellowships, scholarships, stipends, internship or similar agreements (not
employees) — Costs for persons (e.g. students, PhDs and other researchers) under
fellowships, scholarships, stipends, internship or similar agreements, through which they
work for the beneficiary on the action (without having an employment contract) can be
accepted, if the agreement is work-oriented (as opposed to training-oriented: i.e. not aimed
at helping the student to acquire professional skills).
Such cost can be charged to the action as personnel costs, if they fulfil the conditions set out
in Article 6.1 and 6.2.A.2, and in particular:
− the assignment of tasks and the remuneration complies with the applicable national
law (e.g. on taxes, labour and social security)
− the recipients of fellowships, scholarships and stipends have the necessary
qualifications to carry out the tasks allocated to them under the action.
PhD agreements are considered work-oriented. However, time for training, if any, may NOT
be charged to the action.
Fellowships, scholarships and stipends, etc. that are not work-oriented are cannot be charged
as personnel costs, but may be eligible as financial support to third parties (FSTP; cost
category D.1), if explicitly allowed by the call conditions and in line with Annex 1 (see Article
6.2.D.1).
Cost for exemptions from academic fees (HE) — The fees (or the fee exemption) are
eligible as personnel cost, if the student contract includes the amount of waived fees as part
of their remuneration. The other conditions set out in Article 6 have to be fulfilled as well
(e.g. the full remuneration, included the value of the waived fees, must be recorded in the
university’s accounts).

General > Article 6.2.A.4 SME owners and natural person beneficiaries
A.4 SME owners and natural person beneficiaries (all programmes except SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI)
[additional OPTION for programmes with SME owner unit cost: A.4 The work of SME owners for the
action (i.e. owners of beneficiaries that are small and medium-sized enterprises20 not receiving a salary) or
natural person beneficiaries (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary) may be
declared as personnel costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.]
20 For the definition, see Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC: micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) are enterprises
- engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of their legal form (including, in particular, self- employed persons and family
businesses engaged in craft or other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity) and
- employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Recommendation) and
which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43
million.
1. SME owners and natural person beneficiaries (A.4): Types of costs — Forms —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except SMP ESS, EUAF,
CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘SME owner/natural
person beneficiary costs’.
This budget category covers the costs of two types of persons:
− Persons who are directly owners or co-owners (regardless of their percentage of
ownership) of the beneficiary, if the beneficiary is an SME and the person is not an
employee of the beneficiary. It applies also to SME owners whose work in the action
for the beneficiary is remunerated via any type of non-employment contract (e.g. a
service contract), via profit distribution or by any remuneration method other than a
salary resulting from an employment contract.
− Beneficiaries who are natural persons; i.e. who signed the Grant Agreement on
her/his own name as individuals, not on behalf of another legal person (e.g. a
company).
‘Directly’ means not owners (or co-owners) through another company owned by them.
What not? SME owners who receive a salary (registered as such in the accounts of the SME)
cannot declare personnel costs under this budget category, unless they can show that this
salary corresponds exclusively to the management of the SME (and is therefore not linked to
the action).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit cost, using the unit cost (daily rate) fixed by the
authorising decision C(2020)71156 and set out in Annex 2a.
6 Commission Decision of 20 October 2020 authorising the use of unit costs for the personnel costs of the owners
of small and medium-sized enterprises and beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary for the
work carried out by themselves under an action or work programme (C(2020)7715).
65EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The amount per unit (daily rate) is prefixed in the authorising decision, adjusted depending
on the country where the beneficiary/affiliated entity is established:
Amount per unit [daily rate] = {EUR 5 080 /18 days [i.e. 282,22]}
multiplied by
{country-specific correction coefficient of the country where the
beneficiary is established}
The country-specific correction coefficient is the one for HE MSCA actions (see Horizon Europe
Work Programme > Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions in force at the time of the call).
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.4, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be declared for an SME owner/natural person beneficiary, who works on the action but
does not receive a salary.
The granting authority may verify that the beneficiary fulfils the conditions for using this unit
cost.
1.4 The costs must be calculated, for the SME owner/natural person, in accordance with the
methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the SME owner/natural person personnel costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed in the authorising decision (see above).
The calculation itself is automated by the IT system. The beneficiary/affiliated entity must
only indicate the number of days worked on the action and the system will then correctly
calculate the personnel costs (based on the parameters described above).
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — For SME owner/natural person beneficiaries unit costs, the
horizontal ceiling (see Article 6.2.A.1) applies not only in case of work on multiple actions, but also
where the person worked in only one EU grant during a given calendar year.

[additional OPTION for programmes with volunteers costs: A.5 The work of volunteers for the action (i.e.
persons who freely work for an organisation, on a non-compulsory basis and without being paid) may be
declared as personnel costs, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.
They:
- may not exceed the maximum amount for volunteers for the action (which corresponds to 50% of the
total (ineligible and eligible) project costs and contributions estimated in the proposal)
- may not exceed the maximum amount for volunteers for each beneficiary set out in Annex 2
- may not make the maximum EU contribution to costs higher than the total eligible costs without
volunteers.
If also indirect costs for volunteers are declared eligible in the call conditions, the amount of indirect costs
may be added to the volunteers costs category in Annex 2, at the flat-rate set out in Point E.]
1. Volunteers (A.5): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (ERDF-TA, LIFE, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV,
JUST, ESF/SOCPL, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM, RELEX), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Volunteers costs’.
This budget category allows to increase the grant amount in order to recognise the
contribution of volunteers in the project, i.e. when persons work for the beneficiary, on a
non-compulsory basis and without being paid.
What not? The unit costs for volunteers work do not cover any actual costs which might be
incurred and paid by the beneficiary, such as insurance, social security, travel or subsistence
costs. Any such costs can be declared and reimbursed separately (if provided for in the call
conditions).
1.2. The work carried out by volunteers can be declared as unit cost, using the unit cost
fixed by the authorising decision C(2019)26467 and set out in Annex 2a.
The amount per unit (daily rate) is prefixed in the authorising decision, depending on the
country where the volunteering activity takes place:

1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.5, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)).
In addition, a double cap must be applied to limit the amounts declared for volunteers' work
or the amount of the total EU contribution:
− the total EU contribution must be less than the total eligible costs excluding volunteer
work.
− the amounts declared for volunteers work must also not exceed the maximum amount
for volunteers for each beneficiary set out in Annex 2.
1.4. The costs must be calculated, for the volunteer working on the action, in accordance
with the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the volunteer personnel costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate depending on country]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed in the authorising decision (see above).
If a use per hour is necessary, you must convert the daily rate as follows: hourly rate = daily
rate / 8).
68EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If explicitly allowed by the call conditions, you can also add indirect costs to the volunteers
costs.
This calculation is however not automated in the system (i.e. the automatically calculated
indirect costs in cost category E will not include this extra amount). If you want to charge the
indirect costs, you must add them manually to the costs in cost category A.5 Volunteers
costs, on top of the direct volunteers costs (i.e. calculate the indirect volunteers costs:
{indirect cost flat rate x direct volunteers costs} and add this amount to the volunteers costs
in cost category A.5).

1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Other personnel costs’.
Such cost categories exist currently only in a limited number of EU programmes (HE, SMP
ESS, CUST/FISC):
− HE personnel unit cost (see Article 6.2.A.6 HE_Personnel unit costs)
− SMP ESS personnel costs based on time (see Article 6.2.A.6 SMP_ESS_Personnel unit

[additional OPTION for HE: A.6 For beneficiaries with personnel unit cost, the personnel costs under
categories A.1-A.4 must be declared as unit cost and are eligible, if they fulfil the general eligibility
conditions, are calculated as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a and comply with
the conditions set out in Points A.1-A.4 for the underlying types of costs (personnel).]
1. HE Personnel unit cost (A.6): Types of costs — Forms — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for all Horizon Europe types of action which are
mixed actual cost grants (e.g. RIA, CSA, PCP/PPI, COFUND, ERC, EIC, EIT).
This cost category is optional in the sense that it is granted only on request. However,
once the unit cost is approved, it must be used in all HE actions (i.e. new proposals
submitted after the approval date and not yet signed grants under preparation; and
including to calculate personnel costs for lump sum grants in the proposal’s detailed
budget table).
The approved unit cost is valid for at least two years. You may request an update to
the unit cost amount, every two years after the approval date, until 31 December 2027.
The updated unit cost will apply to all the beneficiary’s Horizon Europe and Euratom
proposals that are invited to grant preparation after the new approval date.
You may change your mind ONCE. After the approval you may, if needed, request to
revert back to actual personnel costs (i.e. charging costs under categories A1 to A4), for
all future grants signed after the unit cost is withdrawn (ongoing grants would not be
impacted). Please be aware that if you revert back to actual costs, you will not be able to
request again the use of the personnel unit cost for the rest of the MFF period 2021-2027.
For beneficiaries/affiliated entities that have selected this unit cost, they must (once
approved) charge all their personnel costs under ‘HE Personnel unit cost’.
This budget category replaces categories A1-A4 (A.1 Employees, A.2 Natural persons with
direct contract, A.3 Seconded persons against payment, or A.4 SME owners and natural
person beneficiaries) and covers the cost of all personnel that works on HE actions.
What not? Cost category A.6 can NOT be used to declare costs for personnel with other
kinds of working relationships (e.g. staff provided by a temporary work agency must still be
declared either as purchase of services or subcontracting).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs, using the unit cost (daily rate) approved by
the granting authority in accordance with the HE personnel unit cost authorising decision8 and
set out in Annex 2a.
8 Decision of 15 January 2024 authorising the use of unit costs for personnel costs for actions under the Horizon
Europe and Euratom Programmes.
71EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The precise unit cost (daily rate, i.e. EUR/day) is not prefixed by the authorising decision. It
must be calculated and approved for each beneficiary/affiliated entity organisation in the
Portal Participant Register.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (daily rate) is:
Amount per unit [daily rate] = {total staff costs of the beneficiary in the last closed full financial
year9}
divided by
{annual work units in the last closed full financial year²}
divided by
{215 days}
The result is subject to a maximum cap per country.
{EUR 9 618 multiplied by the corresponding country-specific correction coefficient
divided by
18 days}
The country-specific correction coefficient is the one for HE MSCA actions (see Horizon Europe
Work Programme > Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions in force at the time of the approval).
You can make a test calculation by using the wizard available on the Portal.
In order to formally request the use of the personnel unit cost, the request must be
submitted by the organisation’s legal entity authorised representative (LEAR) through the
Portal (by entering total staff costs in the last closed full financial year, number of annual
work units and country of establishment). It must be supported by an audit certificate
(template to be used) provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent
and complies with Directive 2006/43/EC (or for public bodies: by a competent independent
public officer. The amount approved will be accessible in the Portal Participant Register.
The granting authority may verify that the provided data in the audit certificate match those
in the statutory annual accounts and/or other official documents on which the audit certificate
was delivered (and correct it, if needed).
For more information concerning the unit cost validation procedure, see HE Personnel unit cost
validation procedure.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.6, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b))
− be calculated in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a
− be declared based on the number of day-equivalents for persons working on the action
and
9 At the moment of the request for the unit cost (or the request for its update).
72EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− comply with the specific conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.1-A.4 for the underlying
types of costs. This means that costs can be declared in category A.6 only for
personnel who have a working relationship with the beneficiary/affiliated entity falling
under the categories A.1 Employees, A.2 Natural persons with direct contract, A.3
Seconded persons against payment, or A.4 SME owners and natural person
beneficiaries. Since in HE in-kind contributions are eligible, cost category A.6 may also
be used for seconded persons free-of-charge who have such a working relationship
with a third party (e.g. an employee of a third party seconded free-of-charge to the
beneficiary).
1.4 The costs must be calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the
authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the HE personnel unit costs is:
{amount per unit [daily rate approved in the Portal Participant Register]}
multiplied by
{number of day-equivalents worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed by the granting authority in the Participant Register, based on the rate
requested by the beneficiary/affiliated entity (see above).
The calculation itself is automated by the IT system. The beneficiary/affiliated entity must
only indicate the number of days worked on the action and the system will then correctly
calculate the personnel costs (based on the parameters described above)
Horizontal 215-days ceiling — For HE Personnel unit costs, the horizontal ceiling (see Article
6.2.A.1) applies not only in case of work on multiple actions, but also where the person worked in
only one EU grant during a given calendar year.

− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be declared for a person working on the action, based on time.
1.4 The costs must be calculated, for each person, in accordance with the methodology set
out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the ESS personnel costs based on time is:
{amount per unit [daily rate depending on salary grid fixed in Annex 2b]}
multiplied by
{number of days worked on the action}
The daily rate is fixed by the granting authority, based on the salary grids of the
beneficiary/affiliated entity in Annex 2b (see above).

2.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for all SMP ESS actions.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge their personnel costs under
‘ESS personnel costs based on deliverables’.
This budget category replaces categories A.1-A.5 and covers the cost of personnel that works
on SMP ESS actions based on deliverables (e.g. persons paid per survey).

A.6 Customs/Fiscalis personnel costs
A.6 Customs/Fiscalis personnel costs are eligible, if (and in as far as) declared eligible in the call conditions
and if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit cost in accordance with the
method set out in Annex 2a and the following:
{daily rate
multiplied by
number of actual days worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The number of actual days declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 20).
The daily rate is the rate of the pay grade set out in Annex 2a (or — for personnel without an applicable pay
grade — the rate of the grade with the closest basic salary).

1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for all CUST/FISC actions.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge their personnel costs under
‘Customs/Fiscalis personnel costs’.
This budget category replaces categories A.1-A.5 and covers the cost of all personnel that
works on CUST/FISC actions.
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs, using the individual unit cost salary grid (daily
rates) agreed with the granting authority (see CUST/FISC authorising decision11 and Annex
2a and 2b).
The precise unit cost (daily rates, i.e. EUR/day) is not prefixed by the authorising decision. It
must be calculated for each grant and then entered into the unit cost table in Annex 2b of the
Grant Agreement.
For more information concerning the salary grid validation, see CUST/FISC Unit cost grid
validation procedure.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.A.6, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the

[OPTION 2 for programmes with subcontracting (standard):
Subcontracting costs for the action (including related duties, taxes and charges[OPTION for programmes
with VAT eligible:, such as non-deductible or non-refundable value added tax (VAT))]) are eligible, if they
are calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are
awarded using the beneficiary’s usual purchasing practices — provided these ensure subcontracts with best
value for money (or if appropriate the lowest price) and that there is no conflict of interests (see Article 12).
Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU Directives on public
procurement must also comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.
[additional OPTION for programmes with additional subcontracting rules: [OPTION if selected for the
call21: In addition, if the value of the subcontracts to be awarded exceeds EUR […], the beneficiaries must
comply with the following rules: […].]]
[additional OPTION for programmes with country restrictions for subcontracting costs: [OPTION if
selected for the call: The beneficiaries must ensure that the subcontracted work is performed in the eligible
countries or target countries set out in the call conditions — unless otherwise approved by the granting
authority.]]
[[OPTION if selected for the grant22: Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the action.]]
The tasks to be subcontracted and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1 and the
total estimated costs of subcontracting per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2 (or may be approved ex
post in the periodic report, if the use of subcontracting does not entail changes to the Agreement which would
call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants;
‘simplified approval procedure’).]
21 If the RAO decides to set specific rules, they must be set out in the call and take into account the value of the contracts and the relative
size of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk (proportionality). Specific rules may only be set for the
award of contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000.
22 This is a standard obligation for all EU grants. It may be unselected only for actions where subcontracting is a key/large part of the action
(e.g infrastructure projects; PCP/PPI; technical assistance, statistical programmes, etc).
1. Subcontracting costs (B.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes), beneficiaries/affiliated
entities may charge ‘Subcontracting costs’.
This budget category covers subcontracted action tasks, i.e. contracts for parts of the project
described in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1) that are not implemented by the
beneficiary itself, but by a subcontractor.
78EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Subcontracts are normally wide in scope (implementation of a part of the project, i.e.
action tasks). If a contract covers only individual equipment or consumables that do not
constitute an action task by itself, this will be considered as a purchase (see Article 6.2.C.2
and C.3).
Only limited parts of the action may be subcontracted — unless explicitly allowed in
the call conditions/Grant Agreement. Limited parts means that subcontracting remains
proportionate both in terms of share and type of subcontracted action tasks, as well as in
terms of share in the eligible cost. The acceptable limit is assessed by the granting
authority based on the nature of the action, which may vary between programmes and
calls. For some programmes with large infrastructure projects (e.g. CEF), it is
systematically disactivated.
1.2 Subcontracting costs must be declared as actual costs.
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.B, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− be based either on the best value for money (considering the quality of the service,
good or work proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest price
− not be subject to conflict of interest and
− for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ within the
meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24, 2014/25 and
2009/81)12: comply with the applicable national law on public procurement; these
rules normally provide for special procurement procedures for the types of contracts
they cover.
The beneficiaries can in principle freely choose between best value for money and lowest
price.
Best value for money applies the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial
management) to the subcontracting context.
A competitive selection of subcontractors should be the default approach since it is the safest
way to ensure no conflict of interest, best value for money or lowest price through direct
comparisons between offers. However, subcontracting does not necessarily require
competitive selection procedures to be eligible, provided that, in case of a check, review,
audit or investigation, the beneficiary can prove compliance with best value for money or
lowest price AND no conflict of interest, for instance by showing:
− data from a previous competitive tender on a similar subject that confirms the market
value
− a conducted market consultation, e.g. price quotations, supplier brochures, or
consultation with help of independent experts

79EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− that no suitable offers have been submitted in response to a prior competitive
selection procedure
− that a subcontractor is in a monopoly situation due to technical reasons; or exclusive
(intellectual property) rights; or acquisition of a unique work of art or artistic
performance; or that the task can only be performed by an international organisation
which cannot participate in competitive procedures according to its statutes
− that the subcontractor is the winner of a prior competitive design contest under the
action or a linked action
− a need for special security measures in order to protect the essential interests of the
EU or Member States in accordance with the call conditions.
The beneficiary must be able to demonstrate that the criteria defining quality were clear and
coherent with the purpose.
Best practice: It is recommended to entrust the decision of awarding a contract to an
evaluation committee rather than to a sole person. Members of the evaluation committee
should be aware that they need to disclose the existence of a conflict of interest. The
beneficiary should have clear rules and guidance on situations of conflict of interest. These
rules should provide information on who to contact for advice or disclose the conflict to and,
where necessary, the appropriate action. It is good practice that staff involved in the
procurement process formally signs a declaration of no conflict of interests before performing
their duties.
Subcontracts (tasks to be subcontracted and estimated costs; not necessarily the
subcontractor, especially if not yet known) must be justified in Annex 1 (simplified approval
procedure allowed; see below).
1.4 Regarding the calculation, the amount charged as eligible cost must correspond to the
amount invoiced by the subcontractor.
Specific cases (subcontracting costs (B.)):
Simplified approval procedure (new subcontracts) — If the need for a subcontract was
not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to
introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report (simplified approval
procedure). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting
authority might not approve the new subcontract and reject the costs at interim or final
payment-stage later on.
Subcontracting in actions affecting security or public order (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF) —
If provided for in the call conditions, the simplified approval procedure is NOT allowed and
specific participation conditions and cost eligibility criteria may apply to subcontracting in
actions that concern essential interest of the EU and its Member States.
Subcontracting of action tasks involving classified information — Action tasks
involving EU classified information may ONLY be subcontracted (cumulative conditions):
− to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission) and
− if the granting authority has explicitly approved such requests in writing (see Article
13.2 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
80EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Coordination tasks of the coordinator (e.g. distribution of funds, review of reports and
other tasks listed in Article 7) — Can NOT be subcontracted (they can only be delegated,
under certain circumstances, to an entity with ‘authorisation to administer’ or in the case of
‘sole beneficiaries’ within the meaning of Article 190(2) of the Financial Regulation
2024/250913; see Article 7).
Subcontracting to beneficiaries — Is NOT allowed in the same grant. All beneficiaries
contribute to and are interested in the action; if one beneficiary needs the services of another
in order to perform its part of the work it is the second beneficiary who should declare its
own costs for that work.
Subcontracting to affiliates — Is normally NOT allowed in the same grant. As for
subcontracting between beneficiaries (see above), affiliated entities participating in the action
should declare instead their own cost for that work. Subcontracting to affiliated entities not
participating in the action is possible only exceptionally e.g. in case of monopoly or where
they have a framework contract (affiliate is their usual provider). The subcontracting still
needs to comply with the general and specific cost eligibility conditions, in particular ensure
best value for money or lowest price and avoid any conflict of interest. As best practice, these
affiliates should rather be added to the action, be identified as affiliated entities under Article
8 and declare their own costs for that work.
Subcontracting to associated partners or third parties giving in-kind contributions
— Exceptionally possible, e.g. in case of monopoly or where they have a framework contract
(the associated partner or third party giving in-kind contributions is their usual provider) and
provided that the Annex 1 DoA explains clearly what tasks the participant will perform as
associated partner, or contribute to as third party giving in-kind contributions and what tasks
will be performed as subcontractor (the latter remaining the responsibility of the
subcontracting beneficiary). The subcontracting needs to comply with the general and specific
eligibility conditions, in particular ensure best value for money or lowest price and avoid any
conflict of interest.
Framework contracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if this is
the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of service). In order to be eligible, the
framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money or
lowest price and absence of conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily
have to be concluded before the start of the action.

1. Purchase costs (C.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions —
Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may
charge ‘Purchase costs’.
This budget category covers, depending on the options that apply, the following sub-
categories:
− Travel, accommodation and subsistence (see Article 6.2.C.1)
− Equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2)
− Other goods, works or services, if necessary to implement the action (see Article
6.2.C.3).
Purchase contracts are normally limited in scope. If a contract covers the
implementation of action tasks, this will be considered as a case of subcontracting (see
Article 6.2.B).
1.2 Depending on the provisions in the Grant Agreement, purchase costs must be declared
as actual costs or unit cost (unit cost is provided for travel and subsistence costs for instance
in EMFAF, IMCAP, SMP, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV, JUST, ESF/SOCPL, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, TSI, UCPM).
1.3. The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred/units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a) and (b))
82EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− be based either on the best value for money (considering the quality of the service,
good or work proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest price
− not be subject to conflict of interest and
− for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ within the
meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24, 2014/25 and
2009/81)14: comply with the applicable national law on public procurement; these
rules normally provide for special procurement procedures for the types of contracts
they cover.
The beneficiaries can in principle freely choose between best value for money and lowest
price.
Best value for money applies the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial
management) to the purchasing context. It does NOT necessarily require competitive
selection procedures. However, if a beneficiary did not request several offers, it must — in
case of a check, review, audit or investigation — be able to show that the price was market-
value and that the criteria defining quality were clear and coherent with the purposes of the
purchase (for detailed guidance, see cost category 6.2.B above).
Selecting the lowest price may be appropriate for automatic award procedures where the
contract is awarded to the company that meets the conditions and quotes the lowest price
(e.g. electronic tendering for consumables).
1.4 The calculation method depends on the type of cost (depreciation, actual or unit cost;
see below).
Specific cases (purchase costs (C.)):
Purchases between participants — Are in principle not accepted. If a beneficiary needs
supplies from another beneficiary, it is the latter beneficiary that should charge them to the
action as cost. (Otherwise there is the risk that the grant is used to charge commercial profit
margins.) Purchases between participants will only be accepted in exceptional and properly
justified cases. For detailed explanations, see the specific cases in Article 6.2.B on
subcontracting between different types of participants.
Framework contracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if this is
the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of goods). In order to be eligible, the
framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money or
lowest price and absence of conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily
have to be concluded before the start of the action.
Providers of research infrastructures services for transnational and virtual access of
users (HE) — The reimbursement of their costs by the beneficiaries will be considered as a
specific purchase of services which will be specified in Annex 1. If (e.g. due to the applicable
national law) an entity providing research infrastructure services cannot issue an invoice to a
beneficiary, but is paid or reimbursed via any other form of transaction, this can be
assimilated to an invoice and accepted as eligible purchase costs.

83EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best value for money can be assured if the providers do not make a profit and their access
costs are calculated according to a well-defined methodology. To this extent, sufficient details
must be provided, such as name of the service providers, purchase costs and object, as well
as the explanation why these service providers are needed and why the purchase costs of the
services are appropriate.
Example: Beneficiaries can explain why these providers of scientific services are necessary for the
action, confirm that they will not include any profit margin when being reimbursed by the
beneficiaries; that they will bear part of the access costs to the research infrastructure (because
some of their costs will not be reimbursed like depreciation costs of their equipments).
Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the granting authority, if they intend to amend the
grant to change a specific purchase of service assessed during proposal evaluation or to
introduce a new specific purchase of service during the action implementation.

[OPTION 1 for programmes without travel and subsistence costs (ineligible):
Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with travel and subsistence costs:
Purchases for travel, accommodation and subsistence must be calculated as follows:
- travel: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line with the
beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]
- accommodation: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line
with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]
- subsistence: [OPTION A (actual costs): on the basis of the costs actually incurred and in line with
the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel] [OPTION B (unit or actual costs): as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a if covered by Decision C(2021)35 or otherwise as
costs actually incurred and in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel]. ]
1. Travel and subsistence costs (actual costs) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the actual cost option (HE, DEP, EDF,
CEF, LIFE, AGRIP, HUMA, RELEX), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Travel and
subsistence costs’ as actual costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘actual costs’ (NOT ‘unit or actual costs’;
see Data Sheet, Point 3).
This budget category covers travels and related accommodation and subsistence allowances
needed for the action. For some programmes, it is specifically broken down in the following
sub-categories:
− Travel
− Accommodation
− Subsistence.
1.2 If the actual costs option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the costs must be
declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.1, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a)) and
− be in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel.
85EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The travels for which costs are claimed must be necessary for the action (e.g. to present a
paper explaining the results at a conference). Travel costs related to an event at which the
beneficiary carried out work that was not specifically related to the action are NOT eligible.
All travel costs must be limited to the needs of the action; costs related to extensions (for
other professional or private reasons) are NOT eligible.
Moreover, they must be adequately recorded.
Costs for breakfast for an overnight stay (if not included in the cost of the hotel room) can be
charged (as subsistence costs) to the action if it is the beneficiary’s normal practice to
reimburse them.
Costs of a combined travel (i.e. where the end point of travel is different from the start) can
be charged to the action ONLY up to the cost that would have been incurred if the travel
would have been made exclusively for the action (i.e. up to the theoretical cost of travelling
directly back to the start point) AND if:
− it is the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay for such travels (e.g. travels combining
professional and personal reasons)
− it has been an actual cost for the beneficiary.
Record-keeping — In the case of combined travel, the beneficiary must keep records of
not only the actual cost of the subsequent travel leg(s), but also of the theoretical direct
return travel after the end of the work for the action in order to prove the cost that would
have been incurred.
If the beneficiary reimburses travel and/or subsistence allowances as a per diem payment, it
is the per diem amount that is considered an eligible cost, NOT the actual prices paid by the
person receiving the per diem. (For the purposes of the grant, these per diem costs remain
actual costs, NOT simplified forms such as unit costs). They must be recorded in the
beneficiary’s accounts and will be checked if there is an audit.
1.4 There is no specific calculation method; the costs must correspond to the eligible costs
actually incurred (amounts paid for the travel, accommodation and subsistence).
Best practice: Beneficiaries that have special/atypical/particularly expensive travel plans
should contact the granting authority for advice.
Record-keeping — In terms of record-keeping, the beneficiary must keep evidence of the
actual costs incurred as well as evidence that the instance of travel fulfils the general eligibility
conditions for actual costs (for example that the travel was linked to the action).
2. Travel and subsistence costs (unit costs) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
2.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the unit cost option (most
programmes, e.g. I3, ERDF-TA, IMREG, EMFAF, IMCAP, SMP, ERASMUS, CREA, CERV, JUST,
ESF/SOCPL, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, EUAF, CUST/FISC, PERI (partial), TSI, UCPM), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Travel and subsistence costs’ as unit costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘unit or actual costs’ (NOT ‘actual
costs’; see Data Sheet, Point 3).
86EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This budget category covers travels needed for the action, broken down in the following sub-
categories:
− Travel
− Accommodation
− Subsistence.
2.2 If the unit cost option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the costs must be declared
using the unit cost fixed by the authorising decision C(2021)3515 and set out in Annex 2a.
Which unit cost? Check the opening date of your call — the unit costs that you must use
for your grant will always depend on the date on which the call for proposals was opened.
Land travel’ means:
- for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: trips between 50 and 399 km by any
form of land-based travel (bus, rail or car) and trips above 400km by rail
- for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: trips between 50 and 399 km by any
form of land-based travel, and trips between 400 and 600 km by rail.
Travel below 50km will not be reimbursed using the travel unit costs. Such costs can be
reimbursed using actual costs, if it is the usual practice of the beneficiary to reimburse such
short-distance travel.
If a particular instance of travel, accommodation or subsistence in the action is not covered
by one of the unit costs mentioned in the authorising decision C(2021)35, actual costs may
be used (in same way as ‘Travel and subsistence as actual costs’ above).
In practice, this is usually the case for:
− travel between 50 and 399km in a non-EU country
− travel between 50 and 399km between a Member State and a non-EU country (except
for land-based travel between Member States and bordering countries for calls with
opening date as from 31 July 2024)
− land travel between 50 and 399km in LU, CY or MT
− ferry or boat travel from island to island or island to mainland
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: land travel above 400 km or above
600 km where specific unit costs for distances between 400 and 600 km are provided
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: journeys less than 400 km which
necessitate air travel because land travel is not possible or appropriate (see specific
case below).
The amounts per unit are prefixed by the authorising decision.
2.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.1, in
particular:
15 Commission Decision of 12 January 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for travel, accommodation and
subsistence costs under an action or work programme under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework
(C(2021)35) as amended by Commission Decision C(2023)4928 of 26.07.2023.
87EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc; see Article
6.1(b)) and
− be purchased for the action and in accordance with Article 6.2.C.
2.4 The costs must be calculated, for each travel and person travelling, in accordance with
the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
Regarding travel:
The formulas for calculating the travel are:
- for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024:
− by air above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x number of journeys}
− by rail above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x number of journeys}
− combined air and rail above 400 km: {amount depending on distance band x number of
journeys}
− land travel (50 – 399km) in 1 Member State: {amount for intra-Member State x number of
journeys}
− land travel (50-399km) between 2 Member States: {amount for inter-Member State travel
x number of journeys}
− travel between EU and one of EU’s outermost regions and overseas countries and territories
(OCTs)5: {specific unit cost for that OCT x number of journeys}
− journey of less than 400 km not covered by land transport (e.g. Helsinki/Tallinn): {unit
cost for air travel (400-600 km) x number of journeys}
− travel to/from places more than 400 km from a primary airport (e.g. certain regions in
Finland): {relevant unit cost for air travel x 150% number of journeys}
- for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024:
– by air or combined air and rail above 400km: {amount depending on distance band x
number of journeys}
– land travel in 1 Member State (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600k where relevant): {amount for
intra-Member State x number of journeys}
– land travel between 2 Member States (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600k where relevant):
{amount for inter-Member State travel x number of journeys}
– land travel between a Member State and a bordering country (50 – 399 km and 400 – 600
km where relevant): {amount for Member State and specific connection x number of
journeys}
All unit costs are an amount to cover a return trip. However, the calculation of the distance
should be done on the basis of the 1-way distance between the points.
For calculating the ‘distance’ between two points for land or air travel, beneficiaries must
use the distance calculators available on the Europa website.
88EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Enter start and end points of your travel. Do NOT enter intermediate stops, transfer
locations etc.
The distance calculators are mandatory. The distance produced by the calculators is the
only distance that can be used for the calculation of the unit costs — even if this does not
correspond to the actual distance of the travel.
Example: For example, the land travel calculator defines the distance between towns A and B as 380
km. However, because the train line deviates slightly to also serve town C, the actual distance travelled
is 410 km. For the purposes of the unit cost, only the distance of 380 km between towns A and B is
relevant (as calculated by the distance calculator).
The start and end-points entered will normally be the place of employment of the person and
the location of the meeting.
If, following the event, the person will travel to a place other than the start point, the amount
to be declared will be the theoretical cost of returning to the same starting point, unless the
different destination is necessary for the implementation of the action. In that case, the unit
cost can be calculated using the longer of the distances (e.g. if travel from Dublin – Brussels
– Athens is justified for the action, the unit cost to be applied can be calculated on basis of
the longer flight from Brussels – Athens).
Where the trip involves 3 journeys and is necessary for the implementation of the action (e.g.
Madrid – Brussels – Berlin – Madrid), the unit costs can be calculated on the basis of 2
separate return flights: Madrid – Brussels and Berlin – Madrid.
For checking the distance of travel to/from places more than 400km from a primary airport,
the following are the ‘primary airports’ to be used (— only relevant for calls with opening
date before 31 July 2024; for calls as from 31 July 2024, primary airports are no longer
relevant and instead the amount is determined solely by calculating the distance in the
normal way using the distance calculator):

Regarding accommodation:
The formula for calculating the accommodation is:
{amount per unit [depending on country]}
multiplied by
{nights spent on travel}
For the EU’s outermost regions or OCTs, the rate for the relevant Member State can be used
as a proxy amount (— only relevant for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024; for calls
with opening date as from 31 July 2024, specific unit costs for each OCT apply).
90EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, bear in mind that a new and extended list of
countries has been published in Annex 2a, and that this list contains a number of countries that
were not included in the list for previous calls.
Moreover, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is a specific unit cost for
’other countries’ that are not specifically mentioned in the list. Therefore, in practice there is now
a relevant unit cost to reimburse accommodation costs for any country in the world.
Regarding subsistence:
The formula for calculating the subsistence is:
{amount per unit [depending on country]}
multiplied by
{days spent on travel}
Subsistence unit costs are for a 24-hour period. The amount of unit costs to be declared
should be calculated by rounding up or down to the nearest full number of days, except for
the first day where any amount of hours will be rounded up to 1 full day.
For the EU’s outermost regions or OCTs, the rate for the relevant Member State can be used
as a proxy amount (— only relevant for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024; for calls
with opening date as from 31 July 2024, specific unit costs for each OCT apply).
The subsistence unit costs is intended to cover meals and other incidental expenses.
However, it is not necessary to verify whether the person already received a meal free of cost
(for example, a meal provided by the meeting/conference organiser or breakfast included in
the associated hotel amount; this does not impact the amount paid for the subsistence unit
cost).
For calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, bear in mind that a new and extended list of
countries has been published in Annex 2a, and that this list contains a number of countries that
were not included in the list for previous calls.
Moreover, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is a specific unit cost for
’other countries’ that are not specifically mentioned in the list. Therefore, in practice there is now
a relevant unit cost to reimburse subsistence costs for any country in the world.
Record-keeping — As regards record-keeping, the beneficiaries will have to be able to
prove (upon request) that an instance of travel took place and was linked to the action. The
beneficiaries do not need to keep specific records on the actual costs incurred, but must keep
adequate records and supporting documents to prove the number of units declared (see Article
20).
Example: Documents with a dated attendance list and description of the meeting can demonstrate that the
travel took place, was necessary for the action and occurred during the action duration. To be able to identify
the unit cost of each travel, the beneficiary could indicate on the attendance list the place of departure of the
persons for whom travel costs are claimed. In case of an event with no attendance list (a smaller/informal
meeting or event organised by a third party), the beneficiary must keep evidence to demonstrate that the
person travelled and that it was linked to the action: the agenda, email invitation, the minutes or report of
the event, the boarding pass, travel ticket, etc.
Specific cases (Travel and subsistence (C.1)):
Travel and subsistence for persons other than personnel (e.g. conference speakers,
visiting experts) (actual or unit cost) — Travel and subsistence costs may also be eligible
for persons that participate in the action on an ad-hoc basis (e.g. attending specific
91EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
meetings), if this complies with the general and specific eligibility conditions in Article 6.1 and
6.2.C, in particular being necessary for the implementation of the action, and:
− their participation is foreseen in Annex 1, or
− their participation is specifically justified in the periodic technical report and approved
by the granting authority (simplified approval procedure).
In line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel, the beneficiary may purchase itself or
reimburse these persons.
Carbon-offsetting (actual cost only) — Costs associated with carbon offsetting measures
can be eligible if they are in line with the beneficiary’s usual practices on travel (not just for
the EU action) and fulfil the general and specific cost eligibility conditions (e.g. incurred
during the action duration, in connection with the action as described in Annex 1 and the
underlying travel is necessary for the action’s implementation).
Air travel below 400 km (unit cost only) — Air travel below 400km is in principle not
reimbursed (participants are expected to use land travel for such distances and can charge
such land travel costs).
However, for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024, there is some flexibility to
reimburse air travel below 400km on the basis of actual costs incurred where land travel
would be not possible or appropriate. This may, for instance, be the case:
- where land travel is not available for a particular route (for example, travel from an
island to another island or from an island to the mainland)
- where land travel would involve an unusually long length of time (for example, an
anticipated journey time of seven hours or more (‘door to door’) for a one-way trip of
less than 399 km if there is a direct route by air travel as an alternative)
- where land travel is normally available but, due to unforeseen events, not available at
the time (for example, works on a train line meaning the train connection is cancelled;
proof of such circumstances should be kept on file).
Best practice: Beneficiaries who have queries in specific cases should contact the granting
authority (ideally before the travel is undertaken, but at the very latest before the costs are
submitted at the end of a reporting period). Costs for air travel for distances below 400 km
which have not been agreed with the granting authority may be rejected or adjusted to the
equivalent costs for land travel.
Travel by car (unit cost only) — Car travel below 50 km is NEVER eligible for
reimbursement using unit costs. However, it could be reimbursed using costs actually
incurred, where this is in line with the usual practices of the beneficiary.
For distances between 50 and 399 km, travel by car can be reimbursed as a form of land
travel (i.e. using the applicable ‘land travel’ unit costs).
For travel above 400 km, the situation depends on the call opening date:
− for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: car travel can NOT be reimbursed
using unit costs, but could be reimbursed on the basis of costs actually incurred,
where this is in line with the usual practices of the beneficiary
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: reimbursement of car travel above
400km using unit costs is possible where the travel took place in one of the land travel
connections for land travel between 50 and 399 km covered by authorising decision
C(2021)35; if there is no such land travel connection, then costs can be reimbursed
using costs actually incurred, where in line with and allowed by the beneficiaries usual
practices.
92EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
No matter the actual distance travelled, the reimbursement is limited to the unit cost for
land travel between 50 and 399 km.
Example: For example, a person drives from Frankfurt in Germany to Bern in Switzerland – a distance
of 420 km. Since there are unit costs for distances of 50 – 399 km for land travel between Germany and
Switzerland, this travel can be reimbursed with a unit cost amount of EUR 66. If the connection by car is
not covered by authorising decision C(2021)35, then costs can be reimbursed using costs actually
incurred, where in line with and allowed by the beneficiaries usual practices.
Destinations with different distances in the flight- and land travel calculators (e.g.
the flight calculator shows a distance below 400 km but the land travel calculator shows a
distance of more than 400km) (unit cost only) — In the unit cost system, reimbursement of
air travel is only possible where the travel is more than 400km, as calculated by the flight
calculator. Therefore, if the flight calculator shows a distance of 390 km, the travel costs can
NOT be reimbursed using the air travel unit costs.
Instead, the amounts to be claimed for this travel should be calculated according to the rules
for land travel. Thus, if for instance the land travel calculator shows a distance of 440 km, the
travel must be reimbursed using the relevant rules for land-based travel, i.e.:
− for calls with opening date before 31 July 2024: using the unit costs set out in Annex
2a for air, rail or combined air/rail (see table ’for travel of 400 km or more (air or rail
or combined air/rail)’)
− for calls with opening date as from 31 July 2024: using unit costs if there is a
corresponding unit cost for that travel (for example, land travel of 400 – 600 km
within France, or between Belgium and France, or between Germany and
Switzerland); if there is no applicable unit cost for that travel, then it can be
reimbursed on the basis of costs actually incurred.

1. Equipment costs (depreciation costs) (C.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility
conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the depreciation option (default option
for most programmes), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Equipment costs’ as
depreciation costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘depreciation only’ (NOT ‘depreciation
and full cost for listed equipment’ or ‘full cost and depreciation for listed equipment’; see
Data Sheet, Point 3). For those other options, see specific cases below.
In this case, this budget category covers the depreciation costs of equipment, infrastructure
or other assets used for the action. In addition, in some cases (e.g. infrastructure), it may
also include the costs necessary to ensure that the asset is ready for its intended use (e.g.
site preparation, delivery and handling, installation, etc).
What not? If the beneficiary’s usual practice is to consider durable equipment costs (or
some of them) as indirect costs, these can NOT be declared as direct costs, but are covered
by the flat rate for indirect costs (see Article 6.2.E). Any depreciation declared as a direct
cost under the action must be a direct cost under the beneficiary’s cost accounting practices
(see Article 6.2).
1.2 The costs must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.2, in
particular:
97EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts,
etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C and
− be written off in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual accounting practices and with
international accounting standards.
‘International accounting standards’ are an internationally recognised set of rules for
maintaining books and reporting company accounts, designed to be compared and
understood across countries.
Example: The IAS 16 (International Accounting Standards) or the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), originally created by the EU and now in common international use.
1.4 They must be calculated according to the following principles:
− the depreciable amount (purchase price) of the equipment must be allocated on a
systematic basis over its useful life (i.e. the period during which the equipment is
expected to be usable). If the equipment’s useful life is more than a year, the
beneficiary can NOT charge the total cost of the item in a single year
‘Useful life’ means the time during which the equipment is useful for the beneficiary. If
the beneficiary does not normally calculate depreciation, it may refer to its national
tax regulations to define the useful life of the equipment.
Declaring the full price in one single year would be considered either as not compliant
with the international accounting standards or as an excessive cost — and therefore in
both cases ineligible; see specific case ‘cash-based accounting’ below), except in case of
low-value assets (see below).
− depreciated equipment costs can NOT exceed the equipment’s purchase price
− if the beneficiary does not use the equipment exclusively for the action, only the
portion used on the action may be charged (the amount of use must be auditable)
Example:
A large 3D printer was bought before the action started and was not fully depreciated. For 6
months in reporting period 1 it was used for the action for 50 % of the time and for other
activities for the other 50 % of the time. Linear depreciation is applied according to the
beneficiary’s usual practices (depreciation over the expected period of use of the 3D printer):
EUR 100 000 per year (EUR 50 000 for 6 months).
Costs declared for the project: EUR 50 000 (6 months of use) multiplied by 50 % of use for the
action during those 6 months = EUR 25 000.
− the beneficiary can charge depreciation in line with applicable audit standards and its
usual accounting practices, i.e. normally at the earliest for periods as of the reception
of the equipment and its availability for use (i.e. when it is in the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management).
Example: A robot-supported equipment was bought on 15 November and received and set up
for use as of 01 December. The reporting period ends on 31 December and the financial year
also ends on 31 December. The maximum depreciation that the beneficiary may charge is 1
month (from 1 to 31 December); i.e. 1/12 of the annual depreciation. This applies even if the
beneficiary recorded in its accounts at 31 December a full year of depreciation for the item.
The depreciation costs must be calculated for each reporting period.
2. Equipment costs (full cost) (C.2): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions
— Calculation
98EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement with the full cost option (sometimes in HE,
RFCS, DEP, EDF, SMP, EU4H, EUAF, UCPM, RELEX; always in CEF, CCEI, HUMA), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Equipment costs’ as full costs.
In your Grant Agreement, this option is labelled ‘full cost only’ (NOT ‘depreciation and
full cost for listed equipment’ or ‘full cost and depreciation for listed equipment’; see Data
Sheet, Point 3). For those other options, see specific cases below.
Equipment that does not comply with the specific conditions for full cost (e.g. equipment
purchased prior to the action but used for the action) must be declared using the normal
depreciation cost.
In this case, the equipment costs cover the full capitalised costs for the equipment,
infrastructure or other assets to the grant.
‘Capitalised’ costs means recorded as assets in the beneficiary’s balance sheet. They may
relate to:
− the full purchase costs and/or
− the full development costs
and must be recorded under a fixed asset account in the beneficiary’s accounting records in
compliance with international accounting standards and the beneficiary’s usual cost
accounting practices.
2.2 The costs must be declared as actual costs.
2.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.2, in
particular:
− for full purchase costs:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts,
etc; see Article 6.1(a)) and
− have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C
Example: A beneficiary needs to buy an off-the-shelf equipment to perform some of its action
tasks. The related purchase costs are eligible if they comply with Article 6.2.C (i.e. ‘best value
for money/or lowest price’ and ‘no conflict of interests’ principles).
− for full development costs:
− depending on the nature of the cost items included in the development cost, fulfil the
general and specific cost eligibility conditions that would apply to the individual cost
item (for example, have been purchased in accordance with Article 6.2.C or fulfil the
specific conditions for personnel costs to be eligible Article 6.2.A).
Example:
A beneficiary is developing a prototype as part of its action tasks. For this purpose, it needs to
buy several components and rely on a service provider to assemble some specific parts of the
prototype. In that case, the related purchase costs are eligible if they comply with Article 6.2.C
(i.e. notably with the ‘best value for money/ or lowest price’ and ‘no conflict of interests’
principles).
The beneficiary has also its own employees involved in the assembling of the other parts of the
prototype. In that case, the related personnel costs are eligible if they comply with Article
6.2.A.1 (personnel costs for employees or equivalent appointing act).
2.4 They must be calculated according to the following principles:
99EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− correspond to the actual costs incurred in the purchase or for the development and
− ensure that there is no double charging of costs (in particular, no charging of
depreciation costs for the prototype or pilot plant to the grant or another EU grant).
They cover the full purchase/development costs (not only the depreciation costs for the
reporting period).
Specific cases (equipment costs (C.2)):
Depreciation and full costs for listed items (option in HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, SMP,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI, PERI, UCPM, RELEX) — If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement,
the beneficiaries can use depreciation for all items, except certain items listed in the Grant
Agreement for which you can charge full cost. For details, see above.
Full costs and depreciation for listed items (option in HE, RFCS, EDF, LIFE, SMP, UCPM)
— If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the beneficiaries may charge all items at
full cost, except the ones listed in the Grant Agreement for which you need to use
depreciation. For details, see above.
Full price of a low-value asset in one single year (depreciation) — If the option for
depreciation is activated, full cost of a low-value asset may exceptionally be eligible in the
year when it is purchased if:
− the full cost is recorded in the accounts of the entity in accordance with its usual
accounting practices as expenditure of that year (i.e. NOT recorded as an asset
subject to depreciation)
− the cost of the asset is below the low-value ceiling as defined under national law (e.g.
national tax legislation) or other objective reference compatible with the materiality
principle
and
− the item is used exclusively for the action in the year of purchase.
If the item is not used exclusively for the action in the year of purchase, only the portion
used on the action may be charged.
Equipment bought before the action starting date (depreciation) — If the option for
depreciation is activated, depreciation costs for equipment used for the action, but bought
before the action starting date are eligible if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions of
Article 6.1(a). The remaining depreciation costs (the equipment has not been fully
depreciated before the action’s start) may be eligible for the portion corresponding to the
action duration and to the rate of actual use for the purposes of the action.
Example: According to the beneficiary’s accounting practices, a piece of equipment bought in
January 2020 has a depreciation period of 48 months. If the action starts in January 2022 (when
24 months of depreciation have already passed) and the equipment is used for this action, the
beneficiary can declare the depreciation costs incurred for the remaining 24 months, in proportion
to the equipment’s use for the action.
Cash-based accounting — There are NO exceptions for cash-based accounting. If the
option for depreciation is activated, also beneficiaries with cash-based accounting may only
charge the annual depreciation costs that correspond to the part of the equipment’s use for
the action.They can NOT charge the full price in one single year — even if their usual
accounting practice is to record the equipment’s total purchase costs as an expense in one
year.
Example:
A beneficiary that uses cash-based accounting buys a machine for EUR 100 000 in March 2021.
According to the logbook of the machine, it is used for the action 50 % of the time from 1 July 2021
100EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
until the end of the action. The action started in January 2021 and runs for three years with two
reporting periods. The machine’s useful life is six years.
In the reporting period ending in June 2022, the beneficiary must declare depreciation costs taking
into account the percentage of use, the time used for the action and the machine’s useful life:
EUR 100 000 x (12/72 months) x 50 % (used for the action) = amount declared for the machine
in the first reporting period
In the reporting period ending in December 2023, the beneficiary must declare:
EUR 100 000 x (18/72 months) x 50 % (used for the action) = amount declared for the machine
in the second reporting period
Costs of renting or leasing of equipment, infrastructure or other assets
(depreciation and full cost) — If the equipment was not purchased but rented or leased,
the beneficiaries can charge the renting or leasing costs (i.e. finance leasing, renting and
operational leasing) — both if the option for depreciation or the full cost option are activated,
The costs must comply with the general and specific eligibility conditions (see Article 6.1(a)
and Article 6.2.C). The costs must be calculated according to the following principles :
− they must correspond to the actual eligible costs incurred for the renting or leasing
− they must not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment, infrastructure or
assets
− they must not include any financing fees (e.g. finance charges included in the finance
lease payments or interests on loans taken to finance the purchase)
− there must be no double charging of costs (e.g. no charging of depreciation costs for
equipment previously funded at full cost by an EU grant)
− where the Grant Agreement provides for depreciation: if equipment is not used
exclusively for the action, only the portion used on the action may be charged (the
amount of use must be auditable)
− where the Grant Agreement provides for full cost: in principle the full rental or lease
cost can be charged, irrespective of the portion used on the action. However, the cost
still cannot exceed depreciation costs of similar equipment/infrastructure/assets that
need to be determined based on the duration of the action (i.e. if you enter into a 5-
year lease at the start of a 3-year action, you may only charge cost up to the amount
of depreciation for three years).

C.3 Other goods, works and services
[OPTION 1 for programmes without costs for other goods, works and services (ineligible):
Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with costs for other goods, works and services (standard):
Purchases of other goods, works and services must be calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred.
Such goods, works and services include, for instance, consumables and supplies, promotion, dissemination,
protection of results, translations, publications, certificates and financial guarantees, if required under the
Agreement. ]
1. Costs of other goods, works and services (C.3): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge other purchases as ‘Other goods, works and
services’.
This budget category covers the costs for goods and services that were purchased for the
action, such as:
− costs for consumables and supplies (e.g. raw materials, office supplies)
− communication and dissemination costs (e.g. translation and printing costs or graphic
designer fees for printed products such as leaflets or other promotional items in
relation to communication activities; conference fees; costs for speakers and
interpreters)
− costs related to intellectual property rights (IPR) (e.g. costs related to protecting the
results such as consulting fees or fees paid to patent offices)
− costs for certificates on financial statements (CFS) and certificates on methodology
(CoMUC; where necessary)
− costs for financial guarantees (only if required by the granting authority; see Data
Sheet, Point 4.2).
Best practice: If there is any doubt about whether a cost is eligible, or whether a cost is to be
considered a purchase cost for other goods, works and services, the beneficiaries should
contact the granting authority.
What not? If it is the beneficiary’s usual accounting practice to consider some of these costs
(or all of them) as indirect costs, they cannot be declared as direct costs.
1.2 Costs of other goods, works and services must be declared as actual costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.C.3, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a)) and
102EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− be purchased specifically for the action and in accordance with Article 6.2.C.
1.4. Regarding the calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible costs actually
incurred (i.e. the amount paid by the beneficiary for the supply of the goods, works or
services).
Specific cases (costs for other goods, works and services (D.3)):
Supplies in stock — Supplies and consumables which were already in the stock of the
beneficiary may be eligible as a direct cost, if they are used for the action and fit the
definition of direct costs under Article 6.2.
Self-produced consumables with an accounting value in the inventory of the
beneficiary (i.e. not internally invoiced costs for goods and services) — Consumables that
are manufactured (produced) by the beneficiary itself do not have a purchase price; the cost
of production for the beneficiary is however normally recorded in the accounts of the
beneficiary (as part of the inventory). Therefore, the eligible costs of self-produced
consumables must be determined on the basis of its accounting value under the following
conditions:
− only the direct costs within the accounting value of the consumable (cost of
production) may be charged
and
− the amount resulting from the indent above may not be significantly higher than the
market price of the consumable.
Beneficiaries can NOT charge the commercial price of their self-produced consumables,
since it is not allowed to include a profit.
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — Costs for staff provided by a temporary
work agency are eligible normally under category C.3 Other goods and services if they
comply with the eligibility conditions (and unless the temporary work agency carries out
directly some task of the action, in which case it can be considered as subcontracting and
should be declared under category B. Subcontracting).
Communication and dissemination plans — The eligibility of costs for communication and
dissemination plans (e.g. HE plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results) depends
on their timing. Costs for the drawing up of plans that must be submitted together with the
proposal are normally NOT eligible since they will have been incurred before the start of the
action, to prepare the proposal. Costs for plans that are required only later or that occur
when revising or implementing the plan may be eligible if the eligibility conditions are
fulfilled.
Protection of results — Costs related to the protection of the action’s results may be
eligible if the eligibility conditions are fulfilled. However, costs related to protection of other
intellectual property (e.g. background patents) are NOT eligible.
IPR access rights (HE) — Royalties paid for IPR access rights (and by extension any lump
sum payments) may be eligible costs provided that all the eligibility conditions are fulfilled
(e.g. necessary for the implementation of the action, incurred during the action, reasonable,
etc).
The following are however NOT eligible (or eligible only within certain limits):
− royalties for an exclusive licence: are eligible only if it can be shown that the
exclusivity (and thus the higher royalties) is absolutely necessary for the
implementation of the action
103EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− royalties for licensing agreements which were already in force before the start of the
action: only the part of the licence fee that can be linked to the action is eligible (since
the licence presumably goes beyond the action implementation)
− royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries for
implementing the action: since the default rule is that access rights are granted on a
royalty-free basis and beneficiaries may deviate only if agreed before grant signature,
royalties may be eligible only if explicitly agreed by all beneficiaries before grant
signature
Best practice: If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is
recommended that this is explained in detail in their proposal.
− royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries for exploiting
the results and by extension royalties paid to third parties for exploitation of the
results: are NOT eligible.
Costs related to research output management (HE) — Costs for research output
management (e.g. management of research data) are eligible if the eligibility conditions are
fulfilled, including open access to peer-reviewed publications (but see the additional eligibility
condition referenced immediately below), research data and other outputs.
Open access to scientific publications (HE) — In addition to fulfilling the other costs
eligibility criteria, publication fees are ONLY eligible when publishing in full open access
publishing venues (see Annex 5 > Communication, dissemination and visibility).

105EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 6.2.D.1 > Financial support to third parties
D.1 Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (all programmes except RFCS,SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM)
D.1 Financial support to third parties
Costs for providing financial support to third parties (in the form of grants, prizes or similar forms of
support; if any) are eligible, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions, are calculated [on the basis of the costs actually incurred][as unit costs in accordance
with the method set out in Annex 2a] and the support is implemented in accordance with the conditions set
out in Annex 1.
These conditions must ensure objective and transparent selection procedures and include at least the
following:
(a) for grants (or similar):
(i) the maximum amount of financial support for each third party (‘recipient’); this amount
may not exceed the amount set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 3)30 or otherwise agreed
with the granting authority
(ii) the criteria for calculating the exact amount of the financial support
(iii) the different types of activity that qualify for financial support, on the basis of a closed list
(iv) the persons or categories of persons that will be supported and
(v) the criteria and procedures for giving financial support
(b) for prizes (or similar):
(i) the eligibility and award criteria
(ii) the amount of the prize and
(iii) the payment arrangements.
[This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate.]]
30 The amount must be specified in the call. It may not be more than 60 000 EUR, unless the objective of the action would otherwise be
impossible or overly difficult or in the case of humanitarian aid, emergency support operations, civil protection operations, or crisis
management aid (Article 207 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
1. Financial support to third parties (FSTP) (D.1): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes except RFCS, SMP ESS,
EUAF, CUST/FISC, CCEI, PERI, TSI, UCPM) AND provided for in the call conditions, the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs under ‘Financial support to third parties
(FSTP)’, where giving such support is part of the action activities.
This budget category covers ‘cascading’ grants, prizes or similar (meaning where the
beneficiaries of the EU grant cascade down (part of) the financial contribution to third parties,
so-called ‘recipients’).
For some programmes, the specific cost category in Article 6 is complemented by specific
rules in Annex 5 for carrying out the action within the meaning of Article 18 (see Annex 5 >
HE Co-funded Partnerships).
106EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Financial support to third parties may be given to natural persons (e.g. allowance,
scholarship, fellowship) or legal persons (e.g. non-repayable financial assistance to local
NGOs), seed money to start-ups or microcredit, or other forms. Also prizes can be given on
the basis of a contest organised by the beneficiary.
Examples:
1. An action in the area of sustainable agriculture and forestry includes financial support for
end-users (farmers) testing the technology developed within the action.
2. One of the work packages in Annex 1 includes funding for awarding three scholarships in the field
of the action.
3. A prize announced at the beginning of the action for identifying a (new) approach to dealing with
a technical implementation problem to be tackled at the end of the action.
4. A grant is given to a beneficiary foreseeing that the beneficiary should fund local NGOs which in
turn provide food vouchers and microcredits to natural persons in third countries.
The financial support scheme itself is NOT an EU action; the beneficiaries are providing the
financial support in their own name and under their own responsibility. When promoting the
EU action (see Article 17), the financial support must therefore NOT be presented as directly
provided by the EU.
What not? Support in kind (e.g. transfer of material for free) by the beneficiary to a third
party is NOT considered financial support.
This cost category can only cover financial support. By contrast, cost for non-financial
support or support given in-kind (e.g. vouchers) must be declared under other categories (e.g. as
cost for purchases of vouchers).
The recipients are NOT party to the Grant Agreement and therefore do NOT need to be listed
nor be registered in the Participant Register.
1.2 Costs of financial support to third parties must normally be declared as actual costs (or,
very exceptionally, as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a —
currently only for SMP COSME EYE and ERDF-TA IVY).
1.3 The actual costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.1,
in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc; see Article 6.1(a))
− respect the maximum amount of financial support to third parties as set out in the
description of the action (DoA; Annex 1) — normally up to EUR 60 000 per recipient,
but higher amounts are possible if necessary for the objectives of the action and
agreed with the granting authority (in the call conditions/Grant Agreement)
Systematic exceptions are foreseen for specific types of funding, such as humanitarian
aid, emergency support operations, civil protection operations, or crisis management aid
(see Article 207 FR 2024/2509).
and
− comply with the other conditions for the support that are set out in Annex 1, and in
particular:
− for cascading grants (or similar):
− the maximum amount per third party
107EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the criteria for determining the exact amount of financial support (e.g. EUR
2 000 per hectare; EUR 30 000 per student for a two-year scholarship)
Unless otherwise specified in the Grant Agreement, the financial support
provided by the beneficiaries may take any form (e.g. a lump sum or the
reimbursement of the costs incurred by the recipients when implementing the
supported activities); for the purposes of the EU grant, these remain however
actual costs.
− a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial
support for third parties (e.g. financial support for third parties allowed for
technology-testing activities)
These activities should benefit, primarily, the recipients (NOT the
beneficiaries).
− the persons or category(ies) of persons that may receive it (e.g. farmers; PhD
students, SMEs)
The procedures for selecting the recipients should be described in Annex 1.
− the criteria for giving financial support (e.g. physical characteristics of the
agricultural plots which make them suitable for the purpose of the action).
These criteria should respond to the objectives set out in the call conditions.
− for prizes:
− the amount of the prize (e.g. EUR 10 000)
− a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial
support to third parties and the award criteria for assessing the quality of
entries in light of the objectives and expected results
− the conditions for participation and the conditions for cancellation of the
contest, if any (e.g. eligibility and exclusion criteria; deadline for submission of
entries; possibility of jury interview)
The criteria must be objective.
− the payment arrangements (usually one payment).
− for other forms of financial support to third parties, at least:
− the maximum amount per recipient
− the criteria for determining the exact amount
− the types of activities to be funded
− the types of recipients eligible.
These conditions must also already be part of the proposal.
108EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The FSTP conditions (type of activities, eligible countries, etc) may have to follow similar
principles as those that apply to the beneficiaries themselves under the EU grant, if this is
provided in the call conditions (of the EU grant). These conditions must then also be specified in
the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1). Unless otherwise provided for in the call conditions,
financial support to third parties needs to be given directly from the EU grant beneficiary to the
(final) recipients, without further intermediaries.
The specific cost category in Article 6 is, for some programmes (HE, DEP, HUMA etc),
complemented by specific rules in Annex 5 for carrying out the action within the meaning of
Article 18.
1.4. Regarding the actual cost calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible costs
actually incurred (i.e. the amounts paid by the beneficiary for the cascading grants, prizes or
similar to the third parties during the duration of the action).
Specific cases (FSTP (D.1)):
(Micro)Loans and other financial instruments — If a call allows financial support to third
parties, directly or via implementing partners, in repayable form such as (micro)loans or
other financial instruments with a long-term character that exceed by their nature the
duration of the action and the EU Grant Agreement, Annex 1 must provide for specific
conditions on cost eligibility and acceptance.
For general guidance on financial support to third parties, see Guidance on good practices for
implementing FSTP in EU grants.

General > Article 6.2.D.2 > Internally invoiced goods and services
D.2 Internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF)
D.2 Internally invoiced goods and services
Costs for internally invoiced goods and services directly used for the action may be declared as unit cost
according to usual cost accounting practices, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions for such unit costs and the amount per unit is calculated:
(a) using the actual costs for the good or service recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts, attributed either
by direct measurement or on the basis of cost drivers, and excluding any cost which are ineligible or
already included in other budget categories; the actual costs may be adjusted on the basis of
budgeted or estimated elements, if they are relevant for calculating the costs, reasonable and
correspond to objective and verifiable information
and
(b) according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner, based on
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
‘Internally invoiced goods and services’ means goods or services which are provided within the beneficiary’s
organisation directly for the action and which the beneficiary values on the basis of its usual cost accounting
practices.
[This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate.]
1. Internally invoiced goods and services (D.2): Types of costs — Form —
Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (HE, DEP and EDF), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge costs under ‘Internally invoiced goods and
services’.
This budget category covers the costs for goods and services that the beneficiary itself
produced or provided for the action. They may include (non-exhaustive list):
− self-produced consumables (e.g. electronic wafers, chemicals)
− use of specific devices or facilities needed for the action (e.g. clean room, wind tunnel,
supercomputer facilities, electronic microscope, animal house, greenhouse, aquarium)
− standardised testing or research and development processes (e.g. genomic test, mass
spectrometry analysis)
− hosting services for visiting project team members participating in the action (e.g.
housing, canteen).
What not? Costs of goods or services purchased and costs of goods or services internally
invoiced which are not directly used for the action (e.g. supporting services like cleaning,
general accountancy, administrative support, etc).
1.2 The costs must be declared as unit costs in accordance with usual cost accounting
practices. The usual cost accounting practices must define both the unit (e.g. hour of use of
wind tunnel, one genomic test, one electronic wafer fabricated internally, etc) and the
methodology to determine the cost of the unit.
It is NOT necessary to have a document called ‘internal invoice’ to support these costs, but
the beneficiary should have a documented methodology how to determine them (such a
110EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
methodology must be part of its usual costs accounting practices). The beneficiary must also
keep supporting evidence of the use of the good or service for the action and showing the
number of units used.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.2, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the
action duration, necessary for the action, identifiable and verifiable, etc; see Article
6.1(b))
− be in line with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices and
− the cost accounting practices must have been applied in a consistent manner, based
on objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
It must be the usual practice of the beneficiary to calculate a unit cost for that good or
service. The unit costs is the internal cost per unit that is charged between departments of
the same entity; it is not the price charged in the context of commercial sales or to grants
from other fund providers.
The beneficiary must consistently apply its usual cost accounting practices to calculate the
unit cost, based on objective criteria that must be verifiable if there is a check, audit, review
or investigation. You must do this no matter who is funding the action.
Example (ineligible): If you set up a new unit cost which applies only to EU actions, the
internally invoiced costs based on that new unit cost would be ineligible as they would not be your
usual cost accounting practice.
Example (eligible): If you make adjustments to comply with the Grant Agreement because the
usual methodology includes an ineligible cost item, the adjusted methodology will still be
considered as your usual cost accounting practice and not as a new unit cost.
1.4 The costs must be calculated using the actual costs recorded in the beneficiary’s
accounts, excluding any ineligible costs or costs already included in other budget categories:
− if necessary, the unit cost must be adjusted to remove:
− cost elements that are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (even if they are
part of the beneficiary’s usual methodology for determining the unit cost for its
internal invoices)
Example: The beneficiary uses internal invoices for the use of an electronic microscope
based on a unit cost per hour of use. The methodology to calculate the unit cost
includes costs of capital (e.g. interest charged by the bank for a loan used to buy the
microscope). Those costs are ineligible under the Grant Agreement (see Article 6.3) and
must therefore be removed. The unit cost must be recalculated without them.
You can NOT simply apply an estimated percentage of deduction on the amount
of your internal invoices to remove ineligible costs. You have to ensure that the
internal invoice does not include any ineligible costs.
− costs of resources that do not belong to the beneficiary and which it uses free
of charge (e.g. personnel or equipment of a third party provided free of
charge), because those costs are not in its accounts (see Article 6.1(a)(v))
− costs that are already included in other budget categories (double funding of
the same costs, see Article 6.1(a)(i))
Example: The beneficiary uses internal invoices for water chemistry analyses, based on
a unit cost per water sample analysed. The methodology to calculate the unit cost
includes the cost of the staff carrying out the analysis. However, the costs for those
111EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
persons are already charged to the action under direct personnel costs (category A.1).
The cost of the staff must therefore be removed and the unit cost must be recalculated
without them.
− if budgeted or estimated elements were included in the calculation of the amount per
unit, those elements must:
− be relevant (i.e. clearly related to invoiced item)
− be used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not play major role in calculating the unit
cost)
− correspond to objective and verifiable information (i.e. their basis is clearly
defined and the beneficiary can show how they were calculated)
− only the share of the actual costs that are used for the production of the internally
invoiced good or service may be included in the pool of costs used to determine the
cost per unit; the share of these costs must be calculated by direct measurement
(‘direct costs’). The pool must not include any indirect costs (except for in HE, see
specific cases below), in particular not general administrative costs
Allocation keys resulting in a higher unit cost for the internally invoiced good or
service when used in EU grants compared with other projects will NOT be accepted.
Impact on horizontal 215-days ceiling — The share of the cost of a cost item
included in the internal invoice reduces the share of the cost item that can be charged as
direct costs to EU actions. For example, the share of the working time of a person that is
included in the calculation of the unit cost reduces the number of day-equivalents that the
person can charge over the year to EU grants (see Article 6.2.A).
Double funding risk — The same time of the person can NOT be charged twice to the
grant, i.e. it can NOT be once embedded in the unit cost and again as direct personnel
costs.
Example (costs for use of an animal housing facility):
Generally eligible as part of the unit cost:
– staff working for the facility (e.g. keepers, veterinarians and other persons directly
assigned to run the animal house)
– consumables used for the animal housing (e.g. animal food, bedding)
– depreciation of cages and other equipment directly used to the housing of the animals
– generic supplies like electricity or water used in the facility
– specific maintenance and cleaning of the animal house facility
– costs of shared infrastructures where the animal housing is located (e.g. central heating,
air-conditioning system) and their shared maintenance costs, allocated via usual key
driver
– shared services with allocation of the costs incurred for the animal house facility via usual
key driver (e.g. shared cleaning services of the building where the animal housing is
located)
– depreciation costs of shared buildings allocated via usual key driver (e.g. if the animal
housing is part of a main building of the beneficiary)
Generally ineligible as part of the unit cost:
– bank interests
– provisions for future expenses
– cost declared under other cost categories (e.g. personnel cost, equipment depreciation
cost) and indirect cost (e.g. facility management costs allocated on the basis of the
square meters the shelter occupies, general administrative costs such as those
stemming from the HR, legal or accounting departments)
– any other ineligible costs (see Article 6.3)
112EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example (costs for use of a wind tunnel facility):
Generally eligible as part of the unit cost:
– staff working for the facility (e.g. technicians, engineers and other persons directly
assigned to the functioning of the wind tunnel)
– depreciation of the equipment, including specific software and hardware necessary for the
functioning of the wind tunnel
– generic supplies like electricity used for the wind tunnel
– insurance of the wind tunnel (or the premises in which it is located)
– specific maintenance and cleaning of the wind tunnel equipment (e.g. air cooling system)
– calibration/metrology tests of the wind tunnel
– costs of shared infrastructures where the wind tunnel is located, allocated via usual key
driver (e.g. central heating, air-conditioning system) and their related shared
maintenance costs
– depreciation costs of shared buildings allocated via usual key driver (e.g. if the building
where the wind tunnel is located is part of a main building of the beneficiary)
Generally ineligible as part of the unit cost:
– bank interests
– provisions for future expenses
– cost declared under other cost categories (e.g. personnel cost, equipment depreciation
cost) and indirect cost (e.g. power supply costs allocated to a clean room on the basis of
the square meters it occupies, general administrative costs such as those stemming from
the HR, legal or accounting departments)
– any other ineligible costs (see Article 6.3)
Double funding risk — The same time of the person can NOT be charged twice to the grant,
i.e. it can NOT be once embedded in the unit cost and again as direct personnel costs.
Specific cases (costs of internally invoiced goods and services (D.2)):
Actual direct and indirect costs (HE) — If part of the usual cost accounting practices,
beneficiaries may calculate the share of the actual costs that are used for the production of
the internally invoiced good or service either by direct measurement (‘direct costs’; see
above) or by using the allocation keys defined in the costs accounting practices (‘indirect
costs’) (e.g. power supply costs allocated to a clean room on the basis of the square meters it
occupies, general administrative costs such as those stemming from the HR, legal or
accounting departments).
Co-owned resources— As an exception, if the resource for which the unit cost is calculated
is co-owned by the beneficiary and a third party, the costs registered in the accounts of the
third party for the co-owned resource do not need to be removed if:
− the third party is mentioned in the grant (e.g. as beneficiary, affiliated entity or, for
HE, third party providing in-kind contributions in Annex 1) and
− the costs fulfil the other eligibility conditions of this Article (e.g. directly linked to the
resource, exclude ineligible costs, etc).

1. HE Transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure unit costs (D.3 and
D.4): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 This cost category will be inserted for the Horizon Europe standard types of action (e.g.
RIA, CSA, COFUND, etc) that involve transnational and/or virtual access to research
infrastructure for scientific communities (‘provision of access activities’), in particular calls
under Part III of the HE Work Programme, ‘Research Infrastructures’.
This cost category is optional. Beneficiaries can declare their access costs either as unit
costs under this cost category OR simply as actual costs under another fitting cost category
(e.g. purchase cost), OR — where duly justified and subject to certain conditions — as a
combination of unit costs and actual costs.
The specific cost category in Article 6 is complemented by specific rules in Annex 5 for
carrying out the action within the meaning of Article 18 (see Annex 5 > HE access for
research infrastructure activities).
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘transnational or virtual
access to research infrastructure unit costs’.
The budget category covers direct and indirect access costs for providing transnational access
to research infrastructure (i.e. the installation’s operating costs and costs related to logistical,
technological and scientific support for users, including ad-hoc user training and the
preparatory and closing activities needed to use the installation).
114EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What not? Travel and subsistence costs for users to get transnational access are not
included in the access costs. These costs can be reimbursed separately, in category C.1
Travel and subsistence; see Article 6.2.C.1.
1.2 If declared under this budget category, the costs must be declared as unit costs, using
the unit cost table (rates per unit of access) agreed with the granting authority (see HE RI
authorising decision16 and Annex 2a and 2b).
The ‘unit of access’ must be identified for each installation (i.e. the unit used to measure the
quantity of access that the installation provides to its users).
The precise unit cost (amount per unit, i.e. EUR/unit of access) is not prefixed by the
authorising decision. It must be calculated for each access provider and installation (you can
use the calculators (calculator HE UN RI TA and calculator HE UN RI VA) provided on the call
page) and then summarised in the table ‘Summary of transnational/virtual access provision’
in the proposal and in the unit cost table in Annex 2b of the Grant Agreement:
Short name Short Installation Unit of Amount Estimated Total unit
access name access per unit No of units cost
provider infrastru No Short name (cost per unit
cture x estimated
no of units)
The summary table in the proposal is generic (must be filled in for all proposals giving access
to research infrastructure, even if they do not use the unit cost). Annex 2b is needed only for
actions that use the unit cost.
The formula for calculating the amount per unit (unit of access rate) is:
− for transnational access:
{average annual total access costs to the installation (over past two years)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
average annual total quantity of access to the installation (over past two years)}
− for virtual access:
{total virtual access costs to the installation (over the last year)
_ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
total quantity of virtual access to the installation (over the last year)}
The averages must be based on:
− the beneficiary’s certified or auditable historical data
− costs allocated to the installation according to the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting
practices (including where the installation has been in operation for less than two
years) and
16 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
115EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− a period excluding times when the installation was not usable (out of order, under repair
or undergoing long-term maintenance).
In exceptional and duly justified cases, the granting authority may agree with a beneficiary to
use a different reference period than the ones referred to above (two years for transnational
access and one year for virtual access).
The ‘total quantity of access’ means all the units of access annually provided by the installation,
included access financed under previous EU grants, if any.
The ‘annual total access costs to the installation’ is calculated on the basis of the following
categories of eligible costs:
− the direct costs incurred by the access provider for the ‘annual total quantity of access to
the installation’, as recorded in the certified or auditable profit-and-loss accounts of the
reference period for:
− personnel costs of administrative, technical and scientific staff directly assigned to
the functioning of the installation and to the support of the users
− costs of contracts for maintenance and repair (including specific cleaning, calibrating
and testing) specifically awarded for the functioning of the installation (if not
capitalised)
− costs of consumables specifically used for the installation and the user’s research
work
− costs of contracts for installation management, including security fees, insurance
costs, quality control and certification, upgrading to national and/or EU quality,
safety or security standards (if not capitalised) specifically incurred for the
functioning of the installation
− costs of energy power and water supplied for the installation where it can be verified
as being supplied exclusively for the installation and as being a major cost item for
the installation
− costs of general services when they are specifically included in the provided access
services (e.g. library costs, shipping costs, transport costs)
− costs of software licence, internet connection or other electronic services for data
management and computing when they are needed to provide access services
− costs of specific scientific services included in the access provided or needed for the
provision of access
− the indirect costs for providing access to the installation, equal to 25% of the eligible direct
costs
AND excluding:
− all contributions to the capital investments of the installation (including rental, lease
or depreciation costs of buildings as well as depreciation and lease of
instrumentation); those costs are not eligible unless otherwise specified in the work
programme/call conditions, in which case only the portion used to provide access
under the action can be eligible
− travel and subsistence costs for users
− ineligible costs as referred to in Article 6.3.
Example (amount per unit):
Assuming that a telescope provided 6 100 hours of access in year N-1 and 5 900 hours of
access in year N-2 and that the total access costs (for the provision of these total quantities of
access) in the two years calculated on the basis of the categories of costs indicated above (with
the exclusion of any contribution to capital investment and of travel and subsistence costs of
users) is respectively EUR 3 200 000 and EUR 2 800 000, then the unit cost is
Average costs = average (3 200 000, 2 800 000) = 3 000 000
Average hours = average (6 100, 5 900) = 6 000
Unit cost = average (3 200 000, 2 800 000) / average (6 100, 5 900) = 3 000 000 /6 000 =
500 €
116EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The detailed calculations used (one calculator sheet for each installation) must be kept by
beneficiaries as supporting documents in case of audits.
The granting authority may verify that the proposed unit costs comply with the prescribed
calculation method (and correct them, if needed).
The proposal and Annex 1 should describe the access services provided and the logistical,
technological and scientific support given to users (including ad-hoc training and preparatory
and closing activities necessary to use the installation).
As mentioned above, the use of unit costs for transnational and virtual access activities is
optional, i.e. each access provider can decide for each installation whether to be reimbursed
on the basis of unit costs, actual costs or a combination of the two. This decision must be
taken before grant signature and applied consistently throughout the action. In duly justified
cases, for example when there are significant variations in the costs for providing access, it
can be updated through an amendment with the agreement of the granting authority.
Double funding risk — Costs that are declared as a specific unit cost can NOT be declared a
second time under another budget category (for the costs that are covered, see below).
Example: A same cost item (e.g the salary of a member of the research infrastructure staff) cannot be used
for calculating the unit cost and then charged as actual cost under personnel costs.
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.D.3 and
6.2.D.4, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1 (b))
− be incurred for providing transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure to
scientific communities.
1.4 They must be calculated, for each access provider and installation, , in accordance with
the methodology set out in the authorising decision and Annex 2a.
The formula for calculating the transnational or virtual access to research infrastructure unit
costs is:
{amount per unit [rate per unit of access set out in Annex 2b]}
multiplied by
{number of actual units of access provided}
The unit of access rate is fixed by the granting authority, based on the rates proposed by the
beneficiaries in Annex 2b (see above).

D.5 HE PCP/PPI procurement costs
[OPTION for HE PCP/PPI: D.5 PCP/PPI procurement costs
PCP/PPI procurement costs are eligible, if and as declared eligible in the call conditions, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions, are calculated on the basis of the costs actually incurred and:
- are incurred for a joint pre-commercial procurement or joint or coordinated public procurement of
innovative goods and services targeted by the action and described in Annex 1 and
- the procurement is carried out by a ‘contracting authority/entity’ as defined in the EU public
procurement Directives (in particular, Directives 2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU and 2009/81/EC).
The beneficiaries must award the procurement contracts to the tender(s) offering best value for money and
use objective and transparent procedures which — unless otherwise provided in the call conditions —
include:
- if a preliminary market consultation is carried out: the publication of a prior information notice about
the consultation in the Official Journal of the European Union
- the publication of a contract notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
- the publication of a contract award notice within 48 days after concluding the contract(s) in the
Official Journal of the European Union
in English and any additional language(s) chosen by the beneficiaries.
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security reasons, the beneficiaries must
ensure that the performance of the contract takes place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in
the call conditions — unless otherwise approved by the granting authority.
For PPI procurements, beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU
Directives on public procurement must also comply with these Directives and the applicable national law on
public procurement.
The beneficiaries which act as procurers (i.e. the buyers group and the lead procurer), the object and
estimated cost for each procurement and the estimated financial contribution per member of the buyers group
must be set out in Annex 1 and the estimated procurement costs per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2.
The costs for the cost categories other than procurement costs are eligible only up to 50% of the total
estimated eligible costs of the action set out in Annex 2.
This cost will not be taken into account for the indirect cost flat-rate. ]

1. HE PCP/PPI procurement costs (D.5): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility
conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? This cost category will be inserted for Horizon Europe PCP/PPI actions (i.e. calls
with PCP/PPI ToA).
118EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This cost category is used ONLY for calls that run as PCP/PPI type of action (i.e. where
also the Annex 5 > HE PCP and PPI procurements provisions apply).
For these calls, the rules for subcontracts and subcontractors in Article 6.2.B and
Article 9.3 do NOT apply for the PCP or PPI procurement. Costs must be charged under
Article 6.2.D.5 (new for 2021-2027).
Other types of calls (RIA, IA, CSA, etc) are NOT subject to Article 6.2.D.5 (nor to
Annex 5) —even if projects should include PCP or PPI activities. For them, the PCP/PPI
activities must be handled as subcontracting in accordance with Article 6.2.B and Article
9.3.
However, for BOTH groups, the detailed provisions in General Annex H of the HE Work
Programme apply. If you plan to implement PCP or PPI activities in a Horizon Europe
action, you should therefore always first look at the General Annex.
For these actions, the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘PCP/PPI procurement
costs’.
This budget category ‘covers only the costs of the PCP/PPI procurement (i.e. the price of the
PCP/PPI procurement paid to the PCP/PPI providers, including related duties, taxes and
charges, such as non-deductible, non-refundable value added tax (VAT)). Only costs of R&D
services (PCP) or innovative solutions (PPI) procured by the beneficiaries are eligible.
Be aware that different duties, taxes and charges (in particular also a different VAT rate)
may apply depending on the payment set-up for the procurement (centralised or
decentralised payments).
What not? It does not cover the costs for the additional activities related to the PCP/PPI
procurement.
‘Additional activities’ are the activities needed to prepare, manage and follow-up the PCP/PPI
procurement (including testing of solutions by the lead procurer, buyers group, or other end-
users) and further activities to embed the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side activities.
Some of those are a mandatory part of the EU action (e.g. the activities needed to coordinate
and implement the PCP/PPI procurement; see mandatory deliverables defined in General
Annex H of the HE Work Programme); others are optional (e.g. activities to embed the
PCP/PPI procurement into a wider set of demand side activities), unless otherwise specified in
the work programme/call conditions.
Examples (other additional activities): Activities that aim to remove barriers to introducing an
innovative solution on the market (including standardisation, certification and regulation); activities
that prepare the ground for cooperation on future PCP or PPI projects; awareness raising and
experience sharing/training.
Costs for additional activities must always be charged under the fitting standard cost
categories, even when they involve the procurement of (non PCP/PPI) goods or services.
Example (additional activities):
Personnel costs: Costs incurred by the lead procurer, buyers group and other consortium
participants for consulting the market, preparing the call for tender documents etc must be
charged under cost category A.
Subcontracting costs: For web design or publicity campaign to promote the PCP/PPI
procurement, for external experts that support the buyers group in evaluation of tenders must be
charged under cost category B.
Purchase costs: For travel tickets, consumables and equipment that needs to be bought by the
buyers group to test innovative solutions of the providers that win the PCP/PPI contracts must be
charged under cost category C.
119EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Financial support to third parties (FSTP): To award a prize to the solution provider(s) that
performed best in the PCP/PPI procurement must be charged under cost category D.
In-kind contributions (free of charge): Potential end-users of the solutions (e.g. fire brigade)
may make available personnel/equipment to the buyers group (e.g. Ministry of interior) to help test
innovative solutions. For HE PCP/PPI actions, the costs of the personnel/equipment may be
declared as eligible costs by the beneficiaries which use them under the standard cost categories A
and C.2, as if they were their own (see Article 6.1).
Indirect costs for the PCP/PPI procurement costs are also NOT reimbursed.
1.2 PCP/PPI procurement costs must be declared as actual costs (i.e. the price actually
paid).
1.3 The ‘PCP/PPI procurement costs’ must fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article
6.2.D.5, in particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a))
− be incurred for the PCP/PPI procurement described in Annex 1
− be based on the best value for money
− not be subject to conflict of interest
− awarded following objective and transparent procedures that comply with certain
minimum conditions and
− for PPI: for beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’
within the meaning of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directives 2014/24/EU,
2014/25/EU and 2009/81/EC): comply with these Directives and the applicable
national law on public procurement
For PCP/PPI procurements, the contracts may NOT be awarded based on the lowest
price as the only award criterion. In addition to the price, it is mandatory to take into
account also the quality of the proposed innovative solutions in the evaluation of the
tenders.
The minimum procedural conditions explicitly mentioned in Article 6 include obligations to
publish in the OJEU (TED portal) — at least in English (and in any additional languages
chosen by the beneficiaries) — prior information notices (PIN) to announce the open market
consultation and the upcoming PCP/PPI procurement, as well as contract notices and contract
award notices for the PCP/PPI call for tenders.
Regarding deadlines for publication of notices, we will consider as the ‘date of publication’
the date when you submitted the notice to the OJEU Publication Office.
Additional transparency requirements (including timing and exceptions) are set out in Annex
5 > PCP and PPI procurements and General Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
For general guidance on PCP/PPI types of action in HE, see How to set up and manage HE PCP
and PPI grants, HE Programme Guide > Innovation Procurement and General Annexes B and H of
the HE Work Programme.
120EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For PCP procurements, the EU Public Procurement Directives normally do not apply (because
exempted17). However, national laws on public procurement may apply if they have rules for
this type of R&D service contracts. For PPI procurements, both the EU Directives and the
national laws apply.
The beneficiaries which act as procurers (i.e. the buyers group and the lead procurer), the
object and estimated cost for each procurement and the estimated financial contribution per
member of the buyers group must be justified in Annex 1. There is NO simplified approval
procedure).
Finally, there is a cost eligibility ceiling: PCP/PPI procurement costs must amount to a
minimum of 50% of the total estimated costs of the action in the budget table, and all
additional costs can amount to maximum 50% of the costs. This is due to the fact that the
PCP/PPI procurement should be the main objective of PCP/PPI actions.
The maximum amount for additional activities is fixed at Grant Agreement signature, based
on all the estimated eligible costs of the action. The maximum amount of EU funding for
additional activities therefore does NOT change (i.e. will NOT be reduced by the granting
authority) when at the end of the action it turns out that the costs actually incurred for
PCP/PPI procurement are less than initially estimated (e.g. if the buyers group is able to
procure at a better price than it had initially budgeted).
1.4 Regarding the calculation, the amount charged as eligible cost must correspond to the
price invoiced for the PCP/PPI procurement(s).

− fulfil the general conditions for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred/units used during the
action duration, necessary for the action, identifiable and verifiable, etc; see Article
6.1(a) and (b))
− fulfil the eligibility conditions for the underlying types of costs in question (i.e.
subcontracting, financial support to third parties (FSTP) and internally invoiced goods
and services)
− be incurred for activities eligible for additional funding and for the objectives for which
it was awarded.
2.4. Regarding the calculation, the costs must correspond to the eligible (unit or actual)
costs incurred and must be calculated according to the rules applicable to the type of cost in
question.
Specific cases (ERC additional costs (D.7 and D.8)):
Simplified approval procedure (ERC additional costs) — If you need to make some
changes in relation to the additional funding granted, the coordinator must request an
amendment in order to change the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure; for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the
beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting authority might not approve the change
and reject the costs at interim or final payment-stage later on. It is highly recommended to
contact the granting authority before deciding on any change.
Examples (change that could be accepted):
1. The additional funding was awarded to purchase a particular piece of major equipment. During
the implementation of the action, the PI proposes to use the additional funding to acquire a newly
developed equipment that would allow the research team to carry out the action tasks in a more
efficient manner. This change could be accepted.
2. The additional funding was awarded to carry out a sociological experiment in three European
countries. During the implementation of the action, the PI proposes to enlarge the scope of the
funded research and to include a fourth non-European country in the abovementioned
experiment. This change could be accepted.
Examples (change that would not be accepted):
123EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. The additional funding was awarded to finance a scientific expedition to Antarctica. After
successfully executing the expedition, the PI proposes to use remaining additional funding to
purchase equipment for the action. This change would not be accepted.
2. The additional funding was awarded to cover the internally invoiced access to large facilities of
the beneficiary. During the implementation of the action, the PI proposes to use the additional
funding to recruit new team members in order to explore and develop alternative lines of
research. This change would not be accepted.

The entity’s statutes must include a provision that, in case of dissolution,
the land will be transferred to another legal body primarily active in the field
of nature conservation (e.g. another conservation NGO or appropriate public
body).
− for purchases of partial rights: the entry into the land register must duly reflect
the long term nature conservation objectives and the requirements set out in
Article 6.2.D.2 of the Grant Agreement
− for land purchased to be exchanged at a later date for another parcel on which
the action will be undertaken: the exchange must be carried out before the end
of the action and the land exchanged must comply with the requirements set
out in Article 6.2.D.2 of the Grant Agreement.
For long-term leases:
− the lease must be of at least 20 years (unless provided otherwise in the call
conditions)
− the lease must include provisions and commitments that ensure the
achievement of its objectives in terms of habitat and species protection.
Land purchases must be done by one of the project participants who is either a well-
established private organisation (e.g. nature conservation NGO or other) or a public body
with nature conservation responsibility, and must remain in its ownership after the end of the
project.
The purchased land must be the subject, during the action, of specific restoration and/or
active management or restrictions of use that go beyond existing legal obligations or existing
restrictions that could be imposed without purchasing the land. The purchase of land that is
already in excellent conservation status (i.e. that requires no restoration or specific
management or restrictions of use) is eligible only very exceptionally, if indispensable for the
objectives of the project.
Evidence must be provided that the land (to be) purchased was not owned by a public
authority in the 24 months before the project application was submitted to the EU.
Compliance with all applicable conditions must be specifically demonstrated in the proposal.
In particular, proposals are expected to include:
131EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− evidence that the purchase price is consistent with the market price for the type of
land and the region concerned (e.g. letter from competent authority, registered
notary, real estate agent, etc)
− In case of land purchase, long term lease and one-off compensations, the
beneficiaries need to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness already at proposal stage.
During the project (and at the latest with the final report), we will require a copy of the sales
contract and/or entry in the land register, including the guarantee related to the long-term
conservation. For countries that do not allow to include such guarantee in land registers and
sales contract, you will be required to provide an equivalent guarantee, with the same legal
level of protection in the long term.

1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (all programmes; except CEF, CCEI and
some LIFE and EUAF calls), the beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge the ‘Indirect
costs’.
This budget category covers all costs for the action that are not directly linked to it (i.e.
overheads).
1.2 Indirect costs are declared as a fixed flat-rate (except EDF). For most programmes the
flat-rate is fixed at 7% of the eligible direct costs in accordance with Article 184(6) EU
Financial Regulation 2024/250920; for some programmes, a higher rate is foreseen in the
Programme Regulation (basic act; see specific cases below)).
1.3 The costs must comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.2.E, in
particular:
− fulfil the general conditions for flat-rate costs to be eligible (i.e. costs to which the flat-
rate is applied must be eligible, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1(c))
1.4 The costs must be calculated by applying the 7% flat-rate to the eligible costs
(categories A-D, except volunteers costs and exempted specific cost categories, if any).
The calculation itself is automated: The indirect cost amount is prefilled by the IT system.
Beneficiaries can change the amount, if they would like to request less indirect costs (for
instance, because they have a parallel EU operating grant and are not able to demonstrate
cost separation; see specific cases below).
Specific cases (indirect costs (E.))
25% indirect cost flat-rate (HE, SME COSME EEN, EDF) — If this option is activated in the

− EUR 100 000 personnel costs
− EUR 20 000 subcontracting costs
− EUR 10 000 other goods and services (consumables).
Eligible direct costs: 100 000 + 20 000 + 10 000 = EUR 130 000
Eligible indirect costs: 25 % of (100 000 + 10 000) = EUR 27 500
Total eligible costs: EUR 157 500
Other indirect cost flat-rates (RFCS, AGRIP, SMP ESS) — If other options are activated in
the Grant Agreement, the system will automatically calculate the indirect costs using those
flat-rates (e.g. RFCS 35%, AGRIP 4%, SMP ESS 30% all on category A. Personnel costs,
except volunteers costs).
Actual indirect costs (EDF) — If provided for in the call conditions, the beneficiaries may
charge actual indirect cost in accordance with the rules of the Grant Agreement (instead of a
flat-rate). Only beneficiaries whose usual cost accounting practices to calculate indirect costs
are accepted by national authorities for comparable activities in the defence domain can use
this option. This means that if your national authorities do not accept actual indirect costs for
national contracts (e.g. they accept only a simplification option like flat-rates) or you have
not carried out comparable activities in the defence domain under national contracts, you
cannot use this option. Different beneficiaries within the same action may choose different
options for their indirect costs.
Combining of EU action and operating grants — Beneficiaries that have parallel EU
action grants and operating grants may claim indirect costs in their action grants ONLY if they
are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that their operating grants do not cover any
costs which are covered by their action grants).
‘Operating grants’ are not always easy to identify. They exist under various labels (operating
grants; financial contributions/support to the functioning/operation of entities; etc). Check
your call conditions.
Example: Operating grants are grants awarded to support the running costs of certain institutions
pursuing an aim of European interest, such as: College of Europe, European standards bodies
(CEN, CENELEC, ETSI).
To demonstrate cost separation, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
− the operating grant may NOT cover 100% of the beneficiary’s annual budget (i.e. it
may not be a full operating grant)
− the beneficiary must use analytical accounting which allows for a cost accounting
management with cost allocation keys and cost accounting codes AND must apply
these keys and codes to identify and separate the costs (i.e. to allocate them to either
the action grant activities or the operating grant activities)
− the beneficiary must record:
− all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by their operating
grants (i.e. personnel, general running costs and other operating costs linked
to the operating grant work programme of activities) and
− all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by the action grant
(including the real indirect costs linked to the action)
137EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the allocation of the costs must be done in a way that leads to a fair, objective and
realistic result.
Beneficiaries that cannot fulfil these conditions must either:
− keep the operating grant, but sign the action grant without indirect costs or request
no indirect costs at reporting stage (i.e. lower the pre-filled amount in the indirect cost
column of the financial statement)
or
− renounce to the operating grant, in order to be able to claim the indirect costs in the
action grant.
Best practice: In case of overlapping EU action and operating grants, contact the granting
authority for advice.

1. Contributions (F.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation
1.1 What? If eligible under the Grant Agreement (currently not in any programme), the
beneficiaries/affiliated entities may charge ‘Contributions’.
Contributions are simplified forms of output based funding. They are normally based on an
approximation of the costs, calculated ex-ante, and paid on the basis of pre-defined mile
stones/work packages. However, contrary to simplified costs (e.g. unit cost), they do not
work with funding rates (because the contribution already incorporates the funding rate in
the ex-ante calculation of the amount). This means that there is no need to apply any
funding rate to the amount claimed by the recipient in a request for payment.
139EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Currently no EU programme uses simplified contributions inside their actual cost grants (i.e.
all budget categories are calculated with a funding rate).
By contrast, full lump sum or unit grants (e.g. in HE, DEP, CEF, INNOVFUND, JTM, etc) are
usually contribution-based (meaning no funding rate needed in the budget table in Annex 2).

31 For the definition, see Article 183(2)(b) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: ‘operating grant’ means an EU grant to finance “the
functioning of a body which has an objective forming part of and supporting an EU policy”.
32 Condition must be specified in the call.
1.Types of ineligible costs and contributions
What? Costs and contributions are ineligible, if one of the following applies:
− they do not meet the general and specific eligibility conditions set out in Articles 6.1
and 6.2
Examples: Bonuses paid by participants that do not fulfil the conditions set out in Article 6.2;
subcontracting costs that do not comply with Article 6.2.
− they are listed in Article 6.3, in particular:
− costs related to return on capital or dividends paid by a beneficiary
Example: Dividends paid as remuneration for investing in the action; remuneration paid
as a share in the company’s equity.
− debt and debt service charges
‘Debt service’ is the amount paid on a loan in principal and interest, over a
period of time.
Example: A beneficiary takes a loan used to acquire equipment or consumables for the
project of EUR 100 000 at 9 percent interest for 10 years, the debt service for the first
year (principal and interest) is EUR 15 582 and cannot be declared as eligible cost.
− provisions for future losses or debts
‘Provision’ means an amount set aside in an organisation’s accounts, to cover for
a known liability of uncertain timing or amount. This includes allowances for
doubtful or bad debts.
− interest owed (e.g. negative interest charged to the beneficiary’s bank account )
− currency exchange losses (i.e. for beneficiaries using currencies other than euros
or being invoiced in a currency other than the currency they use: any loss due to
exchange rate fluctuations, e.g. between the date of invoicing and the date of
payment)
− bank costs charged by the beneficiary’s bank for transfers from the granting
authority
Conversely, bank charges for the distribution of the EU funding from the
coordinator to the beneficiaries may constitute an eligible cost for the
coordinator (if the eligibility conditions of Article 6.1 and Article 6.2.C.3 are
met).
− excessive or reckless expenditure
142EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
‘Excessive’ means paying significantly more for products, services or personnel
than the prevailing market rates or the usual practices of the beneficiary (and
thus resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action).
‘Reckless’ means failing to exercise care in the selection of products, services or
personnel (and thus resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action).
− ineligible VAT (deductible or refundable VAT, including VAT paid by public bodies
acting as public authority)
The detailed provisions regarding the eligibility of VAT under the Financial
Regulation 2024/2509 are as follows:
VAT is eligible where it is not recoverable under the applicable national VAT
legislation AND is paid by a beneficiary other than a non-taxable person within
the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 13(1) of Directive 2006/11221
(see Article 189(4)(c) FR22).
VAT is considered ‘not recoverable’ within the meaning of Article 189(4) FR if it
is not deductible or refundable under the applicable national VAT legislation.
This is, in particular, the case if according to national law it is attributable to any
of the following activities:
− (i) exempt activities without right of deduction
− (ii) activities which fall outside the scope of VAT
− (iii) activities, as referred to in point (i) or (ii), in respect of which
VAT is not deductible but refunded by means of specific refund
schemes or compensation funds not referred to in Directive
2006/112, even if that scheme or fund is established by national VAT
legislation.
‘Non-taxable persons’ are inter alia public bodies (i.e. states, regional and local
government authorities and other bodies governed by public law) in respect of
activities or transactions in which they engage as public authorities (see Article
13(1) Directive 2006/112). However, Article 189(4) FR clarifies that, for the
purposes of eligibility of costs for EU funding, VAT relating to the activities listed
in Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112 must be regarded as paid by a ‘beneficiary
other than a non-taxable person’, regardless of whether those activities are
regarded by the Member State concerned as activities engaged in by bodies
governed by public law acting as public authorities. Thus, ‘VAT paid by public
bodies acting as public authority’ (meaning any VAT, whether
deductible/refundable or not) is ineligible for public bodies acting as public
authority. However, this does not include VAT relating to the activities listed in
Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112 which can be eligible provided they are not
deductible or refundable.
The general idea is therefore that in principle only VAT that is a genuine and
definitive cost should normally be charged to the EU actions (— however subject
to the boundaries and exceptions set out above).

11.12.2006, p. 1).
22 [old Financial Regulation: Article 186(4)(c) FR 2018/1046].
143EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best practice: Ideally, VAT amounts (both if eligible and not) should be clearly
identifiable in the accounting records.
Thus, the cost and revenue accounts should exclude deductible and refundable
VAT; such VAT should be recorded in separate payable or receivable accounts,
without effect on revenue or cost line items.
VAT paid is a claim against the tax authority. It should be recorded in the
‘assets’ part of the balance sheet. It should not be recorded as expenditure in
the profit and loss accounts (only the purchase price of goods and services
excluding VAT should be recorded). Similarly, for the value of purchased
equipment or assets, only the net purchase cost should be recorded in the
balance sheet’s fixed asset line, and the depreciation cost should be calculated
based on this value, excluding VAT.
VAT collected is a debt towards the tax authority and should therefore be
recorded in the ‘liabilities’ part of the balance sheet.
If applicable (most programmes; except CEF, EUAF, CCEI, UCPM), VAT that
does NOT fall under the above kinds of ineligible VAT can be eligible and
charged under the category of cost to which it relates.
− costs incurred during the suspension of the implementation of the action
Example: Action is suspended and one of the beneficiaries continues working on it after
the date of the suspension
− in-kind contributions for free (these are not a cost for the beneficiary; except in
HE where they can be charged as eligible costs; see Article 6.1)
− costs declared under another EU grant (i.e. double funding), except for
‘Synergies actions’ or operating grants
This includes:
− costs funded directly by other EU programmes managed by the European
Commission or EU executive agencies
− costs managed/funded/awarded by Member States but co-funded from
the EU budget (e.g. Structural Funds, RRF, etc)
− costs for grants awarded/funded/managed by other EU, international or
national bodies and co-funded with EU funds (e.g. joint undertakings,
Article 185 TFEU bodies)
− costs or contributions for staff of a national (or regional/local) administration, for
activities that are part of the administration’s normal activities (i.e. not
undertaken only because of the grant) cannot be charged to the project.
However, if additional otherwise normal activities are implemented directly and
specifically for the project, such cost can be declared, even if they are the same
kind of activities as the administration’s normal tasks. These must be activities
that are implemented due to the action and either additional in quality (different
in nature or conditions) or quantity (more than usual), to the normal operations
of the national (or regional/local) administration.
Example: Giving a fine for speed excess may be considered as a normal activity of
the police, but if this is done in a specific place for a specific time due to the
implementation of a LIFE project testing new speed limits to improve air quality, they
are different in quality and/or quantity to what the police would have done otherwise
and therefore directly and specifically implemented for the action.
144EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− costs or contributions (especially travel and subsistence) for staff or
representatives of EU institutions, bodies or agencies
− for restricted calls due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security
reasons (HE, DEP, EDF and CEF-DIG): costs or contributions for activities that do
not take place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions — unless approved by the granting authority
− cost declared specifically ineligible in the call conditions.
2. Declaration of ineligible costs or contributions
If a participant declares ineligible costs or contributions in a financial statement, they will be
rejected by the granting authority (see Article 27).
Specific cases (ineligible costs):
Partially deductible VAT — Some entities have a mixed VAT regime, meaning that they
carry out VAT exempt or out-of-the-scope activities AND VAT taxed activities. When VAT paid
on goods or services by these entities cannot be directly allocated to one or the other
category of activities, it will be partially deductible. Therefore it will also be partially eligible.
The eligible part corresponds to the pro-rata of the VAT which is not deductible for that
entity.
In these cases, the beneficiary uses a provisional (estimated) deduction ratio during the year.
The final ratio is only determined at the end of the financial year. The beneficiary must
regularise VAT when closing its accounts. Therefore, the beneficiary must also regularize the
VAT costs declared for the grant (by declaring, in the next reporting period, an adjustment
for the difference between the provisional deduction ratio and the final ratio).
VAT incurred in non-EU countries — VAT which cannot be refunded in third countries may
be considered eligible under certain conditions. The beneficiaries must be able to show that
their request for exemption has been rejected by the competent authorities or the applicable
legislation which stipulate that VAT cannot be refunded.
If a beneficiary receives a VAT refund after the receipt of the final payment, it needs to
inform the granting authority which may recover amounts unduly paid.
Non-identifiable VAT in foreign invoices — In exceptional cases where the beneficiary
cannot identify the VAT charged by the supplier (e.g. small non-EU invoices), the full
purchase price can be recorded in the accounts if it is not possible to deduct/refund the VAT.
That VAT would therefore be eligible.
Duties — The eligibility of duties depends on the eligibility of the cost item to which they are
linked (i.e. in whose price they are included). If the item is eligible, the duty is also eligible.
Combining EU Synergy actions — Different EU grants can be combined if the combined
actual funding rate over all eligible costs of the project does not go above 100% AND the
grant is flagged as ‘Synergy action’ (see Data Sheet, Point 1). If the synergy is not already
coordinated by the granting authorities from the outset (as a ‘Synergy call’, i.e. coordinated
call by both granting authorities with combined fixed funding rates that do not go above
100%; see also Article 3), the beneficiaries need to inform the granting authorities if they
apply for and receive more than one source of EU funding for the action. To prevent double
funding and subsequent cost rejections and recoveries, the granting authorities will assess
adaptations of the action(s) on a case-by-case basis (this may include partitioning of the
action, rejection/reduction of eligible cost, etc).
Best practice: If you notice that your grant is not flagged as ‘Synergy action’ although it
should be, contact the granting authority to see if it is possible to make an amendment.
145EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Combining EU actions with the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) actions —
Except in very exceptional circumstances (see below) EU grants can NOT be combined with
RRF actions because the funding model of the RRF (which finances milestones and targets
without direct connection to individual project costs) makes it normally not possible to
combine RRF funding with other EU funding for the same set of activities (and costs). If the
same project should nonetheless receive funding from an EU programme and the RRF, the
project must be designed as separate actions, clearly delineated and separated for each part
(without overlaps of activities (and costs)).
In exceptional cases where it is established that an ex-ante cost delineation is not feasible or
excessively burdensome, the granting authority may agree to allow combining support from
the RRF and other directly managed programmes on a pro-rata basis (i.e. combined support
for the same project) as a last resort under certain strict conditions.23 One of these conditions
is that the combined support (i.e. grant from the directly managed programme + RRF Grant)
does not exceed the eligible costs under the directly managed programme.
This implies that the EU granting authority will need to check and verify at the level of the
beneficiary how much RRF funding the project received and lower the amount of the EU grant
(by either lowering the requested grant amount or rejecting costs) where the combined RRF
support and directly managed EU grant exceed 100% of the eligible costs under the EU
managed grant. Where the support from the directly managed programme takes the form of
a lump sum, the eligible costs will be assumed to be those that were accepted during grant
preparation and which were used as the basis for defining the lump sum amount in the EU
grant agreement.
Combining of EU action and operating grants — EU action grants can be combined with
EU operating grants if the beneficiaries are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that the
operating grant does not cover any costs which are already covered by the action grants, in
particular indirect costs already covered by the action grant). If cost separation cannot be
demonstrated, beneficiaries can still keep both grants, but must renounce to the flat-rate on
indirect cost in the action grant (since the indirect cost are already considered to be covered
by the operating grant). For detailed conditions, see Article 6.2.E.
Example: Operating grants are grants awarded to support the running costs of certain institutions
pursuing an aim of European interest, such as: College of Europe, European standards bodies
(CEN, CENELEC, ETSI).

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES
AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS
General > Article 7 — Beneficiaries
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting authority for
implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance with all the
obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action under their own
responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated entities or other participants (see
Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the beneficiaries fails to
implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure that this part is implemented by
someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the maximum grant amount and subject to an
amendment; see Article 39). The financial responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed
by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding the grant for the
entire duration of the action. Costs and contributions will be eligible only as long as the beneficiary and the
action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any events or
circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the implementation of the action (see
Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the pre-financing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if
required; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article 21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority under the
Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their affiliated
entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and the granting
authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies otherwise, and in
particular:
147EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- submit the pre-financing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify their quality
and completeness before passing them on to the granting authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other beneficiaries
(report on the distribution of payments; if required, see Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other beneficiaries
without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary or third
party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii) last indent and
(iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have created or which are controlled by or
affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance
with the obligations under the Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’33 (or similar, such as European research infrastructure
consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to one of their members. The
coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-ordination, to ensure that
the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written
consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of recoveries (if
any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article 16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION for programmes with linked actions: [OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked actions, the
beneficiaries must have arrangements with the participants of the other action, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set out in a written
collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the consortium is the same, as part of
their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
33 For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy the criteria for being awarded a
grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the
purpose of implementing the action financed by the grant.”
148EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of outputs,
common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy activities, common
communication and dissemination activities, sharing of information, access to background and
results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in both actions.
The arrangements with the participants of the other action must not contain any provision contrary to this
Agreement.] ]
1. Division of roles and responsibilities — Responsibilities towards the granting
authority — Technical and financial responsibility for the action
The beneficiaries are formal parties to the Grant Agreement (they sign the Grant Agreement
or Accession Forms). They have direct contractual obligations under the Grant Agreement
and are fully responsible for implementing the action properly (see Article 11).
This means that:
− each beneficiary must ensure that it complies with its obligations under the Grant
Agreement
− each beneficiary must ensure swift and proper implementation of the action (i.e. that
there are no delays and that the work is done properly)
− each beneficiary is responsible (towards the granting authority) for the tasks
performed by its subcontractors, affiliated entities and associated partners
− the granting authority is NOT responsible for the implementation of the action and has
NO responsibility for the way in which the action is conducted (or any adverse
consequences).
The beneficiaries are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. This
means that they (and any new beneficiaries added later on during the project through an
amendment) accept that they are together responsible for fully implementing the whole
project.
If one of the beneficiaries leaves the action (irrespective of the reason), the remaining
partners must carry out the action as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1)
— including the part of the defaulting beneficiary. They will have to do this without any
additional funding. The Grant Agreement will have to be amended, in order to redistribute the
tasks, terminate the beneficiary’s participation, and/or add a new beneficiary (see Article 39).
Example: Beneficiaries A, B and C have signed a Grant Agreement with a duration of three years
with the Commission in order to carry out an action. One year later, beneficiary C goes bankrupt.
Beneficiaries A and B remain fully responsible to implement the whole action, including the tasks
of C. A and B must agree that one (or both) take over the part of beneficiary C (or ensure
replacement by adding a new beneficiary), to make sure that the entire action is implemented as
described in Annex 1.
From a financial point of view, each participant is in principle responsible for the proper and
sound financial management of their part of the grant. In case of recoveries, there may
however, depending on the programme and Grant Agreement, be certain situations where
beneficiaries may be held responsible for their partners (financial liability):
149EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): the financial liability is as
follows:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation, but not intervene to recover this money (no debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole
amount that needs to be recovered (i.e. paid back to the granting authority)—
even if it has not been the final recipient of the concerned amount (debit note);
if the coordinator does not pay (irrespective of the reason), the granting
authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, drawing on the pre-
financing guarantee, joint and several liability of other beneficiaries or affiliated
entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see Article 22.4)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): each beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle
limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by their affiliated
entities. It is only for the contribution to the MIM that financial responsibility is
shared:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation and, if the beneficiary doesn’t pay, the granting authority may call
on the MIM to intervene and then start a recovery procedure against the
beneficiary for the account of the MIM (debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the contribution to the MIM will be used to
cover recoveries (if any); if the contribution is not sufficient, the coordinator
will be asked to pay back the amount owed (as representative of the
consortium); if the debt is not paid but the report on the distribution of
payments was provided, the granting authority will calculate the share of the
debt per beneficiary and confirm the amount to be recovered from each of
them separately (debit note); if they do not pay (irrespective of the reason),
the granting authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, joint and
several liability of affiliated entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see
Article 22.4); if the report on the distribution of payments was NOT provided,
the granting authority will enforce recovery against the coordinator (debit
note); if needed, the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and
will then continue recovery for the account of the MIM (second debit note
replacing the first)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note); no MIM intervention (new for 2021-
2027).
Beneficiaries are always liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities (see Article
22.2).
2. Division of roles and responsibilities — Roles and responsibilities within the
consortium
The general division of roles and responsibilities within the consortium is as follows:
− the coordinator must coordinate and manage the grant and is the central contact point
for the granting authority
150EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the beneficiaries and other participants must all together contribute to a smooth and
successful implementation of the grant (i.e. contribute to the proper implementation
of the action, comply with their own obligations under the Grant Agreement and
support the coordinator in his obligations).
All communication with the granting authority should in principle go through the coordinator.
Documents/information should be submitted via the coordinator — unless, for specific cases,
the granting authority requests individual partners to provide such information directly (e.g.
in case of an audit, the beneficiaries must submit the documents requested directly to the
auditors, see Article 25).
Other participants (i.e. affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors, etc) may be
part of the consortium, if this is considered useful by the beneficiaries. It is generally
recommended to involve all entities that are important for the successful implementation of
the project, independently of their formal role in the grant.
3. The coordinator’s roles and responsibilities
The coordinator is the central contact point for the granting authority and represents the
consortium (towards the granting authority).
For this purpose, the Grant Agreement imposes a number of specific coordination tasks.
Coordination tasks:
▪ Monitor that the action is implemented properly
▪ Act as the intermediary for all communications — unless the Grant Agreement
specifies otherwise
▪ Request and review documents or information required by the granting authority
and verify their completeness and correctness
▪ Submit the deliverables and reports in the system
▪ Submit the pre-financing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
▪ Distribute payments to the other beneficiaries, without unjustified delay
▪ Inform the granting authority of the amounts paid to each beneficiary, if requested
to do so (see Articles 22 and 32)
The coordination tasks include quality-checking of documents/information submitted by the
beneficiaries, in particular:
− reviewing the individual financial statements from each beneficiary to verify
consistency with the action tasks, as well as completeness and correctness
− verifying that all the requested documents/information have been provided by the
beneficiary (e.g. the use of resources, etc)
− verifying that the beneficiary submits the documents/information in the requested
format
− verifying that the technical information submitted by a beneficiary concerns its action
tasks as described in Annex 1 (and not something unrelated to the action).
The coordinator is not, however, obliged to verify the eligibility of the costs declared, nor to
request justifications. Each beneficiary/affiliated entity remains responsible for the cost it
declares (both as regards eligibility and as regards sufficient records and supporting
documents to substantiate them).
151EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The coordination tasks listed above can NOT be subcontracted or outsourced to another
entity including other beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, or associated partners.
They can only be delegated, under certain circumstances, to entities with ‘authorisation to
administer’ or in the case of ‘sole beneficiaries’ within the meaning of Article 190(2) of the
Financial Regulation 2024/250924 (see below).
By contrast, the coordinator remains free — like any other beneficiary — to use affiliated
entities or subcontractors for other tasks; see Articles 8 and 9.3).
Specific cases (coordinator responsibilities):
‘Entities with authorisation to administer’ — Coordinators that are public bodies may
exceptionally delegate coordination tasks (e.g. the administration of the payments) to
another entity, if this is their usual practice (e.g. a foundation).
For the handling of such coordinator tasks, this other entity must fulfil the following
conditions:
− it must participate as an affiliated entity of the coordinator
and
− it must have been granted an ‘authorisation to administer’ in order to handle the
coordinator’s administrative affairs (and those must include receiving and
administering EU funds).
In this case, the bank account number to be provided by the coordinator during grant
preparation must be that of the entity with the authorisation to administer. The payments will
then be transferred directly to it and it will have to distribute them for the coordinator.
Since they participate as affiliated entity, the entity must be registered in the Participant
Register (have a PIC) and be validated by the Central Validation Service.
The coordinator will remain fully responsible for the entity under the Grant Agreement. For
detailed guidance, see the specific cases in Article 8.
‘Sole beneficiaries’ (or similar, e.g. ERICs25) — Entities which form one joint entity for the
purpose of implementing the action and all comply with the eligibility criteria can participate
as ‘sole beneficiaries’ in EU actions (see Article 190(2) FR 2024/250926). Coordinators which
are sole beneficiaries (or similar, e.g. European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERICs))
and do not have their own resources may exceptionally delegate the coordination tasks to
one of their members. Coordinators using one of their members remain fully responsible for
them under the Grant Agreement.
Technical/scientific coordination (or similar) — The coordinator within the meaning of
the Grant Agreement is the beneficiary in charge of the (administrative) coordination tasks
set out in this Article. Other kinds of coordination activities, i.e. tasks not listed in this Article
(e.g. of technical or scientific nature) can be carried out by any other participant.
These participants may internally (i.e. within the consortium) be called, for example,
‘technical’ or ‘scientific coordinator’, but they will NOT be considered coordinator in the
meaning of the Grant Agreement and are not subject to the rules in Article 7.
24 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(2) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
25 Council Regulation (EC) No 723/2009 of 25 June 2009 on the Community legal framework for a European
Research Infrastructure Consortium (OJ L 206, 08.08.2009, p.1).
26 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(2) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
152EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Costs for this type of technical/scientific coordination are eligible, if they comply with the
eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.
4. Internal arrangements between beneficiaries — Consortium agreement
The participants should (mandatory for multi-beneficiary grants, if required in the Data
Sheet) conclude a consortium agreement to ensure a smooth and successful action
implementation.
The ‘consortium agreement’ is an agreement between members of the consortium, to set out
their internal arrangements for implementing the project and the administration of the EU
grant. It is purely internal; it should NOT be submitted to the granting authority for
information or review; the granting authority is NOT party and has NO responsibility for it
(nor for any adverse consequences).
Best practice: In view of their importance for avoiding disputes and ensuring a smooth
implementation of the grant, we strongly recommend that every consortium sets up a
consortium agreement, even if not mandatory in the Data Sheet. In any case, the
beneficiaries need to put in place all necessary arrangements regarding their operation and
co-ordination to ensure the proper implementation of the action.
The consortium agreement should complement the Grant Agreement and must NOT contain
any provision contrary to it (or the applicable EU, international or national law).
It should in principle be negotiated and concluded before grant signature (i.e. each
beneficiary should sign the consortium agreement before signing the Accession Form to
accede to the Grant Agreement). Otherwise, there is usually a serious risk that prolonged
disagreement jeopardises the action. Of course, the consortium agreement does not have to
remain the same during the lifetime of the action, it can be modified by the consortium at
any moment.
The duration should at least cover the time until the final payment, however, a longer or
open-ended duration, where relevant, should be considered in order to fully cover any issues
that may emerge after the final payment, such as exploitation of the results (e.g. licensing),
issues arising from audits, etc.
The agreement must be in writing. It may be a simple written agreement or take some other
form (e.g. a notarial deed or part of the statutes of a separate legal entity, such as a
European Economic Interest Grouping, association or joint venture).
For guidance on consortium agreements, see How to draw up your consortium agreement. This
document has been developed for H2020 actions (MFF 2014-2020), but it can also serve for
inspiration in other EU programmes and for the new MFF 2021-2027. In case of questions, please
contact the granting authority.
5. Relationship with beneficiaries of linked actions — Collaboration agreement
The participants of linked actions must make arrangements to determine and coordinate
implementation in the areas where close collaboration is needed and should conclude a
collaboration agreement (mandatory if required in the Data Sheet), to ensure that linked
actions are implemented and coordinated properly.
‘Collaboration agreement’ are agreements between the participants of linked actions to
coordinate their work. The granting authority is not party and has NO responsibility for them
(nor for any adverse consequences). If the consortium in the linked actions is the same, the
collaboration agreement may be included as part of the consortium agreement.
The collaboration agreement should complement the Grant Agreement and must NOT contain
any provision contrary to it (or the applicable EU, international or national law).
153EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
It should set out the details on the collaboration and synchronisation of the activities as well
as on the internal organisation and decision processes of the linked actions. If considered
useful, it can also foresee common boards and advisory structures. These will complement
the governance of each of the linked actions; they can NOT replace the consortium and other
project governance mechanisms that are required for the EU action (if applicable).
For guidance on collaboration agreements, see How to draw up your collaboration agreement.
This document has been developed for H2020 actions (MFF 2014-2020), but it can also serve for
inspiration in other EU programmes and for the new MFF 2021-2027. In case of questions, please
contact the granting authority.

General > Article 8 — Affiliated entities
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
ARTICLE 8 — AFFILIATED ENTITIES
[OPTION 1 for programmes without affiliated entities: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with affiliated entities (standard): [OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The
following entities which are linked to a beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘affiliated entities’:
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short name)]
- [AE legal name (short name)], PIC [number], linked to [BEN legal name (short name)]
[same for more AE]
Affiliated entities can charge costs and contributions to the action under the same conditions as the
beneficiaries and must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in accordance with Article
11.
Their costs and contributions will be included in Annex 2 and will be taken into account for the calculation of
the grant.
The beneficiaries must ensure that all their obligations under this Agreement also apply to their affiliated
entities.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the affiliated entities.
Breaches by affiliated entities will be handled in the same manner as breaches by beneficiaries. Recovery of
undue amounts will be handled through the beneficiaries.
If the granting authority requires joint and several liability of affiliated entities (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4),
they must sign the declaration set out in Annex 3a and may be held liable in case of enforced recoveries
against their beneficiaries (see Article 22.2 and 22.4).]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable] ]
1. Affiliated entities
Affiliated entities (in some programmes formerly called ‘linked third parties’; new for 2021-
2027) are entities with a (usually legal or capital) link to a beneficiary and which implement
parts of the action and are allowed to charge costs directly to the grant.
They do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA) but can be part of
the consortium and often play an important role in implementing the action. Therefore, the
Grant Agreement mentions them by name and defines their role (rights and obligations).
In practice, they are treated in many ways like beneficiaries (have their own financial
statement, must provide their own CFS, must contribute to the technical report, must submit
deliverables, etc).
Annotations in this AGA which refer to beneficiaries usually also apply to
affiliated entities (just like the provisions of the MGA themselves; see also MGA
Preamble).
For technical and security reasons, affiliated entities do NOT however have direct
access to the Portal My Area section (see Article 36). They therefore always need to go
through their beneficiaries (to sign the declaration of honour, submit financial statements,
contribute to the technical report, etc).
155EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Characteristics of implementation by affiliated entities:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1 (including the
handling of subcontracting, financial support to third parties (FSTP), etc).
▪ They do not charge a ‘price’, but declare their own costs.
▪ The work is and is usually carried out on their premises, under their full and direct
control, instructions and management, with their own employees.
▪ The beneficiary remains responsible towards the granting authority for the work
carried out by its affiliated entities and for the recovery of undue payments from
its affiliated entities (if any).
‘Link to the beneficiaries’ means in particular a legal or capital link, which is neither limited to
the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation (see Article 190(1)(b)
FR 2024/250927). This covers:
− permanent legal structures (e.g. the relationship between an association and its
members)
− contractual cooperation not limited to the action (e.g. an existing collaboration
agreement for activities in a field relevant to the action;)
− capital link, i.e.
− direct or indirect control of the beneficiary
− under the same direct or indirect control as the beneficiary
or
− directly or indirectly controlling the beneficiary.
Moreover, it covers not only the case of parent companies or holdings and their daughter
companies or subsidiaries and vice-versa, but also the case of affiliates between themselves
(e.g. entities controlled by the same entity).
Examples:
1. Company A established in France holding 20% of the shares in Company B established in Italy.
However, with 20% of the shares, it has 60% of the voting rights in company B. Therefore,
company A controls company B and both companies may be affiliated entities.
2. Company X and company Y do not control each other, but they are both owned by company Z.
They are both considered affiliated entities.
3. The Ministry A is in accordance with national law the supervisory authority of a national agency.
They can be considered as affiliated entities. Conversely, if the national agency is by statute set up
as independent from the central government, the agency and the Ministry should instead
participate as separate beneficiaries (or other fitting roles).
4. Associations, foundations or other legal entities composed of members — That entity is generally
the beneficiary and the members are the affiliated entities.
5. Joint Research Units (JRU) (i.e. research laboratories/infrastructures created and owned by two
or more different legal entities in order to carry out research) — They do not have a separate legal
personality, but form a single research unit where staff and resources from the different members
are put together to the benefit of all. Though lacking legal personality, they exist physically, with
27 [old Financial Regulation: Article 187(1)(b) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
156EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
premises, equipment, and resources that belong to them. A member of the JRU can be the
beneficiary and other members can participate as affiliated entities. The JRU has to meet all the
following conditions:
− scientific and economic unity
− last a certain length of time
− recognised by a public authority.
It is necessary that the JRU itself is recognised by a public authority, i.e. an entity identified as
such under the applicable national law. The beneficiary must provide to the granting authority, a
copy of the resolution, law, decree, decision, attesting the relationship between the beneficiary and
the affiliated entity(ies), or a copy of the document establishing the joint research unit, or any
other document that proves that research facilities are put in a common structure and correspond
to the concept of scientific and economic unit.
Just like beneficiaries, affiliated entities must normally fulfil the conditions for participation
and funding.
Example: Company A established in Germany is a beneficiary in a grant. A owns B, a French
company and also owns C, a company established in a non-EU country not associated to the
programme. B and C may be considered affiliates to A, however only B may participate as
affiliated entity to A, because company C is established in a non-associated third country and is
therefore not eligible. C can instead participate as an associated partner.
Affiliated entities must be listed in Article 8, their tasks must be mentioned in Annex 1 and
their budget in Annex 2.There is NO simplified approval procedure.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the action tasks done by
affiliated entities (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that the affiliated entities comply with the same obligations as
they themselves (mutatis mutandis).
Obligations that must be extended to affiliated entities:
▪ all obligations (mutatis mutandis)
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
affiliated entities.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the affiliated
entities, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the affiliated
entities, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (affiliated entities):
Joint and several liability of affiliated entities — The granting authority may (during
grant preparation) require joint and several liability of an affiliated entity, if:
− the financial capacity of a beneficiary is ‘weak’ and
− the beneficiary mainly coordinates the work of its affiliated entity.
Examples:
1. The financially weak beneficiary is an association and most of the work is carried out by several
of its members as affiliated entities.
2. The financially weak beneficiary is a small company with a substantial part of its work
implemented by a bigger affiliated entity.
3. The proposal submitted by four independent entities established in four Member States is
positively evaluated. The four successful applicants decide to form a legal entity to simplify the
management of the project. The newly established entity will be the beneficiary, i.e. a new legal
entity. The successful applicants will carry out the work as affiliated entities of the new legal entity.
157EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If requested, the affiliated entity must accept joint and several liability with their beneficiary.
In this case, it must sign a declaration (on paper and in blue-ink, using the Annex 3a
generated by the system) to be submitted by the beneficiary at the moment of its accession
to the grant (or amendment adding the affiliated entity). The affiliated entity must send the
original to the beneficiary (by registered post with proof of delivery), who must upload it (as
a scanned PDF copy) in the system.
The liability is for any amount owned by the beneficiary under the Grant Agreement, and up
to the affiliated entity’s maximum EU contribution in Annex 2.
More details on the financial capacity check are available in the Online Manual > Participant
Register > Financial capacity assessment on the Portal.
Entities created in order to manage administrative/financial tasks (including
‘entities with authorisation to administer’) — These are typically legal entities
(foundations, spin-off companies, etc), created or controlled by a beneficiary (usually a public
body like a university/ministry) to handle the financial and administrative aspects of the
beneficiaries’ involvement e.g. in EU actions.
If they handle coordinator tasks (see Article 7) or implement action tasks themselves, they
have to participate as affiliated entity of the beneficiary/coordinator and have to declare their
own costs.
Resources they put at the disposal of their beneficiary for the action implementation should in
principle also be charged by them as affiliated entity.
However, for HE, in case different funding rates are applied for the beneficiary versus the
affiliated entity, the costs can also be declared by the beneficiary:
− if the resources are provided against payment: in accordance with rules of the
appropriate cost category (e.g. Article 6.2.A.3 for personnel put at the disposal of the
beneficiary; Article 6.2.C.2 for equipment or Article 6.2.C.3 for other goods, works and
services)
− if the resources are provided for free: in accordance with the rules on eligibility of in-
kind contributions (see Article 6.1).
Best practice: It is recommended to describe in the DoA Annex 1 the relation between the
beneficiary and the foundation/spin-off and its impact on the Grant Agreement.

ARTICLE 9 — OTHER PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN THE ACTION
9.1 Associated partners
[OPTION 1 for programmes without associated partners: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with associated partners (standard): [OPTION 1 if selected for the grant: The
following entities which cooperate with a beneficiary will participate in the action as ‘associated partners’:
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number] [associated partner of [BEN legal name (short
name)]]
- [AP legal name (short name)], PIC [number] [associated partner of [BEN legal name (short
name)]]
[same for more AP]
Associated partners must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in accordance with Article
11. They may not charge costs or contributions to the action and the costs for their tasks are not eligible.
The tasks must be set out in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their contractual obligations under Articles 11 (proper implementation),
12 (conflict of interests), 13 (confidentiality and security), 14 (ethics), 17.2 (visibility), 18 (specific rules for
carrying out action), 19 (information) and 20 (record-keeping) also apply to the associated partners.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the associated partners.]
[OPTION 2: Not applicable] ]
1. Associated partners
Associated partners are entities that implement action tasks, but without receiving EU
funding.
They do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign an accession form), but they
implement parts of the action and are thus often involved actively in the consortium.
Therefore, the Grant Agreement mentions them by name and defines their role (rights and
obligations).
Characteristics of implementation by associated partners:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ They participate at own costs (do not receive EU funding).
▪ The consortium (or, in case the associated partner cooperates with a specific
beneficiary as named in Article 9.1, that beneficiary) remains responsible towards
the granting authority for the work performed by the associated partners.
Associated partners do NOT need to have a (capital or legal) link to any beneficiary (but they
may have one).
159EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Since they do not receive EU funding, associated partners do NOT have to comply with the
eligibility conditions (but they may)).
Associated partners must be listed in Article 9.1, their tasks must be mentioned in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the tasks implemented by
associated partners (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations:
Obligations that must be extended to associated partners:
▪ Proper implementation (see Article 11), including compliance with call conditions
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific9 rules for the action implementation (see Article 18), including
compliance with specific rules set out in Annex 5
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
associated partners (e.g. via contractual arrangements, consortium agreement, etc).
The beneficiaries must also ensure that the associated partners respect the call conditions
and Annex 5.
Example: In Horizon Europe, the Grant Agreement provides for additional obligations in Annex 5
regarding results, e.g. open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications which applies to all such
publications under the Grant Agreement, including publications where associated partners are
involved.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
associated partners, particular concerning the action implementation.

General > Article 9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions
9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions
9.2 Third parties giving in-kind contributions
[OPTION 1 for programmes with in-kind contributions allowed but not eligible (standard):
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods,
works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge), if necessary for the implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not charge costs or
contributions to the action and the costs for the in-kind contributions are not eligible.
The third parties and their in-kind contributions should be set out in Annex 1.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with in-kind contributions eligible:
Other third parties may give in-kind contributions to the action (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods,
works and services, etc. which are free-of-charge) if necessary for the implementation.
Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not implement any action tasks. They may not charge costs or
contributions to the action, but the costs for the in-kind contributions are eligible and may be charged by the
beneficiaries which use them, under the conditions set out in Article 6. The costs will be included in Annex 2
as part of the beneficiaries’ costs.
The third parties and their in-kind contributions should be set out in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the third parties giving in-kind contributions. ]
[OPTION 3 for programmes with in-kind contributions not allowed:
In-kind contributions (i.e. personnel, equipment, other goods and services, etc. given by third parties free-of-
charge) are not allowed for the implementation of the action.]
1. Third parties providing in-kind contributions: In-kind contributions allowed but
not eligible
This is the standard rule for most EU programmes. Beneficiaries may use in-kind
contributions provided by third parties, if necessary to implement the action, but they are not
counted towards the project budget (not eligible costs).
Examples (in-kind contributions allowed but not eligible):
1. Civil servant working as a professor in a public university is also working on the action. His salary
is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but by the government (the ministry). It can therefore
not be charged to the EU grant.
2. A entity providing learning spaces for free to the beneficiaries, for example a municipality for an
NGO part of the project.
3. A graphic company providing for free the design of booklets.
In-kind contributions refers only to the case where a third party makes available some
of its resources to a beneficiary for free (i.e. without any payment; new for 2021-2027). In
this case, the beneficiary itself makes no payment and there is therefore NO cost incurred by
the beneficiary. There are therefore normally NO costs that can be charged to the action (—
unless specifically provided for in the Programme Regulation, e.g. for HE).
By contrast, if there is any payment by the beneficiary to the third party for the in-kind
contribution provided, the beneficiary can declare the costs in the appropriate cost category:
− personnel costs for seconded persons (see Article 6.2.A.3)
− renting costs for equipment (see Article 6.2.C.2) or
− purchase costs for other goods, works and services (see Article 6.2.C.3).
161EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Third parties providing in-kind contributions: In-kind contributions eligible
For some EU programmes (only HE), the Programme Regulation (basic act) allows in-kind
contribution costs to be charged to the action.
Examples (in-kind contributions eligible): Civil servant working as a professor in a public
university is also working on the action. His salary is paid not by the beneficiary (the university) but
by the government (the ministry). In Horizon Europe, the beneficiary may charge these costs to the
grant, even if they are incurred by a third party (the ministry/government).
The eligibility conditions for such costs are set out in Article 6.1. However, in kind
contributions against payment ARE NOT a budget category: Depending on the type of cost,
they must be declared in, and comply with, the fitting budget category (e.g. personnel costs,
equipment).
In-kind contributions and the third parties contributing them must be mentioned in Annex 1
(simplified approval procedure; see below).
Moreover, if in-kind contributions are charged to the action, the beneficiaries must also
ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, the European Court
of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks,
reviews, audits and investigations on the third parties, and in particular to audit their costs. If
access is denied by the third party, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (in-kind contributions eligible):
Simplified approval procedure (new in-kind contributions) — For programmes where
in-kind contributions are eligible (only HE), if the need for an in-kind contribution was not
known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to introduce
the new contribution into the Annex 1 (see Article 39) or flag it in the periodic report
(simplified approval procedure; for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the
beneficiaries bear however the risk that the granting authority might not approve the new
contribution and reject the costs at interim or final payment-stage later on.

carrying out action), 19 (information) and 20 (record-keeping) also apply to the subcontractors.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court
of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the subcontractors. ]
1. Subcontractors
Subcontractors do not become party to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA), but they
often implement important parts of the action (i.e. action tasks specified in Annex 1) and
thus may need to be involved actively in the consortium. Therefore, the Grant Agreement
mentions them and defines their role (rights and obligations).
Characteristics of subcontractors:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They perform action tasks attributed to them in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ charges a price, which usually includes a profit (— this distinguishes it from
affiliated entities; see Article 8), to be declared as subcontracting costs by a
beneficiary.
▪ The work is carried out without the direct supervision of the beneficiary and is not
hierarchically subordinate to the beneficiary (— this distinguishes it from action
tasks implemented by in-house consultants; see Article 6.2.A.2).
▪ The motivation is pecuniary, not the work on the project itself. The subcontractor
is paid by the beneficiary in exchange for its work.
▪ The beneficiary remains fully responsible towards the granting authority for action
tasks performed by its subcontractors.
Example (subcontract): A Grant Agreement for an action on nature reserves describes in
Annex 1 two action tasks. The first task concerns a comparative study of water quality in the
reserve, which the beneficiary’s employee will compile after taking and sending water samples
to laboratories. The lab work is necessary for the implementation of the action but only a
subactivity of compiling the study (the action task), therefore it will fall under purchase costs
(see Article 6.2.C). The second task concerns an aerial survey of the water bodies for which the
beneficiary does not have the necessary know-how and assets and therefore subcontracts to a
service provider who will implement the survey (the action task) through activities like aerial
photography and analysis.
163EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The action tasks to be subcontracted and the estimated costs (not necessarily the
subcontractor, especially if not known yet) must be identified and justified in Annex 1 (Article
6.2.B; simplified approval procedure; see below).
Normally you are NOT obliged to give information about the names of the subcontractors
selected (in DoA Annex 1 or periodic report), but many programmes require this information
indirectly through the detailed budget/cost reporting table.
Best practice: If you think that there is an issue with a subcontractor that might impact the
eligibility of subcontracting costs (e.g. potential conflict of interest; subcontractor not in
compliance with the call conditions or subject to sanctions, etc), inform the granting
authority and ask for specific guidance.
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper implementation of the subcontracted action
tasks by the subcontractors (proper quality, timely delivery, etc).
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations:
Obligations that must be extended to subcontractors:
▪ Proper implementation (see Article 11), including compliance with call conditions
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18), including
compliance with specific rules set out in Annex 5
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
subcontractors (e.g. via contractual arrangements, consortium agreement, etc).
The beneficiaries must also ensure that the subcontractors respect the the call conditions and
Annex 5.
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
subcontractors, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
subcontractor, the costs will be rejected.
Specific cases (subcontractors):
Simplified approval procedure (new subcontracts) — If the need for a subcontract was
not known at grant signature, the coordinator must request an amendment in order to
introduce the subcontracting of one or more tasks in Annex 1 (see Article 39) or, if allowed,
flag it in the periodic report (simplified approval procedure; allowed for most programmes;
for details, see Article 6.1). In the latter case, the beneficiaries bear however the risk that the
granting authority might not approve the new subcontracting of the task(s) and reject the
costs at interim or final payment-stage later on.

The beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF,
Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the recipients.]
1. Recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)
Recipients of financial support to third parties (grants, prizes or other) do not become party
to the Grant Agreement (do not sign the GA) and are not part of the consortium. They do not
implement action tasks, but they benefit from them and receive (indirectly) a part of the EU
funding. Therefore, the Grant Agreement defines their role (rights and obligations).
Characteristics of FSTP recipients:
▪ They do not sign the Grant Agreement (and are therefore not beneficiaries).
▪ They do not perform action tasks, but the financial support given to them is part of
an action task specified in the DoA Annex 1.
▪ They receive financial support from the grant (e.g. sub-grant or prize money), to
be declared as financial support to third parties cost by a beneficiary.
The beneficiaries remain responsible towards the granting authority for the proper use of the
funding by the recipients.
They must moreover ensure that they comply with certain obligations, where
relevant/applicable based on the nature of the action:
Obligations that must be extended to FSTP recipients:
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding, as appropriate (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18)
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
165EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
recipients (e.g. via cascading call conditions or contractual arrangements, scholarship
agreement, rules of contest, etc).
Moreover, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
recipients, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
recipient, the costs will be rejected.

consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. Non-EU participants
Non-EU participants are not a separate category of participants, but simply participants (e.g.
beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner, subcontractor) that are not legally
established in one of the EU Member States. They can usually participate in EU funding
programmes, if:
− their country is associated to the programme (so-called ‘associated country’) —
standard case
OR
− if the programme is open to participation and funding of entities from third countries
— rare (e.g. HE, RELEX).
Since non-EU participants are normally not subject to EU law, the Grant Agreement recalls
the most important principles and makes them contractually binding. Thus, participants
undertake to comply with all their obligations under the Grant Agreement and commit to:
− respect key principles, such as fundamental rights, EU values and ethical principles,
environmental and labour standards, security of information rules, respect for IPR
protection and privacy
− use appropriate audit standards as well as qualified and independent external auditors
− allow for checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the bodies mentioned in Article
25 (e.g. granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-
Fraud Office (OLAF))
167EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Moreover, since non-EU participants are regularly located outside the jurisdiction of the EU
courts (General Court, Court of Justice), disputes will be settled by the courts of Brussels,
Belgium (— unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU court
judgments).
Specific cases (non-EU participants):
International organisations (IOs) — International organisations do NOT fall under Article
10.1 (nor under the option for non-EU participants in the declaration of honour (DoH) to be
signed before grant signature), since they do NOT count as participants from non-EU
countries.
Formally speaking, place of establishment of international organisations is irrelevant and for
the purposes of the Grant Agreement they are considered as neither EU nor non-EU entities.
They have a special status (supra-national)and are covered specifically by the provisions of
Article 10.2.
If an international organisation is pillar-assessed, the provisions of Article 10.3 apply in
addition.

[OPTION 1 for programmes without international organisations: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with international organisations (standard): Participants which are international
organisations (IOs; if any) undertake to comply with their obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical principles,
environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information, intellectual property rights,
visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use either independent public officers or
external auditors which comply with comparable standards as those set out in EU Directive
2006/43/EC35
- for the controls under Article 25: to allow for the checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the
bodies mentioned in that Article, taking into account the specific agreements concluded by them
and the EU (if any).
For such participants, nothing in the Agreement will be interpreted as a waiver of their privileges or
immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or international law.
Special rules on applicable law and dispute settlement apply (see Article 43 and Data Sheet, Point 5).]
35 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and
consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. International organisations (IOs)
International organisations are not a separate category of participants, but simply
participants (e.g. beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner, subcontractor) with a
specific legal form and status under international public law and validated as such in the
Participant Register.
Examples: International organisations are for example UN organisations and specialised
agencies (e.g. WHO, UNHCR, UNEP, UNESCO), ESA, ECMWF, OCCAR.
They can usually participate in EU funding programmes, unless the programme explicitly
provides otherwise (e.g. in HE, international European research organisations (IEROs) can
always participate with funding, while other international organisations can participate with
funding only under certain circumstances set out in the work programme/call conditions).
Since international organisations are normally not subject to EU law, the Grant Agreement
recalls the most important principles and obligations regarding audits and controls and makes
them contractually binding.
In addition, Article 10.2 acknowledges that nothing in the Grant Agreement will be
interpreted as a waiver of the privileges and immunities set out in their constituent
documents and recognized under international law.
Thus, for instance,:
− enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU or decisions on administrative sanctions
(i.e. exclusion or financial penalties; see Articles 22 and 34) will normally not be
directed at international organisations
169EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− international organisations agree with the granting authority on the applicable law that
should apply to the Grant Agreement (including no applicable law; see Article 43.1).
− dispute settlement is normally not brought before national or EU courts but referred to
the Permanent Court of Arbitration (see Article 43.2).
Additional specific rules apply moreover if the international organisation is also pillar-
assessed (see Article 10.3).

General > Article 10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
[OPTION 1 for programmes without pillar-assessed entities: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with pillar-assessed entities: Pillar-assessed participants (if any) may rely on
their own systems, rules and procedures, in so far as they have been positively assessed and do not call into
question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and procedures which
participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control system, accounting system, external
audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and exclusion, information on recipients and protection of
personal data; see Article 157 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in
particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards, rules and
procedures
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in accordance with usual
accounting practices
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, pre-financing guarantees are not needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their regular internal
or external auditors and in accordance with their internal financial regulations and
procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if those practices
are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no recovery if
the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue amounts from the third party
receiving the support (including legal proceedings) and non-recovery is not due to an error or
negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be conducted taking into
account the rules and procedures specifically agreed between them and the framework
agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the participant’s internal
rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment will be
calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for execution only after
termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into before the pre-information letter was
received and could not reasonably be terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated for damage it
sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not
implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the damage is due to an
infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures or due to a violation of third
parties’ rights by the participant or one of its employees or individual for whom the employees
are responsible.
171EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do purchases,
subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance with their internal rules and
procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal standards, rules
and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of equal treatment of
applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use), communication,
dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- specific rules for carrying out the action (Article 18)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems, rules and
procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules and procedures
that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU, may moreover —
under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach
the principle of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries) — rely on provisions set out in that framework
agreement. ]
1. Pillar-assessed entities
Pillar-assessed entities are not a separate category of participants not a separate category of
participants, but simply participants (e.g. beneficiary, affiliated entity, associated partner)
that are also ‘pillar-assessed’.
Article 10.3 applies only to entities with a positive pillar-assessment. Entities with
ongoing pillar-assessment procedures must apply the standard rules under the Grant
Agreement until they fulfil the requirements to benefit from the special status provided for
in Article 10.3 (i.e. having a positive pillar assessment).
The special provisions in Article 10 may apply cumulatively for entities with multiple
statuses. Thus if an international organisation participates in a consortium and is also pillar-
assessed, both Article 10.2 and 10.3 will apply.
172EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The ‘pillar assessment’ is a special ex-ante assessment of the rules, systems and procedures
used for managing funds in accordance with Article 157 of the EU Financial Regulation
2024/250928. It provides the granting authority with assurance that the entity can offer a
similar level of protection of the budget as the Commission when it manages EU funds.
Since the pillar assessment ensures that the granting authority can rely on the systems, rules
and procedures of such entities, they can rely on those systems, rules and procedures also
for the grant, provided that:
− the systems, rules and procedures used have actually been positively assessed
Example: An entity has been pillar-assessed but the auditors had material findings regarding
the internal audit capacity leading to a negative internal control pillar result. In this case, the
granting authority cannot rely on the entity’s own rules in this respect and the entity cannot use
its own internal auditors to draw up the CFS for the activities under the Grant Agreement.
− the application of own systems, rules and procedures does not call into question the
decision awarding the grant and does not lead to a breach of the principle of equal
treatment.
Thus, if pillar-assessed entities apply in a call for proposals they must comply with all the call
conditions (IPR protection, security, ethics, etc) and the provisions of the Grant Agreement
(rules on electronic management and communication, reporting and monitoring, payment
arrangements, etc), even if these might not be in line with their internal practice (pillar-
assessed or not). The rules of the pillar-assessed entity can therefore only be used, if they do
not contradict the conditions set out in the call or the Grant Agreement.
Examples:
1. Financial support to third parties (FSTP): A beneficiary has been positively assessed for the
grants pillar. Normally, it could therefore rely on its own rules and procedures when giving FSTP in
the form of grants. However, if the call conditions stipulate specific criteria for the provision of
FSTP (e.g. because these are necessary to achieve the objectives of the call) then the pillar-
assessed entity has to follow the criteria provided for in the call, irrespective of its own positively-
assessed practices. The application of other rules would call into question the award decision since
the FSTP would not comply with the conditions of the call.
2. Subcontracting: A beneficiary has been positively assessed for the procurement pillar.
Normally, it could therefore rely on its own rules and procedures for e.g. subcontracting. However,
if the call conditions stipulate specific security provisions for subcontracting to protect the EU
security interests (e.g. the exclusion of contractors not established in EU Member States) then the
pillar-assessed entity has to follow the criteria provided for in the call irrespective of its own
positively-assessed practices, its own membership etc. The application of other rules would put the
EU security interests at risk and would thus call into question the award decision.
If the pillar assessment resulted in findings that require remedial measures (i.e. ‘supervisory
measures’ in the meaning of Article 157(3) EU Financial Regulation 2024/250929) for certain
pillars, the pillar-assessed entity must apply these remedial measures, mutatis mutandis,
also for the grant (if it would like to rely on its own systems, rules and procedures).
Example: A pillar-assessed entity is a beneficiary in a Grant Agreement that requires the provision
of financial support to third parties (FSTP) in the form of grants and the subsequent publication of
recipient information. The entity has been positively assessed in the grants pillar; however, the
auditors had findings in the publication pillar. If the Commission therefore imposes supervisory
measures requiring the pillar-assessed entity to publish regularly all grant recipients that profit
from EU funds on the entity’s website, the pillar-assessed entity will have to follow this measure
also for the financial support to third parties given under the Grant Agreement, if it intends to rely
on its own systems, rules and procedures.
28 [old Financial Regulation: Article 154 Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
29 [old Financial Regulation: Article 154(3) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
173EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The application of remedial/supervisory measures for failed pillars should not lead to a
situation where the pillar-assessed entity is subject to stricter rules than other participants,
i.e. obligations that go beyond the requirements set out in the Grant Agreement. In this case
the pillar-assessed entity can choose to apply the grant rules instead of the agreed
remedial/supervisory measures.
The granting authority must be immediately informed of any change to the systems, rules
and procedures. If the pillar-assessed entity relies on systems, rules and procedures that
have not been positively assessed, the costs and contributions may be rejected and the grant
reduced.
Specific rules apply in particular with respect to cases of recovery, liability, suspension and
termination owing to the specific nature of pillar-assessed entities (usually public law bodies,
international organisations etc.) and their frame of cooperation with the granting authority.
List of specific rules for pillar-assessed entities:
▪ Recovery: If a pillar-assessed entity provides financial support to third parties
(FSTP) and eventually it turns out (e.g. following a check by the pillar-assessed
entity) that the recipients have received undue amounts, the pillar-assessed entity
should try to recover the undue amounts from the recipients and can do so,
following its own positively assessed rules and procedures. These amounts would
normally be considered as ineligible costs under the Grant Agreement. However, if
despite best efforts by the pillar-assessed entity the undue amounts cannot be
recovered from the recipients, the granting authority will also not recover the
corresponding amount from the pillar-assessed entity (unless the non-recovery is
due to error or negligence on part of the pillar-assessed entity).
▪ Liability: Normally, participants have to compensate the granting authority for
damages they caused in connection to the implementation of action (see Article
33.2). However, pillar-assessed entities will not have to compensate the granting
authority for such damages if the pillar-assessed entity was in compliance with its
own positively-assessed rules and procedures and did not violate the rights of any
third parties.
▪ Suspension: Normally, if the Grant Agreement is suspended, cost incurred during
the suspension period will not be eligible. However, for pillar assessed entities
costs may be eligible even during grant suspension to ensure the resumption of
the action after the suspension and to serve payments under legal commitments
such as purchase and subcontracts which were concluded by the pillar-assessed
entity for the implementation of the action before the pillar-assessed entity was
informed of a possible suspension, provided the payment obligations under these
commitments can themselves not be temporarily stopped (e.g. suspended for the
period of the Grant Agreement suspension).
▪ Termination: Similarly, in case of Grant Agreement termination, pillar-assessed
entities may be reimbursed for (unavoidable) cost for legal commitments such as
purchase- and subcontracts which were concluded by the pillar-assessed entity for
the implementation of the action before information on a possible termination was
received, even if execution of the contracts would only take place after the
payment of the balance. As in the case of suspension, the pillar-assessed entity
has to take all reasonable effort to reduce such cost e.g. by terminating the
contracts at the earliest opportunity.
174EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If there is an applicable framework agreement within the meaning of Article 131 EU Financial
Regulation 2024/2509 (i.e. Financial Framework Partnership Agreement (FFPA))30 concluded
between the European Commission and the pillar-assessed entity, the grant-relevant
provisions in the financial framework partnership agreement may be applied, provided they
do not fall under the list of provisions that would breach the principle of equal treatment or
call into question the decision awarding the grant , e.g. regarding audits.
Record-keeping — If a pillar-assessed entity relies on its own positively-assessed rules for
record-keeping, it must still ensure that these record-keeping rules are in line with obligations
under the Grant Agreement, e.g. record-keeping must be done in a way that allows checks,
reviews and audits (under the rules of a financial framework partnership agreement, if applicable)
and follow the rules for recording of time worked on the action for the calculation of personnel
costs.

SECTION 2 RULES FOR CARRYING OUT THE ACTION
General > Article 11 — Proper implementation of the action
ARTICLE 11 — PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION
ARTICLE 11 — PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION
11.1 Obligation to properly implement the action
The beneficiaries must implement the action as described in Annex 1 and in compliance with the provisions
of the Agreement, the call conditions and all legal obligations under applicable EU, international and national
law.
11.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Proper implementation of the action
The action must be properly implemented, i.e. implemented in accordance with the
beneficiaries’ obligations. These obligations include the obligations stemming explicitly from
the Grant Agreement but also include any other rules applicable to the activities of the
project. The obligations to properly implement the action requires:
− that the action (i.e. the work) must be carried out as described in the description of
the action (DoA; Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement)
− compliance with the provisions of the Agreement (other than those set out in the DoA;
Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement)
− compliance with the call conditions as set out in all the documents accompanying the
call for proposals
AND
− compliance with all the applicable provisions of EU, international and national law.
The requirement to properly implement the action is a general obligation to implement the
grant in good faith in compliance with any applicable rules (whether specifically listed in the Grant
Agreement or not) at any step of implementation. It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to be aware
of this and apply it to their project.
The work must be done properly (good quality) and on time. Participants must prevent
delays (or reduce them as much as possible). In addition, important delays should be
immediately signalled to the granting authority (see Article 19).
When implementing the action as set out in the description of the action (DoA; Annex 1 of
the Grant Agreement), all work on the project must comply with the obligations set out in
other parts of the Grant Agreement, in particular the rules for carrying out the action (e.g.
data protection, confidentiality; see also Annex 5).
Example: As part of the activities set out in your description of the action, you are
subcontracting the conduct of a survey. Even though you have to ensure the proper technical
conduct of the survey as described in the action and ensure submission of the deliverable within
the time limits of the action under the terms of the grant, you also have to comply with the rules
176EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
on subcontracting, any applicable data protection rules etc. Otherwise, the granting authority
may reject cost or reduce your grant even if you provided your deliverable in good quality and on
time.
This means in practice that full compliance with all obligations at all time is expected.
Apart from obligations explicitly specified in the Grant Agreement and its Annexes, the
beneficiaries must also comply with the call conditions (e.g. conditions on geographic
eligibility, eligible participants, financial support to third parties (FSTP), specific cost eligibility
rules, etc). These conditions must be fulfilled throughout the implementation of the project.
Example: The call conditions provide that entities subject to EU restrictive measures (also called
‘sanctions’) cannot participate in the grant in any capacity, including as associated partners or
subcontractors.
The granting authorities cannot know in advance and therefore cannot specify all possible
obligations that a beneficiary may have in connection with the activities under the Grant
Agreement. Accordingly the Grant Agreement includes the general obligations to comply with
all the applicable provisions of EU, international and national law (including general
principles, such as fundamental rights, values and ethical principles).
If activities take place in several countries, the participants must comply with the national
law of the country in which they are established AND that of the country (or countries) where
the action is implemented.
Example: Each beneficiary must comply in particular with the labour law applicable to the
personnel working on the action and must fulfil the tax and social obligations related to the
activities it carries out under the applicable national law. If a part of the activities is done in
another country, the applicable rules must be respected.
This obligation also requires compliance with other legal acts and other binding or non-
binding rules and guidance in the area concerned (see definition of ‘Applicable EU,
international and national law’ in Article 2). This includes applicable professional code of
conducts, sectoral guidance, but also covers relevant legal acts such as work programmes
adopted by the granting authority or guidance provided by the granting authority.
Example: Activities in the course of the project may require the involvement of certain
professions whose work is governed by sector- or profession-specific guidelines or codes of
conducts, e.g. in healthcare. The proper implementation of the action would normally oblige the
beneficiary to comply with all such guidelines or codes of conduct in concerned areas of work
(unless the description of the action explicitly requires otherwise, e.g. to test innovative new
methods, within the boundaries of binding rules).
It also includes compliance with relevant legal acts such as the conditions set out in work
programmes adopted by the granting authority and applicable to the action, or any guidance
provided by the granting authority.
Specific cases (proper implementation):
Conflicts between applicable rules — The beneficiaries remain fully responsible to plan
and implement their action in a way that ensures the exercise of the rights by the granting
authority/other EU bodies, including for checks, reviews, audits and investigations. If conflicts
with applicable (e.g. national/third country) rules prevent the exercise of these rights (e.g.
access to records or results) the granting authority may reject costs, reduce the grant or
terminate the participation of the beneficiary (or the Grant Agreement).
Conflicts with security rules — Be aware that national/third country security requirements
(national/third country security classification, national export restrictions, etc) may affect the
project implementation (and even put it at risk). It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to avoid
this and to keep your project free of such restrictions, either by adapting the action or by
obtaining all necessary authorisations to be able to comply with your obligations under the
Grant Agreement (see also specific case above). Any potential security issues should
immediately be notified to the granting authority.
177EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: According to national rules a personnel security clearance (PSC) may be required for
accessing information even below CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL level. If this prevents the
granting authority, ECA, OLAF or EPPO from exercising their rights, the reference to conflicting
national rules will not release the beneficiary from contractual obligations and the granting
authority will take the necessary measures (e.g. rejection of cost due to lack of supporting
documents).

General > Article 12 — Conflict of interests
ARTICLE 12 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
ARTICLE 12 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
12.1 Conflict of interests
The beneficiaries must take all measures to prevent any situation where the impartial and objective
implementation of the Agreement could be compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life,
political or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect interest (‘conflict of interests’).
They must formally notify the granting authority without delay of any situation constituting or likely to lead
to a conflict of interests and immediately take all the necessary steps to rectify this situation.
The granting authority may verify that the measures taken are appropriate and may require additional
measures to be taken by a specified deadline.
12.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28)
and the grant or the beneficiary may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Conflict of interests
The beneficiaries must ensure that the action is implemented impartially and objectively, as
described in the Grant Agreement. They must do their best to take all measures to avoid
conflicts of interest. Persons working on the action should in particular:
− refrain from taking any action which may bring them into a situation of conflict of
interests
− take appropriate measures to prevent conflicts of interest from arising in the tasks
under their responsibility
− take appropriate measures to address any situations which may objectively be
perceived as a conflict of interests
AND
− report any conflict of interests, or situations that could be perceived as a conflict of
interests.
Best Practice: It is recommended that the beneficiaries have a system in place that allows (at
least) persons working on the action to declare conflicts of interests and clear rules how to
address such situations. Awareness-raising activities should be carried out regularly.
‘Conflicts of interests’ can negatively affect the action and may lead to a rejection of cost or
grant reduction, in particular if a conflict of interests affects the action’s implementation in
terms of:
− quality, e.g. if a conflict of interest leads to persons/contractors not best qualified for
the work
OR
− cost, e.g. if a conflict of interest leads to award of (sub)contract’s or purchases not
offering best value for money or lowest price.
179EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Conflicts of interests must be avoided irrespective of whether they actually affect quality or
cost, or whether the persons involved actually gain any benefit (or not).
Conflicts may be resulting from direct or indirect interests in relation to:
− family or emotional ties, while often connected, avoidance of conflict of interests
due to ‘family’ or ‘emotional life’ are separate obligations. An emotional bond between
family members is therefore not required for a person’s impartiality to be
compromised by reasons involving family, e.g. subcontracts with business owned by
family members, even if no close emotional ties exist
Examples:
Direct interest: A person works for a beneficiary who plans to subcontract a task. A company
owned by the person’s spouse may submit an offer. In this case the person working for the
beneficiary could have a direct interest in awarding the spouse’s company (and therefore would
need to declare a conflict of interest and abstain from being involved in the preparation and
award of the subcontract).
Indirect interest: A person works for a beneficiary who plans to subcontract a task. A
company may submit an offer. The person’s spouse my work for a usual supplier of that
company, or my own facilities or land that would be used by that company in case it
implements the subcontract. In this case the person working for the beneficiary could have an
indirect interest in awarding the company (and therefore would need to declare a conflict of
interest and abstain from being involved in the preparation and award of the subcontract).
− political or national affinity, this concerns situations where beneficiaries or third
parties may be chosen, or activities carried out, based on political or national
considerations (although a mere link with beliefs, views, opinions or preferences of the
person does not automatically constitute a personal interest)
Example: The CEO of a beneficiaries selects a contractor, or a site for a demonstration, not
based on objective and verifiable criteria on the merits, but instead selects a compatriot as
contractor or a demonstration site due to the political party membership of the local mayor.
− economic interests which include, but are not limited to, direct financial benefits
Examples:
1. A beneficiary or a person working for a beneficiary subcontracts work to another legal entity
because it is a shareholder in this other legal entity.
2. A professor working for a beneficiary (a university) subcontracts work to a consultancy firm
in which the professor is a partner.
3. A beneficiary agrees to award a subcontract to a company in exchange for preferential
treatment in that company’s own future contracting.
4. A person working for a beneficiary receives an offer for a subcontract from a company for
which the person has applied for a position.
− other direct and indirect interests, which can include reception of gifts or
hospitality, non-economic interests, or result from involvement with e.g. non-
governmental organisations (even if non-remunerated), resulting in competing duties
of loyalty between one entity the person owes a duty to and another person or entity
the person owes a duty.
Examples:
1. To discuss its proposed offer, a potential subcontractor has invited staff of the beneficiary to
its premises, including hotel accommodation, dinner and gifts.
2. A person involved in subcontracting of a beneficiary is also holding an office in a local NGO.
The President of the NGO owns a company that may become the subcontractor.
If there is a (risk of) a conflict of interests, the coordinator must inform the granting
authority so that steps can be agreed to resolve the situation and avoid cost rejection or
reduction of the grant.
180EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This may result in the requirement by the granting authority to put in place certain
measures, in particular for persons with a perceivable risk of conflict of interest to withdraw
from any decision-making that could affect their direct or indirect interest.

General > Article 13 — Confidentiality and security
ARTICLE 13 — CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
ARTICLE 13 — CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
13.1 Sensitive information
The parties must keep confidential any data, documents or other material (in any form) that is identified as
sensitive in writing (‘sensitive information’) — during the implementation of the action and for at least until
the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6).
If a beneficiary requests, the granting authority may agree to keep such information confidential for a longer
period.
Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, they may use sensitive information only to implement the
Agreement.
The beneficiaries may disclose sensitive information to their personnel or other participants involved in the
action only if they:
(a) need to know it in order to implement the Agreement and
(b) are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
The granting authority may disclose sensitive information to its staff and to other EU institutions and bodies.
It may moreover disclose sensitive information to third parties, if:
(a) this is necessary to implement the Agreement or safeguard the EU financial interests and
(b) the recipients of the information are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
The confidentiality obligations no longer apply if:
(a) the disclosing party agrees to release the other party
(b) the information becomes publicly available, without breaching any confidentiality obligation
(c) the disclosure of the sensitive information is required by EU, international or national law.
Specific confidentiality rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
13.2 Classified information
The parties must handle classified information in accordance with the applicable EU, international or national
law on classified information (in particular, Decision 2015/444 and its implementing rules).
Deliverables which contain classified information must be submitted according to special procedures agreed
with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted only after explicit approval (in writing)
from the granting authority.
Classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants involved in the action
implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the granting authority.
Specific security rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
13.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
182EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Sensitive information — Confidentiality
If the project involves, uses or generates information that should not be made public (e.g.
commercially sensitive information, business or trade secrets, confidential market data,
valuable results not yet protected by intellectual property rights, security-sensitive
information, etc), it should be identified and handled as ‘sensitive’ in accordance with the
provisions in Article 13.1 (and Annex 5, if the Grant Agreement sets out specific rules for the
programme, e.g. HE).
For actions raising specific concerns, such as security or public order (e.g. involving
strategic assets), beneficiaries may have to comply with additional obligations before and
after the grant award. For example, in some programmes (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF), actions
linked to security concerns may have to undergo a security review before selection and may
be made subject to specific security recommendations in Annex 1.
Sensitive information (former ‘confidential’; new for 2021-2027) must be kept confidential —
during the action and for at least five years afterwards (see Data Sheet, Point 6) — meaning
that they may be disclosed only within the strict limits of what is allowed under Article 13, in
particular to implement the Grant Agreement or protect the EU financial interests.
The confidentiality obligation is a minimum obligation: Beneficiaries may extend the period
and agree to additional confidentiality-related obligations among themselves (for example,
for access for other participants). Moreover, they may ask the granting authority to extend
the period. This request must explain why and clearly identify the sensitive information
concerned.
Best practice: In order to avoid issues, it is recommended that beneficiaries inform each
other and the granting authority in case they know about laws that would require disclosing
sensitive information. This can allow to work together to minimise any negative effects.
2. EU-classified information
If the project uses or generates information that is (or must be) classified, additional rules
and procedures will apply in line with Article 13.2 (and Annex 5, if the Grant Agreement sets
out specific rules for the programme).
These are in particular:
− security rules for protecting EU classified information set out in Decision No
2015/44431 and its implementing rules on classified grants32 and programme security
instruction (PSI), if any (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF,) and
− national rules on the protection of classified information.
31 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p.53).
32 Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2021/259 of 10 February 2021 laying down implementing rules on
industrial security with regard to classified grants (OJ L 58, 19.2.2021, p. 55).
183EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In addition, security of information agreements concluded by the EU with third countries or
international organisations may also be indirectly relevant (for instance, may be a pre-
condition for awarding (or not) the grant by the granting authority), but they do not impose
any direct obligations for on the consortium (do not directly apply to them).
Projects expected to involve EU classified information (EUCI) will have to undergo a security
review procedure before selection, to set EU classification levels and other security
recommendations (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF, CEF).
Example: Some of the information produced by a project could potentially be used to plan
terrorist attacks or avoid detection of criminal activities.
For more guidance on classification of information and security obligations, see How to handle
security-sensitive projects, Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe
projects and Guidelines on the classification of information in Digital Europe projects.
3. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional rules may be set out in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF
CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM, EDF).

General > Article 14 — Ethics and values
ARTICLE 14 — ETHICS AND VALUES
ARTICLE 14 — ETHICS AND VALUES
14.1 Ethics
The action must be carried out in line with the highest ethical standards and the applicable EU, international
and national law on ethical principles.
Specific ethics rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
14.2 Values
The beneficiaries must commit to and ensure the respect of basic EU values (such as respect for human
dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities).
Specific rules on values (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
14.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Ethics
The action must ensure ethics compliance, this obligation is twofold:
− the action is in line with the highest ethical standards and
− the action ensures compliance with applicable international, EU and national law.
Main ethical principles:
▪ Respecting human dignity and integrity
▪ Ensuring honesty and transparency and notably getting free and informed consent
(as well as assent whenever relevant)
▪ Protecting vulnerable persons
▪ Ensuring privacy and confidentiality
▪ Promoting justice and inclusiveness
▪ Minimising harm and maximising benefit
▪ Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially in developing
countries
▪ Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction and
refinement in animal research
▪ Respecting and protecting the environment and present/future generations
The key sources of EU and international law are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols (for
other texts). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (UN CRPD).
Activities exposed to ethics risks usually run an ethics review as part of their grant selection
procedures (HE, DEP and EDF). Other programmes may perform manual checks.
185EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For more guidance, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment (can be used for all
programmes and especially for HE, DEP and EDF).
2. Values
All EU policies and programmes must respect the values on which the EU is founded and
which are set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Furthermore, the EU
institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the Member States, when implementing
EU law, must respect the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights
of the European Union.
Based on Article 14.2, during the implementation of the action, the beneficiaries must commit
to and ensure the respect of EU values.
EU values:
▪ respect for human dignity
▪ freedom
▪ democracy
▪ equality, including equality between women and men, non-discrimination
▪ rule of law
▪ respect for human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities
▪ pluralism, tolerance, justice, solidarity.
Accordingly, there can be no discrimination based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin,
genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a
national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation during the
implementation of the action or work programme.
3. Breaches of ethics or EU values
Breaches of ethics or EU values under this Article may lead to grant reductions (see Article
28) or other measures described in Chapter 5, such as rejection of costs or contributions,
payment deadline suspension, payment suspension, GA suspension, beneficiary or GA
termination, damages and administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures
and/or financial penalties).
Be aware that these measures may be taken not only when the beneficiary itself
breached the EU values, also when other persons and entities, such as its affiliated entities,
associated partners, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)
(see Articles 8, 9.1, 9.3 and 9.4) OR persons having powers of representation, decision-
making or control, or persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant breach
them (see Article 32).
Examples: Termination of a beneficiary because a person having powers of representation for the
beneficiary makes a public statement which discriminates against religion or belief.
4. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional rules may be set out in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, DEP, EDF
EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, EDF, EU4H, Euratom, RELEX).

ARTICLE 15 — DATA PROTECTION
15.1 Data processing by the granting authority
Any personal data under the Agreement will be processed under the responsibility of the data controller of
the granting authority in accordance with and for the purposes set out in the Portal Privacy Statement.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission, an EU regulatory or executive agency,
joint undertaking or other EU body, the processing will be subject to Regulation 2018/172538.
38 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data,
and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).
1. Processing of personal data (by the EU)
The granting authority will process personal data in compliance with Regulation 2018/172533
and as set out in the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy Statement.
When the granting authority collects and processes personal data under the Grant
Agreement, national data protection law is NOT applicable and will NOT be accepted as a
justification for not complying with obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Personal data will be processed only for the purpose of implementing, managing and
monitoring the grant implementation/compliance with the provisions under the Grant
Agreement or protecting EU financial interests (including controls on eligibility of costs,
proper implementation of the action and compliance with other obligations).
The level of detail of the data requested will depend on the process and situation and will be
limited to what is necessary (data minimisation).
The processing of personal data under the Grant Agreement (manual or electronic) is notified
(by the data controller) to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) of the European Commission. In
addition, for processing that implies specific risks to the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects (e.g. processing of data relating to health), the European Data Protection Supervisor
(EDPS) will be consulted.
The notifications are available via the Register of the DPO1 (and describe the processing
operations, legal basis, security safeguards, retention period, possible data transfer, etc).

2. Right to access and correct personal data
Persons whose data is being processed (data subjects) can contact the data controller or the
DPO (via the contact information in the Privacy Statement), to:
− correct errors in the data, block access or delete their data
− complain about the data collection and use, and claim compensation for any damage.
3. Complaints to the EDPS
Persons whose data is being processed (data subjects) can also lodge a complaint with the
European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) (i.e. the independent supervisory authority for
data processing by EU institutions).
Best practice: Please contact first contact the data controller (see above) to clarify concerns
or solve problems regarding your data.

15.2 Data processing by the beneficiaries
15.2 Data processing by the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must process personal data under the Agreement in compliance with the applicable EU,
international and national law on data protection (in particular, Regulation 2016/67939).
They must ensure that personal data is:
- processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subjects
- collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is
incompatible with those purposes
- adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed
- accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
- kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
purposes for which the data is processed and
- processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the data.
The beneficiaries may grant their personnel access to personal data only if it is strictly necessary for
implementing, managing and monitoring the Agreement. The beneficiaries must ensure that the personnel is
under a confidentiality obligation.
The beneficiaries must inform the persons whose data are transferred to the granting authority and provide
them with the Portal Privacy Statement.
15.3 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
39 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (‘GDPR’) (OJ L 119,
4.5.2016, p. 1).
1. Processing of personal data (by the Consortium)
During the implementation of the action, the beneficiaries will collect and process personal
data, e.g. of their own staff, staff of other participants, and may also share such data with
the granting authority. In all such instances, the personal data must be processed in line with
the provisions under the Grant Agreement, in particular in compliance with applicable EU and
national law on data protection (in particular, with the General Data Protection Regulation
2016/67934 (GDPR)).

189EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The data protection obligations (e.g. to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully,
fairly and in a transparent manner) are a contractual obligation under the Grant Agreement
and apply to all beneficiaries, irrespective of whether the GDPR is directly applicable to them
or whether applicable national law provides for such requirements (or not).
According to those rules, personal data must be processed according to certain principles and
conditions (see EDPB data protection guide for small business).
‘Personal data’ means any information, private or professional, which relates to an identified
or identifiable natural person (for the full definition, see Article 4(1) GDPR).
− name, surname, phone numbers (e.g. staff)
− identification numbers, such as an individual’s client number, an individual’s employee
number
− a booking reference
− email addresses, location data
− photos, videos and audio recordings containing images or sounds of individuals.
Processing of special categories of data is in principle prohibited, except in the specific
circumstances set out in Article 9(2) GDPR.
Data that reveals information about health, sex life or sexual orientation, racial or ethnic
origin political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, biometric and genetic data or trade
union membership (so-called ‘sensitive data’) is subject to specific rules for the processing, in
order to protect it more.
‘Processing’ means any operation (or set of operations) which is performed on personal data,
either manually or by automatic means. This includes:
− − collection
− − recording
− − organisation
− - structuring
− - storage
− - adaptation or alteration
− − retrieval and consultation
− − use
− − disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available
− − alignment or combination
− − restriction, erasure or destruction.
190EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Examples (processing of personal data): creating a mailing list or a list of participants;
managing a database; accounting records on personnel costs; time-sheets; project planning with
names
Personal data must be processed according to certain principles and conditions that aim to
ensure both data quality and confidentiality35.
The beneficiaries must give their staff access to personal data on a need to know basis, for
carrying out their tasks/functions under the Grant Agreement. This means that the
beneficiaries must put in place adequate access controls and retention policies for the various
categories of data they hold.
The beneficiaries must inform persons (including their staff whose personal data are collected
and processed) about the disclosure of their data to the granting authority by providing them
with the Privacy Statement.
Examples:
1. Before encoding staff data in the Participant Register or into a proposal, the beneficiary must
provide the staff concerned with the privacy statement.
2. If in an ex-post audit, the Granting Authority requests the names, CVs, time-sheets and salaries
of the beneficiary’s staff (to check the eligibility of personnel costs), the beneficiary must inform
the staff concerned and provide them with the privacy statement.
The beneficiaries must ensure for all their data collection and processing a valid legal basis
(see EDPB data protection guide for small business > Process personal data lawfully). Special
attention is required were personal data is transferred to third countries (see EDPB data
protection guide for small business > International data transfers).
Specific cases (data protection):
International organisations (IOs) — The application of the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) is without prejudice to the provisions of international law, such as the
ones governing the privileges and immunities of international organisations (see Articles
10.2). The international organisations are subject to their own data protection internal rules /
regulatory frameworks. At the same time, any controller or processor that falls within the
scope of the GDPR for a given processing activity, and that exchanges personal data with
international organisations, has to comply with the GDPR rules on transfers to international
organisations. Agreements can build on elements already existing in the data protection
internal rules / regulatory framework of the international organisation.

RESULTS — ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE
ARTICLE 16 — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) — BACKGROUND AND
RESULTS —ACCESS RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE
16.1 Background and access rights to background
The beneficiaries must give each other and the other participants access to the background identified as
needed for implementing the action, subject to any specific rules in Annex 5.
‘Background’ means any data, know-how or information — whatever its form or nature (tangible or
intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that is:
(a) held by the beneficiaries before they acceded to the Agreement and
(b) needed to implement the action or exploit the results.
If background is subject to rights of a third party, the beneficiary concerned must ensure that it is able to
comply with its obligations under the Agreement.
16.2 Ownership of results
The granting authority does not obtain ownership of the results produced under the action.
‘Results’ means any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as data, know-how or information,
whatever its form or nature, whether or not it can be protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including
intellectual property rights.
16.3 Rights of use of the granting authority on materials, documents and information received for
policy, information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes
The granting authority has the right to use non-sensitive information relating to the action and materials and
documents received from the beneficiaries (notably summaries for publication, deliverables, as well as any
other material, such as pictures or audio-visual material, in paper or electronic form) for policy information,
communication, dissemination and publicity purposes — during the action or afterwards.
The right to use the beneficiaries’ materials, documents and information is granted in the form of a royalty-
free, non-exclusive and irrevocable licence, which includes the following rights:
(a) use for its own purposes (in particular, making them available to persons working for the granting
authority or any other EU service (including institutions, bodies, offices, agencies, etc.) or EU
Member State institution or body; copying or reproducing them in whole or in part, in unlimited
numbers; and communication through press information services)
(b) distribution to the public (in particular, publication as hard copies and in electronic or digital
format, publication on the internet, as a downloadable or non-downloadable file, broadcasting by any
channel, public display or presentation, communicating through press information services, or
inclusion in widely accessible databases or indexes)
(c) editing or redrafting (including shortening, summarising, inserting other elements (e.g. meta-data,
legends, other graphic, visual, audio or text elements), extracting parts (e.g. audio or video files),
dividing into parts, use in a compilation)
(d) translation
(e) storage in paper, electronic or other form
(f) archiving, in line with applicable document-management rules
192EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(g) the right to authorise third parties to act on its behalf or sub-license to third parties the modes of use
set out in Points (b), (c), (d) and (f), if needed for the information, communication and publicity
activity of the granting authority and
(h) processing, analysing, aggregating the materials, documents and information received and
producing derivative works.
The rights of use are granted for the whole duration of the industrial or intellectual property rights concerned.
If materials or documents are subject to moral rights or third party rights (including intellectual property
rights or rights of natural persons on their image and voice), the beneficiaries must ensure that they comply
with their obligations under this Agreement (in particular, by obtaining the necessary licences and
authorisations from the rights holders concerned).
Where applicable, the granting authority will insert the following information:
“© – [year] – [name of the copyright owner]. All rights reserved. Licensed to the [name of granting authority] under conditions.”
16.4 Specific rules on IPR, results and background
Specific rules regarding intellectual property rights, results and background (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
16.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such a breach may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Background and access rights to background
In order to ensure a successful project, the participants must give each other mutual access
to background that is necessary for the project implementation (and thus get an overview of
the relevant background and identify if it is needed for the action).
Specific (or different) conditions and additional rules on access to background are
provided for some programmes in Annex 5 (e.g. HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF).
‘Background’ means any tangible or intangible input — from data to know-how, information
or rights — that exists before the grant is signed and that is needed to implement the action
or to exploit its results (e.g. database rights, patents, prototypes, cell lines, etc).
Background is not limited to input owned, but potentially extends to anything the
beneficiaries lawfully hold (e.g. through a licence with the right to sub-licence). If a
beneficiary is a legal person, it also extends to input held by other parts of the beneficiary’s
organisation.
For registered intellectual property rights (‘Intellectual property’ being understood in the
meaning defined in Article 2 of the Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property
Organisation36), it suffices that the application was filed before the grant is signed.
36 Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organisation, signed in Stockholm on 14 July 1967.
Available at http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/convention/trtdocs_wo029.html.
193EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If access to background is subject to restrictions due to the rights of third parties, the
beneficiary should inform the other beneficiaries — before signing the grant — to ensure that
the beneficiaries are still able to comply with their grant obligations.
Example: A beneficiary holding background is by a pre-existing agreement (e.g. licence
agreement) restricted in the access it can grant to such background. The beneficiaries may agree to
exclude the background. Such an exclusion may be temporary (e.g. to permit the adequate
protection of the background before providing access) or limited (e.g. to exclude only one or more
specific beneficiaries). But since background is by definition considered to be needed for the
implementation or exploitation, the impact of such an exclusion on the (especially if not temporary)
should be carefully examined by the beneficiaries.
Best practice: Although not obligatory, beneficiaries are advised to agree in writing on
background before the grant is signed, to ensure that they have access rights to what is
needed for implementing the action, including exploiting its results. The agreement may take
any form (e.g. positive list, negative list). It may be a separate agreement or may be part of
the consortium agreement. If after grant signature beneficiaries come to hold useful inputs
relevant to implement the action, they should endeavour to come to an agreement how such
inputs can be used in the action.
2. Ownership of results
Results belong to the beneficiary(ies) that generated them. The granting authority does not
obtain ownership of the results produced under the action.
‘Results’ include the action’s tangible effects (e.g. data, prototypes, microorganisms),
intangible effects (e.g. know-how, formulas), as well as any attached rights (e.g. patent
rights and database rights). Results do not include the effects generated/produced by
activities outside of the project — be it before the action starts, during its course or after it
ends.
Best practice: To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, beneficiaries should keep documents
such as laboratory notebooks to show how and when they produced the results.
3. Rights of use of the granting authority for communication, dissemination and
publicity purposes
The granting authority may use (free of charge) any non-sensitive information relating to the
action and materials and documents received from the beneficiaries for policy, information,
communication, dissemination and publicity purposes — during the action or afterwards.
Examples (materials): Summaries for publication (submitted as part of the reports), public
deliverables and any other material provided by beneficiaries, such as pictures or audio-visual
material.
Examples (communication activities): Using a picture or the publishable summary included in
the final report submitted by the action to write a story about successful actions for a Commission
publication, or for speeches, etc.
Examples (publicising activities): Providing on a granting authority website information about
the action such as its name, a project summary, the participating partners, the EU funding, etc.
The right to use the beneficiaries’ materials, documents and information is granted in the
form of a royalty-free, non-exclusive and irrevocable licence, for the whole duration of the
industrial or intellectual property rights concerned
Beneficiaries may ask the granting authority to include a copyright notice (e.g. by including
such a notice in the material).
The beneficiaries must ensure that granting authority the can use the documents or materials
by making arrangements with any third parties that could claim rights to them.
If the granting authority needs to edit or redraft the material, it will be careful not to distort
any content.

General > Article 17 — Communication and visibility
ARTICLE 17 — COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY
ARTICLE 17 — COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION AND VISIBILITY
17.1 Communication — Dissemination — Promoting the action
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, the beneficiaries must promote the action and its results
by providing targeted information to multiple audiences (including the media and the public), in accordance
with Annex 1 and in a strategic, coherent and effective manner.
Before engaging in a communication or dissemination activity expected to have a major media impact, the
beneficiaries must inform the granting authority.
17.2 Visibility — European flag and funding statement
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, communication activities of the beneficiaries related to
the action (including media relations, conferences, seminars, information material, such as brochures,
leaflets, posters, presentations, etc., in electronic form, via traditional or social media, etc.), dissemination
activities and any infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, supplies or major result funded by the grant must
acknowledge the EU support and display the European flag (emblem) and funding statement (translated into
local languages, where appropriate):
The emblem must remain distinct and separate and cannot be modified by adding other visual marks, brands
or text.
Apart from the emblem, no other visual identity or logo may be used to highlight the EU support.
When displayed in association with other logos (e.g. of beneficiaries or sponsors), the emblem must be
displayed at least as prominently and visibly as the other logos.
For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the emblem without first
obtaining approval from the granting authority. This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.
Moreover, they may not appropriate the emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration or by
any other means.
196EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
17.3 Quality of information — Disclaimer
Any communication or dissemination activity related to the action must use factually accurate information.
Moreover, it must indicate the following disclaimer (translated into local languages where appropriate):
“Funded by the European Union. Views and opinions expressed are however those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily
reflect those of the European Union or [name of the granting authority]. Neither the European Union nor the granting authority can
be held responsible for them.”
17.4 Specific communication, dissemination and visibility rules
Specific communication, dissemination and visibility rules (if any) are set out in Annex 5.
17.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Communication, dissemination and promoting the action
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, the beneficiaries must promote the
action through communication and dissemination activities, by providing targeted information
to multiple audiences (including the media and the public), in a strategic and effective
manner and possibly engaging in a two-way exchange.
Security obligations — Respect of other obligations under the Grant Agreement may
limit in some cases the possibility to communicate about the action or disseminate (all of) its
results (e.g. security related obligations such as in case of grants involving classified
information; see Article 13).
The same may also be the case only temporarily, i.e. no communication until other
obligations under the Grant Agreement are fulfilled (e.g. until certain results are protected).
The beneficiaries are in principle free to choose the type of activities, but they should comply
with the principles below and in line with Annex 1.
Examples: A press release at the start of the action; an interview in the local radio station after
a major achievement of the action; organising workshops about the action; an event in a
shopping mall that shows how the outcomes of the action are relevant to our everyday lives;
producing a brochure to explain the action’s work to schools or university students.
The activities must be:
− effective (suited to achieving the action’s communication and dissemination goals) and
be proportionate to the scale of the action (activities carried out by a large-scale
action with beneficiaries coming from several different countries and a large budget
must be more ambitious than smaller actions)
− strategic (ad hoc efforts are NOT sufficient)
− coherent (avoid contradictory messages).
Moreover, the activities must address multiple audiences (beyond the action’s own
community), including the media and the public, in a way that can be understood by non-
specialists. They should highlight the action’s goals, results and include the public policy
perspective sought, e.g. by addressing aspects such as:
197EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− contribution to competitiveness and to solving societal challenges
− impact on everyday lives (e.g. creation of jobs, development of new technologies,
better quality products, more convenience, improved life-style, etc)
− actual or likely exploitation of the results by policy-makers, industry and other
communities
− transnational cooperation in a European consortium (i.e. how working together has
allowed to achieve more than otherwise possible).
The granting authority must be informed beforehand about any activity that is expected to
have a major media impact (media coverage in online and printed press, broadcast media,
social media, etc) that will go beyond having a local impact and which has the potential for
national and international outreach).
For more guidance and communication best practices, see Communicating about your EU-
funded project, EU communication network indicators, and the HE Social Media Guide.
For detailed instructions regarding the use of the European flag (emblem) and funding
statements (including downloadable pictures), see Guidelines on the use of the EU emblem in the
context of EU programmes 2021-2027.
2. Quality of information
Any communication or dissemination activity related to the action must use factually accurate
information. Should it later appear that certain information was not factually accurate (e.g.
new results obtained in a project disprove earlier information given about preliminary
results), the beneficiaries must take any appropriate and immediate steps to correct the
wrong information.
3. Specific rules in Annex 5
Depending on the programme, additional (or different) rules may be set out in Annex 5.

1. Specific rules for carrying out the action
For all EU programmes, specific rules for carrying out the action are set out in Annex 5.
These rules set out additional obligations that must be respected by the participants when
implementing the action activities. They are usually programme-specific and address
particular policy aspects and situations.
Like all other Annex 5 provisions, they are an integral part of the Grant Agreement and an
essential part of the obligations that must be complied with, in order to properly implement
the action.

ARTICLE 19 — GENERAL INFORMATION OBLIGATIONS
General > Article 19.1 Information requests
19.1 Information requests
ARTICLE 19 — GENERAL INFORMATION OBLIGATIONS
19.1 Information requests
The beneficiaries must provide — during the action or afterwards and in accordance with Article 7 — any
information requested in order to verify eligibility of the costs or contributions declared, proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the other obligations under the Agreement.
The information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
1. Requests for information
In addition to the specific information obligations set out in other parts of the Grant
Agreement (e.g. Articles 20.1, 25.1.2, 25.1.3 and 26.1), the granting authority may request
information from the beneficiaries, to verify that they:
− properly implemented the tasks described in Annex 1
− complied with their obligations under the Grant Agreement.
The granting authority may request any type of information it needs (including personal data
in order to verify that costs declared for specific people are eligible; see Article 15). The level
of detail will depend on the purpose of the request.
It may request the information for any purpose (e.g. checks for monitoring the action or
assessing reports and requests for payment; reviews; audits; investigations; evaluation of
the action’s impact).
The granting authority may request this information at any time, either during the action or
afterwards.
Examples:
1. In an ex-post audit that starts 18 months after the balance is paid, the granting authority may
request any information it needs during the audit procedure (see Article 25).
2. The granting authority may request information from the beneficiaries in order to evaluate the
action’s impact within the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet of the Grant Agreement (see Article
26).
The beneficiary concerned must provide accurate, precise and complete information, in the
format and within the deadline requested.
Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep records and other supporting documents
to prove the proper implementation of the action until the time-limit set out in the Data
Sheet (normally 5 years after final payment; see Article 20.1).
200EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Unless the Grant Agreement specifies direct communication with the other beneficiaries (e.g.
see Articles 7, 21, 25, 26, 39), the granting authority will (usually) contact the coordinator to
provide the information requested. All beneficiaries have to keep their contact information
updated in the Portal also after the end of the action, see Article 19.2.
Example: For audits after the end of the action, the granting authority will normally communicate
directly with the concerned beneficiary/affiliated entity.
All information exchanges should in principle take place through the the Portal, unless the
granting authority explicitly instructs or authorises otherwise (see Article 36).

General > Article 19.2 Participant Register update
19.2 Participant Register data updates
19.2 Participant Register data updates
The beneficiaries must keep — at all times, during the action or afterwards — their information stored in the
Portal Participant Register up to date, in particular, their name, address, legal representatives, legal form and
organisation type.
1. Information in the Participant Register
What? Each beneficiary must keep their information in the Participant Register up-to-date,
including after the end of the grant.
Updated information is required in particular during the time-limit for record-keeping set out
in the Data Sheet, e.g. for the purpose information requests for checks, reviews, audits and
investigation.
The information includes:
− name
− address
− legal representatives
− legal form (e.g. private limited liability company, public law body, S.A., S.L.)
− organisation type (e.g. SME, secondary or higher education establishment, etc.).
How? The information must be updated directly in the Portal Participant Register and will
then be available in the system.However, for important changes impacting the action
implementation, the coordinator should also be informed by the beneficiary (in writing).
More details on participant registration are explained in the Online Manual > Participant
Register.

General > Article 19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
19.3 Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
The beneficiaries must immediately inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) of any of the
following:
(a) events which are likely to affect or delay the implementation of the action or affect the EU’s
financial interests, in particular:
(i) changes in their legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation (including
changes linked to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour signed
before grant signature)
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action information: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with linked actions: [OPTION 1 by default: linked action information: not
applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the grant: changes regarding the linked action (see
Article 3)]]
(b) circumstances affecting:
(i) the decision to award the grant or
(ii) compliance with requirements under the Agreement.
19.4 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Information about events and circumstances which impact the action
What? Each beneficiary must immediately inform about any event that is likely to
(significantly) affect or delay the action’s implementation or affect the EU financial interests.
Such change include in particular (but are not limited to) legal, financial, technical,
organisational or ownership changes and, if required in the Grant Agreement, changes in the
linked actions (if any).
Examples: A beneficiary is under financial stress and chooses to liquidate; a beneficiary is
acquired by or merged with another legal entity; a beneficiary plans to move its facility from a
Member State to a (non-EU) third country; the consortium implementing a linked action dissolves
and no longer cooperates, affecting the implementation of the action as described in Annex 1.
The beneficiaries must also inform about any such changes concerning their affiliated entities.
How? The beneficiary concerned should normally inform the coordinator (through their usual
communication channels), who will then inform:
− the granting authority, via the Portal
− the other beneficiaries, through the usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail,
registered letters with proof of delivery, etc).
Best practice: It is recommended that these type of communications are done in writing (not
only orally).
203EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Register update — In many cases, the change may also require an update of the Participant
Register. Consult your LEAR and ask them to make the update.
2. Information about circumstances affecting the decision to award the grant or
compliance with requirements under the GA
What? Beneficiaries that become aware of circumstances (or changes thereof) that could
(potentially) affect the decision to award the grant or compliance with requirements under
the Grant Agreement must disclose them.
Relevant circumstances are those that:
− affect (or could have affected) the decision to award the grant, e.g. if the
information had been known at the time of evaluation it may have led to a different
scoring in the award criteria and may thus have affected the ranking of proposals,
and/or it would have led to rejection (e.g. due to ineligibility)
Example (eligibility): The eligibility criteria of a call require a consortium of three
beneficiaries established in Member States. During the action implementation, one of the
beneficiaries decides to relocate to a third country.
Example (award criteria): A consortium has three beneficiaries. One of them has a
laboratory with specialised equipment and personnel, including a team of internationally
renowned experts in the same field as the project. The quality of the work to be carried out by
this laboratory was taken into account by the evaluators for the scoring of the award criteria,
leading to a higher ranking of the proposal. During the action’s implementation, the beneficiary
sells the laboratory to an external company without involvement in the action, losing an
important part of the relevant expertise.
− affect (or could affect) the fulfilment of obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples (obligations):
1. Due to e.g. a merger, acquisition or contractual changes, certain intellectual property (e.g.
background identified as needed for implementing the action) becomes subject to rights of a
third party which no longer allows the beneficiary to implement the action as described in Annex
1, so the beneficiary can no longer comply with its obligations under the grant.
2. Due to a change of national legislation (e.g. security or export restrictions), the beneficiary
sees itself no longer able to provide deliverables and report on its activities in accordance with
the Grant Agreement.
Even if certain circumstances do not amount to a situation that would potentially affect the
decision to award the grant or compliance with requirements under the Grant Agreement, they may
still have to be notified under point (a) as events which are likely to affect or delay the
implementation of the action or affect the EU financial interests
How? The beneficiary concerned should normally inform the coordinator who will then inform
the granting authority and the other consortium members.
Based on the information, it is then up to the granting authority to assess whether the award
decision or the fulfilment of the obligations are actually affected and whether further
measures are required (incl. measures set out in Chapter 5).
Best practice: In case of doubt, the beneficiary should inform the granting authority (or
coordinator) for clarification.

General > Article 20 — Record-keeping
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
20.1 Keeping records and supporting documents
The beneficiaries must — at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6) — keep records
and other supporting documents to prove the proper implementation of the action in line with the accepted
standards in the respective field (if any).
In addition, the beneficiaries must — for the same period — keep the following to justify the amounts
declared:
(a) for actual costs: adequate records and supporting documents to prove the costs declared (such as
contracts, subcontracts, invoices and accounting records); in addition, the beneficiaries’ usual
accounting and internal control procedures must enable direct reconciliation between the amounts
declared, the amounts recorded in their accounts and the amounts stated in the supporting documents
(b) for flat-rate costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to prove the
eligibility of the costs or contributions to which the flat-rate is applied
(c) for the following simplified costs and contributions: the beneficiaries do not need to keep specific
records on the actual costs incurred, but must keep:
(i) for unit costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to
prove the number of units declared
(ii) for lump sum costs and contributions (if any): adequate records and supporting documents
to prove proper implementation of the work as described in Annex 1
(iii) for financing not linked to costs (if any): adequate records and supporting documents to
prove the achievement of the results or the fulfilment of the conditions as described in
Annex 1
(d) for unit, flat-rate and lump sum costs and contributions according to usual cost accounting practices
(if any): the beneficiaries must keep any adequate records and supporting documents to prove that
their cost accounting practices have been applied in a consistent manner, based on objective criteria,
regardless of the source of funding, and that they comply with the eligibility conditions set out in
Articles 6.1 and 6.2.
Moreover, the following is needed for specific budget categories:
(e) for personnel costs: time worked for the beneficiary under the action must be supported by
declarations signed monthly by the person and their supervisor, unless another reliable time-record
system is in place; the granting authority may accept alternative evidence supporting the time
worked for the action declared, if it considers that it offers an adequate level of assurance
(f) [OPTION 1 by default: additional record-keeping rules: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes
with additional record-keeping rules: [OPTION 1 by default: additional record-keeping rules: not
applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the call: for [insert name of budget category]: [insert specific
records/requirements]].]
The records and supporting documents must be made available upon request (see Article 19) or in the context
of checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the
Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 25), the beneficiaries must keep these records
and other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.
205EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are considered
originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The granting authority may accept non-
original documents if they offer a comparable level of assurance.
20.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions insufficiently
substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 27), and the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Records and other supporting documentation
The beneficiaries (and their affiliated entities) must keep appropriate and sufficient evidence
to prove the eligibility of all the costs declared, proper implementation of the action and
compliance with all the other obligations under the Grant Agreement. If costs are not
supported by appropriate and sufficient evidence, they will be rejected.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries that do not keep sufficient and appropriate supporting
documents will bear the full risk. The granting authority may take any measures set out in
Chapter 5, including to reject cost or reduce or terminate the grant. Systemic failure to keep
supporting documents may also lead to consequences in other EU actions (extension of audit
findings).
‘Sufficiency’ relates to the quantity of evidence; ‘appropriateness’ relates to its quality.
Evidence is considered sufficient and appropriate if it is persuasive enough to support the
facts or elements that need to be established. In the case of audits, the evidence will be
assessed by the auditors according to generally accepted audit standards.37
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.
Best practice: Where the nature of the action or participants may pose risks or difficulties for
checks, reviews, audits and investigations, the consortium may consider on procedures to
facilitate access to records, e.g. by depositing also adequate records with the coordinator, in
order to minimise the risk for cost rejections by the granting authority due to lack of access
to supporting documents.
The evidence must be correctly archived for the duration indicated in the Grant Agreement
(see Data Sheet, Point 6). In general, for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (3 years
for low-value grants up to EUR 60 000) or longer if there are ongoing procedures (audits,
investigations, litigation, etc). In this case, the evidence must be kept until ongoing
procedures end.
The rules in the Grant Agreement determine obligations under the EU action and do NOT
absolve the beneficiary from compliance with obligations under national law, e.g. national laws
requiring a longer retention period for keeping documents (or other additional measures).

In principle, the beneficiaries must keep original documents (i.e. documents considered as
original under national law) in the format in which they were received or created. This means
that:
− documents received or created in paper form should be kept in paper form
− documents received or created electronically should be kept in their electronic format
(hard copies of original electronic documents are NOT required).
Examples:
1. We will accept authenticated copies or digitally-signed documents, if national law accepts these
as originals.
2. We will accept digitalised copies of documents (instead of hard copies), if this is acceptable under
national law.
Exceptionally, the granting authority may accept non-original documents if they offer a
comparable level of assurance but this assessment is entirely up to the granting authority
and any beneficiary not keeping an original bears the full risk of cost rejection or grant
reduction.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should apply a consistent record-keeping policy, i.e. avoid that
non-original documents are presented only for the EU action whereas original records are
kept for other activities.
3. Records for actual costs
For actual costs, the beneficiaries must:
− keep detailed records and other supporting documents to prove the eligibility of the
costs declared
− use cost accounting practices and internal control procedures that make it possible to
verify that the amounts declared, amounts recorded in the accounts and amounts
recorded in supporting documentation match up.
The information included in the financial statements for each budget category (i.e. personnel
costs, subcontracting costs, etc) must be broken down into details and must match the
amounts recorded in the accounts and in supporting documentation.
Examples:
1. For costs declared in category A.1 Employees (or equivalent): the costs must be detailed for
each person carrying out work for the action (individual daily rate multiplied by day-equivalents
worked for the action). They must match the accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions,
annual financial statements) and supporting documentation (i.e. labour contracts, collective labour
agreements, applicable national law on taxes, labour and social security contributions, payslips,
time records, bank statements showing salary payments, etc).
2. For costs declared in category C. Purchase costs: the beneficiary must keep a breakdown of
costs declared by type (i.e. equipment cost, costs of other goods, works and services, etc). It
should be able to provide details of individual transactions for each type of cost. For depreciation, it
must be able to provide details per individual equipment used for the action. Declared costs must
match accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions, annual financial statements) and
supporting documentation (i.e. purchase orders, delivery notes, invoices, contracts, bank
statements, asset usage logbook, depreciation policy, etc).
4. Records for simplified cost and contributions, and financing not linked to cost
In contrast to actual cost, for simplified cost options (units, lump sums, flat-rates) and
financing not linked to cost, keeping of financial records on the actual cost incurred during
the action is NOT required.
207EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This does NOT however release the beneficiary from record-keeping rules under
applicable national law. The simplification relates to the EU grant-specific record-keeping
and reporting obligations.
Any financial and accounting records will not be assessed unless it is necessary for the
assessment of the implementation of the units, lump sums etc. declared, or to assess the
correctness of the methodology for beneficiaries using their usual cost accounting practices
(see below), or to assess the correctness of information provided in the proposal on which
basis a simplified cost amount was established.
− flat-rate costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and
other supporting documents to prove that the costs to which the flat-rate is applied
are eligible.
Example: For the flat-rate of indirect costs, the auditors will verify (and the beneficiaries must
be able to show) that the actual direct costs to which the flat-rate is applied are eligible.
− unit costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and other
supporting documents to prove the number of units declared.
− lump sum costs and contributions: the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the completion of the action tasks, the achievement of
results, or the fulfilment of the conditions as described in Annex 1.
− financing not linked to costs: the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and
supporting documents to prove the achievement of the results or the fulfilment of the
conditions as described in Annex 1.
5. Records for unit, flat-rate, lump sum costs and contributions calculated in
accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices
For unit, flat-rate, lump sum costs and contributions declared in accordance with usual cost
accounting practices, the beneficiaries must keep detailed records and other supporting
documents to:
− show that the method used is their usual cost accounting practice (i.e. not just used
for the EU grant)
− show that the method used for the initial calculation of the unit, flat-rate, or lump sum
appropriately reflects the actual costs as recorded in the statutory accounts
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): accounting records;
financial statement extracts; labour contracts; collective labour agreements; applicable tax,
labour and social security laws; pay slips; bank statements showing salary payments;
classification of employees (based on experience, qualifications, salary, department, etc).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): accounting records; financial
statement extracts; time records (or other records) for the share of personnel costs included in
the unit costs; invoices or contracts for maintenance costs, cleaning costs, other services, etc,
showing how the actual costs are directly or indirectly included in the unit cost calculation.
Manual interventions into the accounting data (if any) must be traceable and
documented.
− verify that the unit, flat-rate, lump sum are free of ineligible cost components
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): records that show that the
daily rate does not include an indirect cost component (they should be covered by the indirect
208EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
costs category); records that show that the daily rate does not include travel costs (they should
be claimed under category C.1 Travel and subsistence).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): evidence that shows that there is
no profit/margin/mark-up included in the internally invoiced goods and services (e.g. different
rates: one for billing the activity, with mark-up, and another one for internal costing, free of any
mark-up); lists of accounts/cost centres that were excluded from the calculation of internally
invoiced goods and services — because already included in the costs claimed under another
budget categories (e.g. under personnel costs)
− assess the acceptability of budgeted and estimated elements.
Examples:
1. For average personnel costs (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM, HUMA): records that show the
method for calculating the annual salary increases (e.g. consumer price index which, according
to the beneficiary’s usual remuneration policy, serves as the basis for annual salary increases).
2. For internally invoiced goods and services (HE, DEP, EDF): traceable data used to determine
the budgeted/ estimated elements; records on the nature and frequency of the updates of the
budgeted and estimated elements; etc.
It is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred during the action (per
person/good or service) — unless they are needed to document the usual cost accounting
practices.
6. Records for personnel costs — Day-equivalents worked for the action
For persons who work for the action (regardless if they are full-time or part-time employees
and/or if they work exclusively or not for the action; new for 2021-2027), the beneficiaries
may either:
− by default, sign a monthly declaration on day-equivalents worked for the action
(template)
OR
− use another paper- or computer-based reliable time recording system, to record (at
least) all the time (days/hours) worked for the action.
Best practice: It is recommended to explore the simplification potential of using monthly
declarations on days worked for the action. This limits record-keeping burden and avoids the
need for conversion of hours into day-equivalents.
Reliable time records must be dated and signed at least monthly by the person working for
the action and their supervisor.
NO rounding (up or down to the nearest half day-equivalent) for the time recording in
the monthly declarations. The rounding rule applies ONLY for the cost calculation (i.e. the
number of day-equivalents to declare and the maximum declarable day-equivalents) and for
the conversion from the total hours worked on the action into day-equivalents (in case of
time-recording systems based on hours). By contrast, it is NOT allowed to round up or down
to the nearest half day-equivalent in the monthly declaration.
Example: If a person with a standard working day of 8 hours worked 2 hours on the action during a
given month, 0,25 day-equivalents should be recorded for that month in their monthly declaration.
If the time recording system is computer-based, the signatures may be electronic (i.e. linking
the electronic identity data, e.g. a password and user name, to the electronic validation
data), with a documented and secure process for managing user rights and an auditable log
of all electronic transactions.
209EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Conversion of hours into day-equivalents: If you do not use the monthly declaration of
days, and instead record the time worked in hours, you must convert the total hours worked
into day-equivalents to calculate the personnel costs for the grant (see Article 6.2.A.1).
To convert hours into day-equivalents:
{number of hours worked by the person on the action during the reporting period
divided by
(number of hours of a day-equivalent)}
The resulting figure must be rounded up or down to the nearest half-day (e.g. 17,79 = 18
day-equivalents; 17,64 = 17,5 day-equivalents).
You have three options to determine the number of hours of a day-equivalent:
− Option 1: a day-equivalent is 8 hours
− Option 2: average working hours as per contract (or another binding document, e.g.
collective labour agreement, national labour legislation). You can NOT use this option
if the contract (or other binding document) does not allow to determine the average
number of hours that the person must work per day. By contrast, fluctuating or
variable working hours during the year are not a problem (see specific cases below).
− 2a: If the number of working hours is specified per day:
{working hours per day divided by working time factor}
Examples:
Full-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person is employed
full-time and must work 7,8 hours each working day. A day-equivalent for the
person is 7,8 hours (7,8 / 1 [working time factor]).
Part-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person is employed
50 % part-time and must work 4 hours each working day. A day-equivalent for the
person is 8 hours (4 / 0.5 [working time factor]).
− 2b: If the number of working hours is specified per week or month:
{(working hours per week [or month] divided by working time factor) divided by
working days per week [or month]}
For the calculation above, the number of ‘working days’ per week (or
month) is not the actual days worked by the person, but the standard number
of working days per week (or month) as per the beneficiary’s usual practices
(and applicable rules/laws). This is usually 5 working days per week (e.g.
Monday to Friday). The number should be the same for full-time and part-time
employees irrespective of the actual distribution of the (full or part-time)
working time over the week (or month).
Examples:
Full-time case: The employment contract establishes that the person must work
37,5 hours per week over 5 working days. A day-equivalent for the person is ((37,5
/ 1 [working time factor]) / 5 [days]) = 7,5 hours.
Part-time case (hours per week): The person is employed 50 % part-time and
the contract establishes that the person must work 18,75 hours per week
(consisting of five working days as per the beneficiary’s practice). In practice, the
person works two full days and a half each week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
morning). The number of working days to be used in the formula is 5 (NOT 2,5 or 3
actual days worked). A day-equivalent for the person is ((18.75 / 0.5 [working time
factor]) / 5 [days]) = 7,5 hours.
210EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Part-time case (hours per month): The person is employed 50 % part-time and
the contract establishes that the person must work 80 hours per month over 22
working days. A day-equivalent for the person is ((80 / 0,5 [working time factor]) /
22 [days]) = 7,3 hours.
− 2c: If the number of working hours is specified per year:
{(working hours per year divided by working time factor) divided by 215}
Example: If the collective labour agreement sets out 1612 hours of work per year
for full-time employees, the hours for the calculation must be adapted to 806 (1612
x 0,5) working hours per year for a 50% part-time employee, i.e. 806 / 0,5 / 215 =
7.5h day-equivalent.
− Option 3: If you have a usual cost accounting practice determining the standard
number of annual productive hours of a full-time employee, you may determine the
value of a day-equivalent as follows:
{(the higher between the standard number of annual productive hours of a full-time
employee and 90 % of the standard annual workable hours of a full-time employee)
divided by
215}
The chosen option must be applied consistently, i.e. using the same option at least
per group of personnel employed under similar conditions (e.g. same type of contract,
same cost-centre). You cannot apply the most favourable option for each employee
individually.
A conversion normally needs to be done only once per person per reporting period
for the purpose of reporting to the granting authority. It is not required that you keep a
parallel record system that directly converts hours into day-equivalents.
If you keep parallel time record systems, e.g. weekly time-sheets of hours and
monthly declarations of days, they must be consistent. In case of significant
discrepancies discovered e.g. during checks, reviews and audits, only the set of documents
recording the lower amount of days will be accepted.
Specific cases (conversion into day-equivalents):
Change of working hours during a reporting period — Option 2 (average working hours
as per contract) can also be used in case of work pattern changes (for instance, in case of an
amendment to the internal regulations and/or national (labour) law of the beneficiary
concerning daily working hours within the reporting period). In this case, the conversion from
hours to day equivalents must be done separately; in practice, you should perform a
separate conversion calculation for each period during which a different work pattern regime
was in effect. Then, sum the results to determine the total number of hours converted into
day-equivalents
Example: The beneficiary has decided to modify the working hours schedule effective from
01/01/2025, reducing the work day from 8 hours to 7 hours. The reporting period for the action is
from 01/01/2024 to 30/06/2025. The daily rate for each individual employee should be calculated
based on the hours worked (converted into day equivalents) during 2024 and 2025. The conversion
from hours to day equivalents should be calculated as follows:
A full-time employee of the beneficiary has recorded 800 hours in the year 2024 and 280 hours in
2025 for work on this project. To calculate the day equivalents worked for the action:
(800 hours worked in 2024 divided by the 8-hour day equivalent in 2024) plus (280 hours worked
in 2025 divided by the 7-hour day equivalent in 2025) equals 100 + 40, which totals 140 day
equivalents worked for the action.
Changes of working hours during different periods of each year (annual seasonal
fluctuation in working hours) — When the number of working hours fluctuates over the
211EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
year (e.g. 8 hours per day for all months except 7 hours per day during July and August), the
following formula must be applied:
{[(working hours per day multiplied by the number of months to which it applies) plus (working
hours per day multiplied by the number of months to which it applies)] divided by 12. The result
should then be divided by working time factor}
7. Records of affiliated entities, associated partners and other participants
In principle, each participant keeps their own records (to prove costs or proper
implementation; new for 2021-2027). In case of a check, review, audit or investigation, the
granting authority may ask the coordinator or responsible beneficiary to provide the
necessary documents.

General > Article 21 — Reporting
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
General > Article 21.1 Continuous reporting
21.1 Continuous reporting
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
21.1 Continuous reporting
The beneficiaries must report on the progress of the action (e.g. deliverables, milestones,
outputs/outcomes, critical risks, indicators, etc; if any), in the Portal Continuous Reporting tool and in
accordance with the timing and conditions it sets out (as agreed with the granting authority).
Standardised deliverables (e.g. progress reports not linked to payments, reports on cumulative expenditure,
special reports, etc; if any) must be submitted using the templates published on the Portal.
1. Continuous reporting
What? The beneficiaries must provide regular updates on the status of the action
implementation. This is the continuous reporting.
The continuous reporting may cover (non-exhaustive list):
− progress in achieving milestones, which are control points in the action that help to
chart progress (kick-off meetings, steering committees, first-draft of a survey,
prototype, etc); they may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, which
allows the next phase of the work to begin or is needed at intermediary points
− deliverables, which are additional outputs that must be produced at a given moment
during the action and submitted to the granting authority
Examples: Information, special report, a technical diagram brochure, list, a software milestone
or other building block of the action.
− response to critical risks, which are a plausible event or issue that could have a high
adverse impact on the ability of the action to achieve its objectives
− programme-specific monitoring information or indicators like those related to
publications, communications activities, IPRs, Open Data, Trainings, Gender etc. (if
required for your programme and depending on the type of action).
How & When? The deliverables (including progress reports not linked to payments, if any)
must be submitted through the Portal Continuous Reporting tool, in accordance with the
schedule set out for them. Both the schedule and templates to be used (if any) are available
through the Deliverables screen.
213EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 21.2 Periodic reporting
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
In addition, the beneficiaries must provide reports to request payments, in accordance with the schedule and
modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2):
- for additional pre-financings (if any): an additional pre-financing report
- for interim payments (if any) and the final payment: a periodic report.
The pre-financing and periodic reports include a technical and financial part.
The technical part includes an overview of the action implementation. It must be prepared using the template
available in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool.
The financial part of the additional pre-financing report includes a statement on the use of the previous pre-
financing payment.
The financial part of the periodic report includes:
− the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all beneficiaries/affiliated entities)
− the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
− the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point
4.3).
The financial statements must detail the eligible costs and contributions for each budget category and, for
the final payment, also the revenues for the action (see Articles 6 and 22).
All eligible costs and contributions incurred should be declared, even if they exceed the amounts indicated in
the estimated budget (see Annex 2). Amounts that are not declared in the individual financial statements will
not be taken into account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statements (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the beneficiaries confirm
that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the costs and contributions declared are eligible (see Article 6)
- the costs and contributions can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting documents (see
Article 20) that will be produced upon request (see Article 19) or in the context of checks, reviews,
audits and investigations (see Article 25)
- for the final periodic report: all the revenues have been declared (if required; see Article 22).
Beneficiaries will have to submit also the financial statements of their affiliated entities (if any). In case of
recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the financial statements of their
affiliated entities.
1. Periodic reporting
What? In addition to the continuous reporting and in order to receive payments (any type;
additional pre-financings, interim and final payment), the beneficiaries (and their affiliated
entities) must submit reports for payment to document the technical (and financial)
implementation of the action. This is the periodic reporting.
214EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
These reports must be distinguished from deliverables and milestones (that are part of
Annex 1; see Article 21.1).
How & When? The reports for payment must be submitted through the Portal Periodic
Reporting tool after the end of each reporting period (including the final one; for the
schedule, see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
The coordinator must submit either an additional pre-financing report (for additional pre-
financing payment) or a periodic report (for interim and final payment).
In both cases, this report is composed of two main parts, a technical and a financial part.
The technical part aims at providing an overview of the action implementation and progress
and its content is programme-specific. It usually includes an explanation of work carried out,
overview of progress, publishable summary, key performance indicators, etc (template
available for download directly in the system)
The financial part is filled in directly online and includes:
− for additional pre-financing:
− a statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment (only supporting
document; no other financial information to be filled in)
− for interim and final payments:
− the financial statements (individual and consolidated; for all
beneficiaries/affiliated entities
− the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if
required)
− the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2
and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) (template available for download directly in the
system).
The explanation of the use of resources must be consistent with the costs declared
in the financial statement (for each beneficiary/affiliated entity).
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries must keep adequate records of the documents
submitted for their affiliated entities (e.g. financial statement, CFS, etc; see Article 20).
For additional pre-financings, the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing
serves to curb the paying out of additional pre-financing, if not really needed (— either
because progress of the action is slow or the consumption of the previous pre-financing is
low). The additional pre-financing payment will be reduced, if — according to this statement
— the previous pre-financing was not fully used (see Article 22.3.1). Thus:
− if 70% or more of the previous pre-financing has been used: the additional pre-
financing is paid in full
− if less than 70% of the previous pre-financing has been used: the additional pre-
financing will be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the
percentage actually used and 70%.
For interim or final payments, each beneficiary/affiliated entity must fill out their individual
financial statement (individually), and then signed and formally submitted to the coordinator
(for beneficiaries, directly in the Portal; for affiliated entities, through their beneficiary). This
includes the coordinator, who must also submit the individual financial statement for itself.
215EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The individual financial statements (Annex 4 of the Grant Agreement) must contain all costs
that:
− were incurred by the beneficiary/affiliated entities during the reporting period and
− fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.
Best practice: Beneficiaries/affiliated entities should declare ALL their eligible costs — even if
they are above the estimated budget in Annex 2 (cost overruns). The grant will be capped at
the maximum grant amount in Annex 2, but cost overruns may turn out useful, if the
granting authority should reject some of the costs (at payment or later on).
Beneficiaries/affiliated entities may declare costs incurred during a previous reporting period,
if they were not declared before.
By contrast, once costs have been declared (closed financial statement), they should
normally no longer be changed. If a beneficiary/affiliated entity notices a mistake in a
previous financial statement (e.g. incorrect accounting information; error in the calculation;
etc), they can however make an adjustment (positive or negative) at the next reporting.
Such adjustments can be made to the financial statements for any previous reporting period.
Example: An internal audit by the beneficiary on the annual accounts finds errors in the
accounting information used to calculate the daily rate. The beneficiary can adapt the costs
declared to the EU action at the next reporting.
For affiliated entities, the financial statements must be filled out and submitted by their
beneficiary (since the affiliated entities cannot sign them in the IT system). Before
submission, the beneficiary must complete the data for the affiliated entity (based on the
information it received from the affiliated entity). The affiliated entity must ensure the
accuracy of the encoded information, but the beneficiary is ultimately responsible for
submitting the statement (see Article 21.2).
Best practice: Beneficiaries and their affiliated entities may establish practical information
exchange procedures to ensure and verify the accuracy of the financial statement data to be
submitted. For example, the beneficiary can create a PDF export from the system and send
it to the affiliated entity for confirmation.

General > Article 21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
The financial statements must be drafted in euro.
[OPTION 1 for programmes with double conversion (standard):
Beneficiaries with general accounts established in a currency other than the euro must convert the costs
recorded in their accounts into euro, at the average of the daily exchange rates published in the C series of the
Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website), calculated over the corresponding reporting period.
If no daily euro exchange rate is published in the Official Journal for the currency in question, they must be
converted at the average of the monthly accounting exchange rates published on the European Commission
website (InforEuro), calculated over the corresponding reporting period.
Beneficiaries with general accounts in euro must convert costs incurred in another currency into euro
according to their usual accounting practices.]
[OPTION 6 for programmes with double conversion (EU or Oanda) with average/monthly/daily conversion
rates:
Beneficiaries with general accounts established in a currency other than the euro must convert the costs
recorded in their accounts into euro:
- either at the end of the corresponding reporting period:
- using the average of the daily exchange rates published either by the EU in the C series of
the Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website) or by Oanda over the
corresponding reporting period or
- if no daily euro exchange rate is published for the currency in question, using the average of
the monthly accounting exchange rates published on the European Commission website
(InforEuro) over the corresponding reporting period
- or for each month separately over the corresponding reporting period:
- using the monthly accounting exchange rate published, for that month, on the European
Commission website (InforEuro)
- or for each day separately over the corresponding reporting period:
- using the accounting exchange rate published, for that day, either by the EU in the C series
of the Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website) or by Oanda.
Beneficiaries with general accounts in euro must convert costs incurred in another currency into euro
according to their usual accounting practices.]
1. Currency for financial statements and conversion into euro
Beneficiaries/affiliated entities must report their costs in the financial statements in euros.
The rules on conversion (of costs incurred in other currencies into euros) are as follows:
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities with accounting records in euros: conversion of
costs according to their usual accounting practices
− for beneficiaries/affiliated entities with accounting records in a currency other than the
euro, the rules on conversion of costs recorded in their accounts may be one of the
following:
217EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for programmes with double conversion rule (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2; currently
all programmes):
− using the average, over the corresponding reporting period, of the daily
exchange rates published (most programmes):
− in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union
To calculate this average rate based on the daily exchange rates
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union,
the beneficiaries may use the editable charts on the ECB website.
How to calculate the rate on the ECB website:
Step 1 — Go to the ECB website.
Step 2 — Click on the chart icon [ ] for the currency.
Step 3 — Select the conversion (normally other currency vs. Euro).
Step 4 — Insert the starting date of the reporting period in the field
‘from’ and the end date of the reporting period in the field ‘to’. The
average for the period will appear above the chart.
Note that the ECB has changed their methodology for the displayed
average currency exchange rates (over any given period). Therefore,
average currency conversion rates taken from the ECB website before 13
April 2023 may not correspond to the average for the same period
displayed since April 13. Financial statements based on currency
conversions done with the ECB calculator before 13 April 2023 remain
however fully valid and will be recognised in case of checks, audits,
reviews or investigations. You do not need to make any

corresponding reporting period, using the currency converter on the
Commission website (InforEur).
− using either an average, monthly or daily rate (RELEX):
− for the average rate: calculation using the average over the reporting
period, in accordance with the same rules as above (plus possibility to
use the exchange rate published by Oanda instead of the rate published
by the EU)
− for the monthly rate: calculation for each month separately over the
reporting period, using the monthly accounting exchange rate published,
for each month, on the European Commission website (InforEuro)
− for the daily rate: calculation for each day separately over the reporting
period, using the accounting exchange rate published, for each day
either by the EU on the ECB website or by Oanda.
For cost adjustments to previous periods (‘adjustment financial statements’), the exchange
rate to be used is the one for the reporting period in which the costs adjusted were incurred.
For partial reporting periods (e.g. because a beneficiary joins the grant in the middle of a
reporting period), the exchange rate should be calculated as from the start date of joining the
grant.For eligible costs related to drafting and submitting the final reports incurred after the
action duration, the exchange rate to be used is the one for the last reporting period.

21.4 Reporting language
21.4 Reporting language
The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority
(see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
21.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a report submitted does not comply with this Article, the granting authority may suspend the payment
deadline (see Article 29) and apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the grant or the
coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Language of reports
For most programmes, the reports must be drafted in the language of the Grant
Agreement (indicated at the end of the Grant Agreement, next to the signatures of the
parties), unless the granting authority agreed differently.
For RELEX, the Data Sheet option in the Grant Agreement refers to the language(s) specified
in the call document (and this special language regime is then valid also for project reviews
and audits; see Article 25).

22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) and must be
distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to distribution of the initial pre-financing payment;
see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date when they are debited
to its account.
1. Payments to be made
The granting authority will make payments in accordance with what is set out in the Data
Sheet. This may include the following:
− pre-financing payment(s) at the beginning of the action (to provide beneficiaries
with a cash float to start working on the project).
Pre-financing will NOT be paid before the Grant Agreement is signed (even if the
starting date of the action is before).
− interim payment(s) to cover eligible costs incurred in the reporting periods (as
many interim payments as number of reporting periods, minus one which is the final
payment)
− the final payment (payment of the balance) after the end of the action.
All payments are subject to a payment deadline (i.e. number of days within which the
granting authority has to pay the consortium — after having received the payment request).
The deadline is defined in the Data Sheet.
If there are issues with the payment request or with the costs declared which make it
impossible to continue with the payment, the granting authority will suspend the deadline
(see Article 29). The granting authority can also, in specific circumstances, suspend
payments (see Article 30).
220EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
All payments (pre-financings, interim payments and final payment) may be offset against
debts of any of the beneficiaries towards the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary based on its eligible cost and contributions. If the granting authority is the
Commission or an EU executive agency, the offsetting will also be done for debts towards other
Commission services or executive agencies. This offsetting will be done automatically and is not
subject to the consent of the beneficiary concerned.
Note that in case of early termination of the action, the coordinator should normally not
become responsible for paying back amounts of prefinancing that were never received because
they were offset for the debts of another partner. If this happens, the granting authority may
agree to deviate from the Grant Agreement provisions and re-instate the recovery order towards
the initial debtor. Please contact the EU project officer in charge of your grant.
The payments are made to the coordinator’s bank account as set out in the Grant
Agreement; the beneficiaries are NOT paid individually by the granting authority.
The coordinator must distribute the amounts received to the beneficiaries. However, how and
when the payments are distributed is in principle an internal matter for the consortium.
The consortium agreement (if applicable) may set out, for instance, specific periods
for the distribution of payments or that the distribution will be carried out in
instalments (and these will not be considered ‘unjustified delays’, if the arrangements
set out in the consortium agreement are complied with).
Similarly, the consortium agreement may provide for a distribution of the funding
which is different from the contribution approved by the granting authority for each
beneficiary.
If the coordinator does NOT comply with its payment distribution obligations, this is in
principle an issue to be resolved within the consortium. However, persistent failure to
comply with obligations of the coordinator (such as distribution of payments) may lead
to any of the consequences as provided under the respective measure in Chapter 5.
The granting authority will normally not be informed of the distribution of the payments by
the coordinator, unless:
− if it specifically requests this
− in the event of recovery at the payment of the balance (see Article 22.3.4)
− if the participation of one or more beneficiary is terminated (see Article 22.3.2).

General > Article 22.2 Recoveries
22.2 Recoveries
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it turns out that the
granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts undue.
[OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: The general liability regime for
recoveries (first-line liability) is as follows: At final payment, the coordinator will be fully liable for
recoveries, even if it has not been the final recipient of the undue amounts. At beneficiary termination or after
final payment, recoveries will be made directly against the beneficiaries concerned.
Beneficiaries will be fully liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4):
- the beneficiaries will be jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of another beneficiary under
the Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority (see Data
Sheet, Point 4.4)
- affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of their beneficiaries under the Agreement
(including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
[OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: Each beneficiary’s financial
responsibility in case of recovery is in principle limited to their own debt and undue amounts of their
affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4), affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of
their beneficiaries, if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
1. Recoveries of undue amounts
If it turns out that the granting authority has paid too much — for example due to cost
rejection or grant reduction (in particular, following a check, audit, extension of audit
findings, review or OLAF investigation), it will recover the amount paid in excess.
Recovery normally takes place only at payment of the balance or afterwards. Exceptionally, it
can take place before, if a beneficiary’s participation is terminated.
The detailed calculations for all cases are described in Article 22.3.
2. Financial liability for recoveries
The financial liability for recoveries depends on the programme:
− for programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): the financial liability is as
follows:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation, but not intervene to recover this money (no debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole
amount that needs to be recovered (i.e. paid back to the granting authority)—
even if it has not been the final recipient of the concerned amount (debit note);
if the coordinator does not pay (irrespective of the reason), the granting
authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, drawing on the pre-
222EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
financing guarantee, joint and several liability of other beneficiaries or affiliated
entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see Article 22.4)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): each beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle
limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by their affiliated
entities. It is only for the contribution to the MIM that financial responsibility is
shared:
− at beneficiary termination, the beneficiary concerned must pay back any undue
amounts to the consortium; the granting authority will inform them about this
obligation and, if the beneficiary doesn’t pay, the granting authority may call
on the MIM to intervene and then start a recovery procedure against the
beneficiary for the account of the MIM (debit note)
− at the payment of the balance, the contribution to the MIM will be used to
cover recoveries (if any); if the contribution is not sufficient, the coordinator
will be asked to pay back the amount owed (as representative of the
consortium); if the debt is not paid but the report on the distribution of
payments was provided, the granting authority will calculate the share of the
debt per beneficiary and confirm the amount to be recovered from each of
them separately (debit note); if they do not pay (irrespective of the reason),
the granting authority will enforce recovery (through offsetting, joint and
several liability of affiliated entities, or legal action or enforceable decision; see
Article 22.4); if the report on the distribution of payments was NOT provided,
the granting authority will enforce recovery against the coordinator (debit
note); if needed, the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and
will then continue recovery for the account of the MIM (second debit note
replacing the first)
− after payment of the balance, recoveries (if any) will be made directly against
the beneficiary concerned (debit note); no MIM intervention (new for 2021-
2027).
In addition, beneficiaries are always liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities
AND there may be specific joint and several liability regimes in case of enforced recoveries
(depending on the type of programme and Grant Agreement; see Article 22.4).
2.1Programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries, the granting authority will
recover the undue amounts:
from the coordinator if the recovery is at the final payment
from the beneficiary who owes the money (including undue amounts paid for costs declared
by its affiliated entities, if any) if the recovery is at beneficiary termination or after the final
payment.
In case of enforced recovery, i.e. when the coordinator/beneficiary does not pay the amount
owed, if the corresponding option has been activated (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4), the
granting authority may hold the beneficiaries jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of
another beneficiary under the Agreement (including late-payment interest)
recover also from the affiliated entities. The affiliated entity’s financial responsibility (for the
debt towards the granting authority) is limited to its maximum grant amount in Annex 2.For
more information on enforced recoveries see Article 22.4.
2.2. Programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries he granting authority will
recover the undue amounts from the beneficiary that owes the money (including undue
amounts paid for costs declared by its affiliated entities, if any).
223EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In case of recovery, each beneficiary’s financial responsibility is normally limited to its own
debt (which includes undue amounts paid for costs declared by its affiliated entities, if any).
If the granting authority has requested joint and several liability of an affiliated entity, it may
recover also from the affiliated entity in case of enforced recovery. The affiliated entity’s
financial responsibility (for the debt towards the granting authority) is limited to its maximum
grant amount in Annex 2.
For more information on enforced recoveries see Article 22.4.
3. Procedure
The basic procedure for recovery is almost always the same: After a contradictory
procedure, the granting authority claims repayment of the amounts and, if not paid, then
enforces recovery (see Article 22.4).
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention to recover (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms the amount to be recovered, and issues a debit note.
Specific cases:
Recoveries for beneficiary in insolvency/bankruptcy — If a beneficiary is in
insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings, the granting authority may have to act quickly in order
to submit its claims in accordance with the deadlines under the national
insolvency/bankruptcy procedures. If immediate action is needed, it will make a provisional
declaration and then complete the contradictory procedure with the beneficiary (and, if
needed, adjust or cancel the provisional declaration).

22.3.1 Pre-financing payments
22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Pre-financing payments
The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial pre-financings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2).
For additional pre-financings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment shows that
less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the
70% threshold and the amount used.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The contribution to the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism will be retained from the pre-financing payments (at the rate and in accordance with
the modalities set out in the Data Sheet, see Point 4.2) and transferred to the Mechanism.]
Pre-financing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts
owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
1. Pre-financing payments
Most programmes foresee the payment of pre-financing, in order to give beneficiaries a
sufficient float to start working on the action.
All pre-financing funds remain EU property until they are cleared against eligible
costs or contributions accepted by the granting authority (normally at final payment). The
pre-financing is therefore an advance payment. It will only become the property of the
beneficiaries when the granting authority approves the corresponding EU funding based on
eligible costs or contributions.
If this option is activated in the Grant Agreement, the initial pre-financing payment is
automatically paid after grant signature. The consortium does NOT need to submit a request
of payment to get it.
For additional pre-financings (if any), the consortium will be prompted to submit an
additional pre-financing report (which includes a statement on the use of the previous pre-
financing payment; see Article 21.2).
The ‘use’ of pre-financing does not necessarily correspond to incurring actual cost. Pre-
financing can be considered already used if in accordance with the usual accounting practice
of the beneficiary a corresponding amount has been committed (e.g. on subcontracts or
financial support to third parties (FSTP)) for the implementation of the action and cannot be
used for other commitments anymore.
225EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The additional pre-financing payment will be reduced if — according to the statement on use
of the previous pre-financing payment — less than 70% of the previous pre-financing was
used. In that case, the amount of the additional pre-financing set out in the Data Sheet will
be reduced by the difference between 70% of the previous pre-financing and the amount
actually used.
Example: The Data Sheet indicates that there will be an initial pre-financing of EUR 100 000
and one additional pre-financing of EUR 50 000. The consortium reports in the statement of the
use of previous pre-financing payment that only EUR 65 000 have been used so far. The
additional pre-financing payment will be:
{50 000 – ((100 000 x 0.7) – 65 000)} = 45 000
Pre-financing amount:
The amount of the initial and additional pre-financings (if any) are fixed by the granting
authority before grant signature (calculation usually based on a percentage of the maximum
grant amount in Annex 2). It will be lowered for additional pre-financings if the beneficiaries
used less than 70% of the previous pre-financing. The granting authority will inform the
coordinator about the amount paid in the pre-financing payment letter.
Specific cases (pre-financing payments):
Contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM) (HE only) — For programmes
with MIM, the contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism will be automatically deducted
from the initial pre-financing payment and transferred to the MIM (and then released at the
end of the action; see the specific cases on final payment in Article 22.3.4).
Example: For a grant with a maximum amount of EUR 1 000 000 and a 40% pre-financing rate,
EUR 50 000 (5% of the maximum grant amount) will be retained from the EUR 400 000 pre-
financing, resulting in a payment of EUR 350 000 to the coordinator.
Financial support to third parties (FSTP) — Where an action includes financial support to
third parties (e.g. in the form of grants), the commitments entered into by the beneficiaries
vis-à-vis their third parties receiving financial support can be included in the ‘additional pre-
financing report’ for the purpose of calculating the 70% usage threshold, even if no payments
have been made — provided it is the usual accounting practice of the beneficiaries to
consider the corresponding amounts as committed/used and thus no longer available for
other purposes.

General > Article 22.3.2 Beneficiary termination
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
In case of beneficiary termination, the granting authority will determine the provisional amount due for the
beneficiary concerned. Payments (if any) will be made with the next interim or final payment.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary for all reporting
periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the accepted
costs of the beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold
cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum
contributions and financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting amount is the
‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the distribution of
payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments received (if any)}.
If the balance is positive, the amount will be included in the next interim or final payment to the consortium.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be recovered and the
reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the
observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this amount to be paid to the
coordinator (confirmation letter).
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If payment is not made to the
coordinator by the date specified in the confirmation letter, the granting authority may call on the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism to intervene, if continuation of the action is guaranteed and the conditions set out in
the rules governing the Mechanism are met.
In this case, it will send a beneficiary recovery letter, together with a debit note with the terms and date for
payment.
The debit note for the beneficiary will include the amount calculated for the affiliated entities which also had
to end their participation (if any).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.]
The amounts will later on also be taken into account for the next interim or final payment.
227EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recoveries?
If a beneficiary is terminated and leaves the consortium, the granting authority must
provisionally close the accounts for that beneficiary.
The amount due at beneficiary termination will be calculated on the basis of the termination
report, the EU contribution already approved and the report on the distribution of payments
(see also Article 32). It will be equal to the accepted EU contribution minus payments
received by the beneficiary (pre-financing(s) and interim payments; if any).
If the terminated beneficiary is audited later on, but while the project is still ongoing, its
amount due will be re-calculated to determine the amount to recover. If the terminated
beneficiary is audited after the end of the project, the recovery will follow the standard rules
(revised final grant amount calculated).
2. Amount due
The amount due at beneficiary termination is the part of the grant which the beneficiary is
entitled to keep when they leave the project.
Calculation of the amount due at beneficiary termination:
Step 1 — Calculation of the accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
concerned, the granting authority will add the two following:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted costs for the beneficiary (i.e. costs declared in the interim and
termination reports and accepted by the granting authority; see Articles 6 and
27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount for
the beneficiary.
Depending on whether termination is initiated by the beneficiaries or the
granting authority, only costs incurred (see Article 6.1(a)) until end-of-work
date or date of which termination takes effect are eligible (except for costs for
the termination report). Costs relating to contracts due for execution (i.e.
delivery) after end-of-work/termination are NOT eligible (except for pillar-
assessed participants, see Article 10.3).
If the beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, the accepted EU contribution will
be this lower requested amount.
If the beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS,
see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the termination report
but fails to do so, the maximum EU contribution will be capped at the CFS
threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for
costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU contribution
to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the CFS, the maximum EU
contribution to costs will be capped at EUR 429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 60 days of the
date on which termination takes effect), costs and contribution that were not included in an
approved periodic financial report will NOT be taken into account for the calculation of the
accepted EU contribution. The granting authority will NOT send a written reminder and will
not extend the deadline.
228EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article
28), for example if the beneficiary has committed a serious breach of obligations
under the Grant Agreement, the EU contribution will be reduced (decreased)
accordingly. The final result will be the total accepted EU contribution for the
beneficiary.
Balance (amount to be paid or recovered):
The balance (amount to be paid or recovered) will be equal to the accepted EU contribution
minus payments received by the beneficiary (pre-financing(s) and interim payments; if any).
The amount of pre-financing(s) and interim payments received must be communicated to the
granting authority by the coordinator via the report on distribution of payments that must be
submitted as part of the termination (see Article 32.2.2). If the coordinator does not submit
the report on the distribution of payments, the terminated beneficiary will NOT have to repay
any amounts to the consortium.
If the amount due is positive (more accepted EU contribution than payments made), the
granting authority will include the difference in the next interim/final payment to the
consortium.
If the amount due is negative (less accepted EU contribution than payments made), the
beneficiary must pay back the difference, i.e. the money it received in excess, to the
consortium.
Example for calculating the amount due at beneficiary termination:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100 %. No contributions.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Accepted EU contribution: Beneficiary A goes bankrupt in the middle of the action and is terminated
at month 18 (of 36), just before the end of RP1.
Costs declared by beneficiary A in the termination report = EUR 62 500.
Costs rejected for beneficiary A following audit = EUR 12 500.
Accepted costs beneficiary A: EUR 62 500 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 50 000.
Application of funding rate: EUR 50 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Beneficiary balance: Payments received by beneficiary A (according to the report on the distribution
of payments): EUR 60 000.
Beneficiary A balance = EUR 50 000 (accepted EU contribution) – EUR 60 000 (payments received)
= EUR -10 000 (excess payments of EUR 10 000).
Recovery: Amount to be recovered from beneficiary A: EUR 10 000 (negative balance of EUR 10 000
must be returned to the consortium).
3. Procedure
I granting authority will inform the beneficiary concerned about the termination calculations
and give them the opportunity to provide observations (beneficiary termination calculation
letter and final letter).
If the balance is negative, a mechanism is needed to recover this amount and ensure that it
is paid back to the consortium (who will need the missing float to successfully complete the
project). The procedure depends on the type of programme (with or without MIM):
For programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE), the granting authority will
inform the beneficiary concerned about the amount that needs to be returned to the
consortium (and the obligation to do so). For the rest, this will however be treated as a
229EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
matter for the consortium to deal with, and the granting authority will therefore not intervene
any further.
For programmes with MIM (HE only), the granting authority will make sure that the
amount in question is recovered from the beneficiary concerned and injected back into the
consortium (debit note issued by the EU). If the beneficiary doesn’t honour the debit note,
the granting authority may call on the MIM to intervene and then recover the amount for the
MIM (if needed by enforcing the recovery, using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4).

General > Article 22.3.3 Interim payments
22.3.3 Interim payments
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible costs and contributions claimed for the implementation of the action
during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out the Data Sheet
(see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the reporting period, by
first calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the accepted costs of
each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold cappings
(if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and
financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary termination (if any).
The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
[OPTION for programmes with early pre-financing clearing (before reaching the interim payment ceiling):
If pre-financing clearing before reaching the interim payment ceiling is provided for in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2), the total accepted EU contribution will be lowered to clear the amount of pre-financing payments
previously made.]
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of pre-financing and interim payments (if
any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts owed
by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
1. Interim payments
During the project, the granting authority will make interim payments, if this option is
activated in the Grant Agreement.
The amount of the interim payments will be calculated on the basis of the costs and
contributions reported in the financial statements and the (previous pre-financing and/or
interim) payments already made.
Cost and contributions accepted in a periodic report may still be rejected later if a check,
review, audit or investigation finds out that they were not eligible.
231EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Calculation of interim payments:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution for the action for the
reporting period concerned, the granting authority will add the two following:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted costs reported in the financial statements (see Articles 6 and 27) by
the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount for the
consortium.
The following amounts will flow into the calculation of the maximum EU
contribution to costs for the interim payment to the consortium:
− If a beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, its accepted EU
contribution will be this lower requested amount.
− If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS, see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the
periodic report but fails to do so, its maximum EU contribution will be
capped at the CFS threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU
funding for costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the
requested EU contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not
submit the CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be capped at EUR
429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If during the reporting period the participation of a beneficiary was terminated and if a
grant reduction was applied to the terminated beneficiary, the amount of that grant
reduction will reduce the accepted EU contribution.
Step 2 — Capping the amount at the interim payments ceiling
If the total accepted EU contribution is more than the ceiling set out in the Data Sheet
(Point 4.2) minus the pre-financing(s) and previous interim payments, the payment
will be capped at that limit. The pre-financing clearing is automatically recorded with
costs above the interim payment threshold (normally 90%).
Examples for calculating interim payments:
Case 1:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 1 000 000 and 100% funding rate. No contributions.
Pre-financing of EUR 333 334.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 1 000 000 = EUR 900 000
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by the consortium for RP1: EUR 625 000.
After checking the reports EUR 25 000 claimed by beneficiary A and EUR 15 000 claimed by
beneficiary B are considered not eligible. The granting authority therefore rejects EUR 40 000.
Total accepted costs RP1: EUR 585 000.
Application of funding rate: 100% = EUR 585 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing = EUR 900 000 – EUR 333 334
[pre-financing payment] = EUR 566 666.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 566 666 [EUR 585 000
accepted contribution capped by the interim payment ceiling of EUR 900 000 minus pre-financing of
EUR 333 334].
232EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The difference between 566 666 and 585 000 will be cleared from the pre-financing.
Interim payment RP 2:
Total accepted costs RP2: EUR 162 500.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0 (the 90% ceiling of EUR
900 000 has already been reached after RP1: EUR 333 334 [pre-financing payment]+ EUR 566 666
[RP1 interim payment]).
The accepted cost will be used to further clear the pre-financing.
Case 2 (grant with terminated beneficiary):
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100%. No contributions.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 500 000 = EUR 450 000.
Beneficiary A was terminated before the end of RP1 and the amount due was its accepted costs :EUR 62
500 EUR (no grant reductions applied).
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by beneficiary A: EUR 62 500.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1: EUR 143 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1: EUR 112 500.
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 62 500 + EUR 143 750 + EUR 112 500 = EUR 318 750.
Some costs declared by beneficiary B are rejected for an amount of EUR 12 500. Total accepted costs
RP 1: EUR 318 750 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 306 250.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 306 250 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing = EUR 450 000 [ceiling] – EUR
200 000 [pre-financing payment] = EUR 250 000.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250 000 [EUR 306 250
accepted contribution capped by the interim payment ceiling of EUR 450 000 minus pre-financing of
EUR 333 334].
Case 3:
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three reporting periods.
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200
000; B= EUR 200 000; C= EUR 100 000).
Funding rate: 100%.
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.
Interim payment ceiling: 90% of the maximum grant amount of EUR 500 000 = EUR 450 000.
Interim payment RP1:
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP1: EUR 118 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1: EUR 143 750.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1: EUR 112 500.
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 118 750 + EUR 143 750 + EUR 112 500 = EUR 375 000.
Some direct costs declared by beneficiary A are rejected for an amount of EUR 12 500.
Total accepted costs RP 1: EUR 375 000 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 362 500.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 362 500 (total accepted EU contribution).
Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing: EUR 450 000 – EUR 200 000 = EUR
250 000.
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250 000.
Interim payment RP2:
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP2: EUR 25 000.
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP2: EUR 37 500.
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP2: EUR 37 500.
Total costs declared RP2: EUR 25 000 + EUR 37 500 + EUR 37 500 = EUR 100 000.
Costs rejected for beneficiary B at RP2: EUR 12 500.
Costs rejected for beneficiary C at RP2: EUR 6 250.
233EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Total accepted costs RP2 = EUR 81 250.
Application of the funding rate 100%: EUR 81 250 (total accepted EU contribution).
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0 (the 90% limit has already
been reached in RP1: EUR 200 000 + EUR 250 000 = EUR 450 000).
2. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the coordinator about the interim payment calculations and
give them the possibility to submit observations (payment letter and final letter).
234EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 22.3.4 Final payment
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the remaining part of the eligible costs and
contributions claimed for the implementation of the action(if any).
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see
Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all reporting
periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the funding rate to the total
accepted costs of each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower contribution to costs, CFS
threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump
sum contributions and financing not linked to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting amount is the
‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
If the resulting amount is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.2, it will be limited to
the latter.
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
If the no-profit rule is provided for in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2), the grant must not produce a profit (i.e.
surplus of the amount obtained following Step 2 plus the action’s revenues, over the eligible costs and
contributions approved by the granting authority).
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4), for beneficiaries that are
profit legal entities [OPTION for programmes with exception for revenues: [OPTION if selected for the call:
(— with the exception of [insert exceptions], which are not considered as revenues)]].
If there is a profit, it will be deducted in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of the eligible costs
approved by the granting authority (as compared to the amount calculated following Steps 1 and 2 minus the
contributions).
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of pre-financing and interim
payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{final grant amount
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments made (if any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The amount retained for the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism (see above) will be released and paid to the coordinator (in accordance with the rules
governing the Mechanism).]
235EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against amounts owed by
a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency, offsetting
may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30).
If [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): — despite the release of the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism contribution —] the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be recovered and
the reasons why
- [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): requesting a report on the
distribution of payments to the beneficiaries within 30 days of receiving notification and]
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
[OPTION 1 for programmes without Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations are submitted
(or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has received), it will confirm
the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with a debit note with the terms and date for
payment.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations are submitted (or
the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has received) and the coordinator
has submitted the report on the distribution of payments, it will calculate the share of the debt per
beneficiary, by:
(a) identifying the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:
{{{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action},
minus
{pre-financing and interim payments received by the beneficiary (if any)}}
and
(b) dividing the debt:
{{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned
divided by
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to point (a)}
multiplied by
the amount to be recovered}.
and confirm the amount to be recovered from each beneficiary concerned (confirmation letter), together
with debit notes with the terms and date for payment.
The debit notes for beneficiaries will include the amounts calculated for their affiliated entities (if any).
If the coordinator has not submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the granting authority will
recover the full amount from the coordinator (confirmation letter and debit note with the terms and date
for payment).]
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.
236EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Final payment — Recoveries?
At the final payment (payment of the balance), the granting authority must close the
accounts for the action.
The final payment amount (to be paid or recovered) will be calculated on the basis of the
costs and contributions reported in the financial statements and the payments already made.
Cost and contributions accepted in a periodic report may still be rejected later if a
check, review, audit or investigation finds out that they were not eligible.
2. Final grant amount
The final grant amount is the total EU contribution to which the consortium as a whole is
entitled to at the end of the action. It can never be higher than the maximum grant amount
in Annex 2, but it can be lower if there are insufficient total accepted eligible costs and
contributions or if the granting authority applies a grant reduction (see Article 28).
The final grant amount will depend on two types of criteria:
− implementation criteria, i.e. was the action implemented as described in Annex 1
and in accordance with the obligations set out in the Grant Agreement.
This is mostly a technical analysis by the granting authority of the work performed
during the action, as compared with the activities set out in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. If the action was not properly implemented, the granting authority may
decide to reduce the grant (see Article 28).
− financial criteria, including:
− the amount of (accepted) eligible costs and contributions
− the funding rate(s)
− the maximum grant amount (Annex 2)
− the profit.
Calculation of the final grant amount:
Step 1 — Total accepted EU contribution
In order to calculate the total accepted EU contribution for the action, the granting
authority will determine the following elements:
− maximum EU contribution to costs, which is the result of multiplying the
accepted eligible costs reported in the financial statements (see Articles 6
and 27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and sum them up to a total amount
for the consortium.
− If a beneficiary requested less EU contribution than the maximum EU
contribution resulting from its eligible costs, its accepted EU
contribution will be this lower requested amount.
− If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS, see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) with the
periodic report but fails to do so, its maximum EU contribution will be
capped at the CFS threshold stated in the Data Sheet minus one euro.
237EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: The beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for
costs. According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU
contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the
CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be capped at EUR 429 999.
− accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-rate or
lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs.
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article
28), for example due to improper implementation of the action, the EU contribution
will be reduced (decreased) accordingly. The final result will be the total accepted
EU contribution.
Step 2 — Limit to maximum grant amount
If the total accepted EU contribution is higher than the maximum grant amount for the
action in Annex 2, it will be capped at the maximum grant amount.
Step 3 — No-profit rule (if applicable; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2)
For entities that work for profit (in their usual activities), EU grants must not have the
purpose or effect of producing a profit during the action. Beneficiaries that are profit
legal entities (and that do not fall under any of the other exceptions, see below) must
therefore declare their revenues at the end of the action.
For the calculation of the profit, only the EU grant (and other EU grants, if any; see
Article 6.3) and the revenues from the action (e.g. from the sale of results, such as
products, services and publications, conference fees) are taken into account. Grants from
other donors for the action or for the activities of the beneficiaries (‘financial
contributions’) are NOT considered as revenue.
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4),
for beneficiaries that are profit legal entities. The revenue must be:
− established (i.e. revenue that has been collected AND entered in the accounts)
− generated (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but which has been
generated)
or
− confirmed (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but for which the
beneficiary has a commitment or written confirmation).
Exceptions: Only for-profit entities must declare revenues. In addition, certain types
of grants are exempted:
− actions with the objective to reinforce the financial capacity of the beneficiaries
(— this should be clear from the call)
− actions where the continuity after their end is to be ensured by the income
generated by the action (— this should be clear from the call)
− grants in the form of study, research or training scholarships paid to natural
persons or as other forms of direct support paid to natural persons who are
most in need (e.g. refugees, the unemployed)
− grants with a maximum amount of not more than EUR 60 000 (low value
grants)
Profit calculation and deduction: The declared revenues will be taken into account
by the system and the profit (if any) will be deducted from the amount resulting from
238EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of eligible costs (i.e. not the
entire profit is deducted, only an amount proportionate to the EU share of funding the
action):
{profit}
multiplied by
{final rate of reimbursement of the eligible costs}
The profit is calculated as follows:
{((amount after step 2 [the lower of total accepted EU contribution or maximum grant
amount]) plus action revenue) minus accepted eligible costs}
The final rate of reimbursement is distinct from the funding rate. It is the
proportion of EU funding, i.e. the eligible cost of the action compared to the final
grant amount. It is calculated as follows:
{(Amount after step 2 [the lower of total accepted EU contribution or maximum grant
amount]) divided by accepted eligible cost}
Balance — Payment or recovery:
The balance (amount to be paid or recovered) will be equal to the final grant amount minus
the payments already made to the consortium (pre-financing(s) and interim payments).
If the resulting amount is positive (final grant amount higher than payments made), the
granting authority will pay the difference as final payment.
If the resulting amount is negative (final grant amount lower than payments made), the
final payment will take the form of a recovery (the consortium will have to pay back the EU
contribution received in excess).
Example for calculating the final grant amount:
At the end of an action with a maximum grant amount of EUR 1 million and a funding rate of 70% the
beneficiary, a private IT-startup, submits the last periodic report for the final payment. The beneficiary
has declared eligible cost of EUR 1,7 million during all reporting periods. The financial statements of the
beneficiary show that profit was generated due to a ministry of a Member State procuring for EUR 800
000 a licence for the use of an IT tool developed under one of the work packages during the last
reporting period of the action. The grant does not provide for a specific exemption from the no-profit
rule.
Relevant data (see Data Sheet):
Exempted: No (no specific exemption under the grant, and no general exemption as the IT-startup is
a for-profit entity)
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 1 000 000
Funding rate: 70%
Accepted eligible cost: EUR 1 700 000
Revenue: EUR 800 000
Step 1 – Total accepted EU contribution: With a funding rate of 70% applied to the accepted
eligible cost of EUR 1 700 000, the maximum EU contribution to costs would be
EUR 1 700 000 x 0.7 = EUR 1 190 000.
Step 2 – Limit to maximum grant amount: However, the accepted EU contribution of EUR 1 190
000 amount is capped by the maximum grant amount to EUR 1 000 000.
Step 3 – No–Profit: The profit would be EUR 1 000 000 [EU grant from step 2 amount] + EUR 800
000 [revenue] – EUR 1 700 000 [accepted eligible cost] = EUR 100 000
The amount to be deducted would be the profit multiplied by the final rate of reimbursement:
EUR 100 000 [profit] x (EUR 1 000 000 [step 2 amount] / EUR 1 700 000 [accepted eligible cost]).
That is EUR 100 000 [profit] x 58,82% [final rate of reimbursement] = EUR 58 820
Final grant amount = EUR 1 000 000 [step 2 amount] – EUR 58 820 [profit deduction] = EUR 941

239EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Specific cases (final payment):
Combining EU Synergy actions — If the same action received more than one source of EU
funding (only allowed for actions flagged as ‘Synergy action’, see Data Sheet, Point 1), at
final payment it needs to be ensured that the combined actual funding rates do not go
beyond 100% of the accepted eligible cost of the action and the total EU funding (of all EU
grants combined) will accordingly be taken into account for the calculation of revenue.
Income from exploitation of results (HE only) — For actions under Horizon Europe,
income generated by the exploitation of results are NOT considered as revenues. Exploitation
is defined in Annex 5 (e.g. commercialising a product or service).
Income from building up of reserves (operating grants in all programmes) — For
operating grants, amounts which are dedicated to the building up of reserves are NOT
considered as revenues.
Release of the contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM) (HE only) —
For programmes with MIM, the contribution to the MIM that was kept from the pre-financing
(see the specific cases on pre-financing in Article 22.3.1) must be released back to the
consortium.
If the balance is positive, the contribution will be released in a separate payment.
If the balance is negative, the amount to be recovered (debt) will be first compensated
against the MIM contribution released. If this amount is enough to cover the debt, the
recovery process ends here (the consortium will be paid out the remainder of the MIM
contribution, if any is left after the compensation). If the released contribution is not
sufficient to cover the debt, the rest will be recovered (see procedure below).
3. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the consortium about the final payment calculations and
give them the opportunity to provide observations (payment letter and final letter).
If the balance is negative, the amount needs to be recovered. The procedure depends on the
type of programme (with or without MIM).
For programmes without MIM (all programmes except HE): At the payment of the
balance, the coordinator is fully liable for the whole amount that needs to be recovered (i.e.
paid back to the granting authority) — even if it has not been the final recipient of the
concerned amount.
Therefore, the coordinator will receive the final letter with a debit note for the full amount of
the debt of the consortium, with the instructions for payment. If the coordinator does not pay
the debt, the granting authority will enforce the recovery using the mechanisms set out in
Article 22.4.
For programmes with MIM (HE only):
The coordinator is not fully liable for the whole amount that needs to be recovered; each
beneficiary’s financial liability is in principle limited to their own debt and undue amounts paid
for costs declared by their affiliated entities.
Therefore, the coordinator will receive a request to submit the report on the distribution of
payments (in the payment letter) and the negative balance (debt) will be split among the
beneficiaries that received more money than their share in the final grant amount (payments
in excess; based on their eligible costs and contributions). Each beneficiary’s share in the
debt is calculated using the formula:
{((total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary)
divided by
240EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
total accepted EU contribution for the action)
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action}
The negative balance will be then divided among those beneficiaries who received payments
in excess, in proportion to their relative share of the total payments in excess. Each of those
beneficiaries will receive a separate debit note for their share of the debt, with the
instructions for payment (beneficiary recovery letter).
For each beneficiary that does not pay their debt, the granting authority will enforce the
recovery using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4.
Beneficiaries who did not receive more money than their share of the final grant amount will
thus not have to contribute to the repayment of the negative balance. Similarly, the
coordinator is only liable for the full amount of the debt, if they did not submit the report on
the distribution of payments (only in this case will they receive a debit note for the full
amount).
Example (negative balance with MIM):
Grant with four beneficiaries: A, B, C, D.
Maximum grant amount in Annex 2: EUR 3 000 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts: A= EUR
800 000; B= EUR 1 200 000; C= EUR 600 000; D= EUR 400 000).
Funding rate: 100 %.
MIM contribution: 5% of 3 000 000 = EUR 150 000.
Payments received: EUR 2 700 000 (EUR 150 000 retained for the MIM).
Final grant amount:
Total accepted costs: EUR 3 080 000.
Application of the funding rate: 100% = EUR 3 430 000 (total accepted EU contribution).
Grant reduction of EUR 400 000
Accepted EU contribution: 3 080 0–0 - 400 000 = EUR 2 680 000.
Limit to maximum grant amount: not applicable (because maximum grant amount > accepted EU
contribution)
No receipts/profit.
Final grant amount: EUR 2 680 000
Balance & MIM release:
Payments made: EUR 2 700 000.
Balance: EUR 2 680 000 (final grant amoun–) - EUR 2 700 000 (payments made) = EUR -20 000 (excess
payments of EUR 20 000).
Compensating against MIM and release: EUR 150 000 – 20 000 = EUR 130 000.

General > Article 22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount — Recovery
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount — Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see Article 25) —
the granting authority rejects costs or contributions (see Article 27) or reduces the grant (see Article 28), it
will calculate the revised final grant amount for the beneficiary concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary, by
calculating the ‘revised accepted costs’ and ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total accepted EU
contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its share in the final
grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is calculated as
follows:
{{{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the action}.
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the
observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with
a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will enforce recovery in
accordance with Article 22.4.
1. Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery?
If there is an audit (or similar, such as for instance an OLAF investigation) after the end of
the action which finds ineligible costs or contributions (or breaches that require a grant
reduction), the granting authority will have to recalculate the grant for the beneficiary
concerned.
The amount to be recovered after the final payment will be calculated by comparing the
beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount (i.e. at the final payment of the grant) and the
beneficiary’s revised final grant amount (i.e. amount entitled to after the audit).

In order to calculate the amount of revised accepted EU contribution for the
beneficiary concerned, the granting authority will consider the:
− maximum revised EU contribution to costs, which is the result of
multiplying the accepted costs for the beneficiary, after implementation of the
adjustments (see Articles 6, 25 and 27) by the applicable funding rate(s) and
sum them up to a total amount for the beneficiary.
− revised accepted contributions (if any), resulting from accepted unit, flat-
rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked to costs after the
adjustments.
If the granting authority has decided to apply a reduction of the grant (see Article 28),
for example if the audit finds irregularities in the action implementation by the
beneficiary, the revised accepted EU contribution will be reduced (decreased)
accordingly. The final result will be the revised total accepted EU contribution for
the beneficiary.
Amount to be recovered:
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e.
its share in the final grant amount for the action), there will need to be a recovery of the
difference.
The beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount (what the beneficiary was entitled to, based
on its eligible costs and contributions, when the final payment was done) is:
{((total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary) divided by (total accepted EU contribution for
the action)) multiplied by final grant amount for the action}
The beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount is not necessarily equal to the money it
received from the coordinator. The consortium may have decided on a different distribution of
the EU funding. However, the amount to be recovered will be calculated using the
beneficiary’s notional share irrespectively of the amount it actually received from the
coordinator.
The amount to be recovered from the beneficiary will be:
{the beneficiary’s share in the final grant amount}
minus
{the beneficiary’s revised final grant amount}
2. Procedure
The granting authority will inform the beneficiary concerned about the audit implementation
calculations and give them the opportunity to provide observations (audit implementation
pre-information letter and final letter).
For the recovery process, see Article 22.2. If the beneficiary does not pay the debt, the
granting authority will enforce the recovery using the mechanisms set out in Article 22.4.

General > Article 22.4 Enforced recoveries
22.4 Enforced recoveries
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts
owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may be offset
before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive agency,
debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) [OPTION 1 for programmes with pre-financing guarantees: by drawing on the financial
guarantee(s) (if any)][OPTION 2 for programmes without pre-financing guarantees: financial
guarantee(s): not applicable]
(c) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: by holding other
beneficiaries jointly and severally liable (if any; see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)] [OPTION 2 for
programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: joint and several liability of
beneficiaries: not applicable]
(d) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of affiliated entities: by holding
affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)][OPTION 2 for
programmes without joint and several liability of affiliated entities: joint and several liability of
affiliated entities: not applicable] or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that the granting authority is the European
Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable decision under Article 299 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation
2024/2509.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If the Mutual Insurance Mechanism
was called on by the granting authority to intervene, recovery will be continued in the name of the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism. If two debit notes were sent, the second one (in the name of the Mutual Insurance
Mechanism) will be considered to replace the first one (in the name of the granting authority). Where the
MIM intervened, offsetting, enforceable decisions or any other of the above-mentioned forms of enforced
recovery may be used mutatis mutandis.]
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 22.5,
from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the full payment is
received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against
the principal.
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless Directive 2015/236642
applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by offsetting or
enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission (see also Article 43).

244EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Enforced recoveries
If the coordinator/beneficiary concerned does not pay a debit note by the specified deadline,
the granting authority will recover the amount (with interest at the rate set out in Article
22.5), in one of the following ways:
− by offsetting it
− for programmes with pre-financing guarantees (most programmes, except HE): by
drawing on the financial guarantee(s) (if any)
− for programmes with MIM (HE only): by drawing on the Mutual Insurance
Mechanism (MIM), and then follow up with a debit note on behalf of the MIM against
the debtor (and continue the recovery procedure applying any of the other measures
to enforce the recovery)
− if the granting authority has requested joint and several liability: by calling upon
the beneficiary(ies) or affiliated entities concerned (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
or
− by either:
− taking legal action in a national court or the European Court of Justice (see
Article 43) or
− adopting a decision that is enforceable within the meaning of Article 299
TFEU38.39
‘Offsetting’ allows to directly deduct the amount owed by the coordinator/beneficiary from
any other amount that the granting authority owes to the coordinator/beneficiary. With the
offsetting, both amounts are considered paid.
Offsetting is normally implemented as a public law measure (i.e. directly on the
basis of Article 102 of the Financial Regulation 2024/2509). Therefore, the dispute
settlement normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU action; see Article
43.2).
For the cases not covered by the Financial Regulation, offsetting will however —
exceptionally — be implemented as a purely contractual measure (e.g. offsetting against
international organisations). In this case, the normal contractual means for dispute
settlement apply (i.e. Article 272 TFEU action, arbitration, etc; see Article 43.2).
Normally, offsetting is carried out after the deadline specified in the debit note has expired.
However, in exceptional circumstances, the granting authority may offset before this date in
38 See Article 299 TFEU: “Acts of the Council, the Commission or the European Central Bank which impose a
pecuniary obligation on persons other than States, shall be enforceable. Enforcement shall be governed by the
rules of civil procedure in force in the State in the territory of which it is carried out. The order for its
enforcement shall be appended to the decision, without other formality than verification of the authenticity of
the decision, by the national authority which the government of each Member State shall designate for this
purpose and shall make known to the Commission and to the Court of Justice of the European Union. When
these formalities have been completed on application by the party concerned, the latter may proceed to
enforcement in accordance with the national law, by bringing the matter directly before the competent authority.
Enforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court. However, the courts of the country concerned
shall have jurisdiction over complaints that enforcement is being carried out in an irregular manner.”
39 See Article 100(2) Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 100(2) Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
245EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
order to safeguard the EU financial interests (see Article 102(1) Financial Regulation
2024/250940).
If the offsetting takes place after the deadline for payment has expired, the interest must
also be offset. The interest is normally offset first, before the principal amount.
‘Drawing on the MIM’ is available only for programmes with MIM (HE only). For 2021-2027,
MIM interventions are limited to defaults in the context of beneficiary terminations and
negative payment of the balance (see Articles 22.3.2 and 22.3.4); the MIM can no longer be
called on to intervene after the payment of the balance (see Article 22.3.5).
‘Joint and several liability’ means to hold another participant liable for paying the debit note.
There are two types of joint and several liability:
− joint and several liabilities of beneficiaries (only for programmes without MIM; all
programmes except HE) — ONLY if selected by the granting authority during grant
preparation; check the Data Sheet
− joint and several liability of affiliated entities (all programmes) — ONLY if selected by
the granting authority during grant preparation; check the Data Sheet
These joint and several liability regimes are subject to ceilings. Affiliated entities are
generally only liable up to their maximum grant amount in Annex 2. This is also the default
option for beneficiaries (‘limited liability’), but for them the granting authority may also select
another option (either up to the maximum grant amount for the action (‘unconditional
liability’) or no joint and several liability (‘individual liability’)).
‘Enforceable decisions’ are public law decisions, taken directly on the basis of Article 100(2)
of the Financial Regulation 2024/250941. The decision will contain a summary of the claim,
state that the debtor has not paid its debt (despite having been sent a debit note and several
reminders) and indicate the amount of the debt. The decision — duly endorsed with the order
for enforcement issued by the competent authority in the Member State concerned — allows
to have the debtor’s assets seized. Since they are public law decisions, the dispute
settlement normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU action; see Article
43.2).
Specific case (recoveries):
International organisations (IOs) — Enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU (and
other public law decisions) will NOT be taken against international organisations where this
would be contrary to the privileges and immunities accorded by their constituent documents
or international law (see Article 10.2).
Offsetting (see Article 102 of the Financial Regulation 2024/250942) is — by contrast — a
measure that may be taken in relation to international organisations, however NOT as public
law measure as such but as a purely contractual measure (on the basis of Article 22.4 of the
Grant Agreement). Offsetting for international organisations will therefore be subject to the
contractual means for dispute settlement (i.e. arbitration; see Article 43.2).

22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the beneficiaries are
entitled to late-payment interest at the rate applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) for its main
refinancing operations in euros (‘reference rate’), plus the rate specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The
reference rate is the rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the coordinator only on
request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional and local
government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State for the purpose of this
Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not be considered
as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for payment (see
above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.
22.5.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see
Article 29) and the grant or the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Late-payment interest (to be paid by the EU)
If the granting authority pays late, i.e. beyond the payment deadlines, it will automatically
pay the consortium late payment interest for the overdue period unless:
− all beneficiaries in the Grant Agreement are Member States or entities acting on behalf
of Member States or
− the deadline for payment is actually not overdue because the payment deadline is
formally suspended (see Article 29) or payments are formally suspended (see Article
30) or
− the amount of the late-payment interest is not higher than EUR 200, in which case it
will only be paid upon request from the coordinator.
Late-payment interest is paid separately and on top of the grant amounts.
Late-payment interest may also be due from the beneficiaries, if they must pay back
undue amounts in the context of a recovery and are late with this payment (see Article 22.2).

[OPTION 1 for programmes without pre-financing guarantees: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with pre-financing guarantees:
23.1 Pre-financing guarantee
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2), the beneficiaries must provide (one or more)
pre-financing guarantee(s) in accordance with the timing and the amounts set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them to the granting authority in due time before the pre-financing they are
linked to.
The guarantees must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the following
conditions:
(a) be provided by a bank or approved financial institution established in the EU or — if requested by
the coordinator and accepted by the granting authority — by a third party or a bank or financial
institution established outside the EU offering equivalent security
(b) the guarantor stands as first-call guarantor and does not require the granting authority to first have
recourse against the principal debtor (i.e. the beneficiary concerned) and
(c) remain explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the form of a
recovery, until five months after the debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
They will be released within the following month.
23.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If the beneficiaries breach their obligation to provide the pre-financing guarantee, the pre-financing will not
be paid.
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.]
1. Pre-financing guarantees (most programmes, except HE)
What? For programmes that allow for pre-financing guarantees (most programmes except
HE), a guarantee may be required in particular where the financial capacity checks of one (or
more) of the beneficiaries in the consortium reveal weaknesses. The guarantee will be asked
from the coordinator, for the entire consortium. It allows the granting authority to protect
itself against the risk of losing pre-financing (i.e. the consortium not being able to honour a
recovery debt at the end of the action).
When? Where required by the granting authority, guarantees are a prerequisite for paying
out the pre-financing. They are therefore usually requested during grant preparation and
have to be provided by the coordinator before grant signature.
However, the obligation to provide a valid guarantee continues to apply during the entire
project. If for any reason the guarantee becomes invalid (e.g. because the issuing bank
ceases its operations), it needs to be replaced by a new guarantee. If the coordinator
refuses to provide a new guarantee, the grant can be terminated.
248EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
How? Pre-financing guarantees usually take the form of a guarantee by a bank or other
approved financial institution established in the EU. The costs for obtaining such a guarantee
can be declared as eligible cost under the Grant Agreement. If accepted by the granting
authority, guarantees can also be obtained from other providers (e.g. subsidiaries may obtain
a guarantee from their parent company).
The pre-financing guarantee must be sent by the coordinator as original (by registered post
with proof of delivery OR courier service) to the postal address of the granting authority.

covered by the certificate and will not be counted for calculating the threshold (if any). ]

consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
1. Certificate on the financial statements
What? If a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) is required for an interim or final
payment, the beneficiaries (and affiliated entities) concerned must provide it as part of the
periodic reporting (see Article 21.2).
The CFS is a certificate covering the actual costs and costs (or contributions) according to
usual accounting practices contained in a financial statement.
It is based on agreed-upon procedures within the meaning of International Standard on
Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (revised) for Agreed-upon Procedures Engagements issued by
the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
Provided that the provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC (or similar standards) are complied
with, the participant is free to choose a qualified external auditor, including its usual
external auditor:
251EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘qualified’ means qualified in accordance with national legislation implementing
Directive 2006/4343 (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive)
− ‘external’ means the auditor is independent from the participant.
In accordance with the agreed-upon procedures set out in the CFS, the CFS auditor must
report on the correct declaration of cost in the financial statement, i.e. that they are
accurately recorded in the beneficiary’s accounting system and eligible.
The CFS auditor has to explain findings of deviation from the rules (for any reason) in detail
in the certificate. The granting authority will consider the explanation in light of the facts
reported by the auditor, and decide on steps to take.
If the auditor finds discrepancies/exceptions, the cost item should normally not be
included in the financial statement submitted to the granting authority (and does not need to
be mentioned in the CFS). However, if the issue cannot be rectified by excluding the costs
from the financial statement or is of more serious systemic nature, it should be reported to
the EU project officer in charge of your grant.
When & How? The CFS must be provided by the beneficiary concerned, as part of their
financial report, directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool. The template is available there
for download.
The CFS threshold and schedule are set out in the Data Sheet, Point 4.3. It depends on the
amount of EU contribution requested (new for 2021-2027: not only the amount of actual
costs and unit costs according to usual cost accounting practices declared) and is calculated
automatically by the system for each entity separately; i.e. each beneficiary/affiliated entity
must submit a CFS if they reach the threshold (without taking into account the EU
contribution requested by the others).
If the participation of the beneficiary in the grant has been audited by they granting
authority, costs and contributions covered by the audit are NOT counted for the
threshold. If nevertheless the beneficiary reaches the threshold (after deducting the costs
and contributions audited) those do not need to be covered (again) by the CFS.
If a certificate is required, it must cover all applicable cost categories set out in the template.
The costs of a required CFS are eligible under the applicable cost category (usually category
C.3 as a cost for services). The costs for CFS that are not mandatory (e.g. because the
threshold was not reached or because it was not required in that reporting period) are NOT
eligible (because not necessary for the action).
Examples (errors):

Point 4.3 of the Data Sheet: CFS mandatory only at final payment and only if requested EU
contribution to costs ≥ EUR 430 000

are not eligible (wrong timing)
Beneficiary B requests EUR 380 000 of EU contribution and submits a CFS at the final payment: the
costs of the CFS are not eligible (wrong threshold)

252EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The CFS does not affect the granting authority’s right to carry out its own assessment or
audits. Neither does the reimbursement of costs covered by a certificate preclude the
granting authority, the European Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), the
European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) or the European Court of Auditors from carrying
out checks, reviews, audits and investigations in accordance with the Grant Agreement.
Specific case (CFS):
Public bodies — Public bodies can choose an external auditor or an independent public
officer. In this case, independence is usually defined as independence ‘in fact and in
appearance’ (e.g. that the officer is not involved in drawing up the financial statements). It is
for each public body to appoint the public officer and ensure their independence. The
certificate should refer to this appointment.
Pillar-assessed entities — Pillar-assessed participants can choose their regular internal or
external auditors in accordance with their internal financial regulations and procedures as
assessed by the European Commission in accordance with Article 157(3) of the Financial
Regulation 2024/250944 (see Article 10.3).

methodology for declaring costs according to usual accounting practices complies with the

subsequently, unless the beneficiary concealed information for the purpose of the approval.]

1. Certificate on the compliance of the methodology for usual cost accounting
practices (CoMUC) (DEP, EDF, CEF, UCPM)
What? For programmes where costs (or contributions) according to usual accounting
practices are eligible (DEP, EDF, CEF? UCPM) beneficiaries (and affiliated entities) that use
these accounting practices to charge costs under their grants may submit a certificate on the
compliance of usual cost accounting practices (CoMUC) to the granting authority for approval.
The CoMUC is a certificate covering the methodology that is used to charge costs (or
contributions) according to usual cost accounting practices.
It is a certificate based on agreed-upon procedures within the meaning of International
Standard on Related Services (ISRS) 4400 (revised) for Agreed-upon Procedures
Engagements issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
Provided that the provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC (or similar standards) are complied
with, the participant is free to choose a qualified external auditor, including its usual
external auditor:
254EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘qualified’ means qualified in accordance with national legislation implementing
Directive 2006/4345 (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive)
− ‘external’ means the auditor is independent from the participant.
When & How? Requests for approval can be submitted at any time to the granting authority
of an ongoing grant.
Best practice: In order to ensure that the auditor has enough information to get assurance on
the methodology, it is recommended to request it only after the first reporting period has
passed.
Approval is limited to the (cost) accounting practices described and certified in the certificate.
Approval is valid for:
− all grants of the beneficiary under the EU programme for which it was submitted (it is
not limited to a single grant)
− all costs and contributions declared according to the certified accounting practices,
including costs and contributions declared before the granting authority approval (if
the beneficiary can show that they were declared according to the approved
practices).
If the granting authority approves the CoMUC, it will afterwards not challenge any amounts
that the beneficiary declares using the certified methodology — unless information was
concealed or fraud or corruption was used to obtain the approval.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should nevertheless keep detailed records and other supporting
documents (to prove that their methodology complied with the rules, if necessary).
If the beneficiary changes its accounting practices, the certificate does not apply to any
cost incurred under the changed accounting practices. The beneficiary may submit another
request for approval to the granting authority for the new practices.
If the beneficiary declares personnel costs according to the changed cost accounting
practices before the new certificate is approved, it bears the full risk of non-approval and
cost rejection by the granting authority.
If the beneficiary also has grants in other EU programmes with similar cost eligibility rules,
the CoMUC can in principle also be relied on for these other programmes. However, it is at
the discretion of the granting authorities of those other programmes, whether they consider
their rules as equivalent and accept the CoMUC also for their programme.
The costs of the CoMUC are NOT eligible and cannot be charged to the EU action (because
not necessary for the action — the CoMUC is not mandatory and not linked to a specific
action).
Specific case (CoMUC):
Public bodies — Public bodies can choose an external auditor or an independent public
officer. In this case, independence is usually defined as independence ‘in fact and in

General > Article 24.4 SPA
24.4 Systems and process audit (SPA)
24.4 Systems and process audit (SPA)
[OPTION 1 by default: Not applicable ]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with SPA: Beneficiaries which:
- use unit, flat rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to documented (i.e. formally
approved and in writing) usual costs accounting practices (if any) or
- have formalised documentation on the systems and processes for calculating their costs and
contributions (i.e. formally approved and in writing), have participated in at least […] actions under
[insert name of previous programme, e.g. Horizon 2020] and participate in at least […] ongoing
actions under [insert name of current programme, e.g. Horizon Europe]
may apply to the granting authority for a systems and process audit (SPA).
This audit will be carried out as follows:
Step 1 — Application by the beneficiary.
Step 2 — If the application is accepted, the granting authority will carry out the systems and process
audit, complemented by an audit of transactions (on a sample of the beneficiary’s [insert name
of current programme, e.g. Horizon Europe] financial statements).
Step 3 — The audit result will take the form of a risk assessment classification for the beneficiary: low,
medium or high.
Low-risk beneficiaries will benefit from less (or less in-depth) ex-post audits (see Article 25) and a higher
threshold for submitting certificates on the financial statements (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data
Sheet, Point 4.3). ]
1. Combined review (SPA)
The provision is only used by Horizon Europe and open only to a relatively small group of
beneficiaries that fulfil the criteria (repetitive and frequent participation in several consecutive
programmes required). If needed, the granting authority will provide guidance directly to the
beneficiaries concerned.

24.5 Consequences of non-compliance
24.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary does not submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) or the certificate is rejected,
the accepted EU contribution to costs will be capped to reflect the CFS threshold.
If a beneficiary breaches any of its other obligations under this Article, the granting authority may apply the
measures described in Chapter 5. ]
1. Missing CFS
If a beneficiary must submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS, see Articles 21
and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3) but fails to do so, their maximum EU contribution to
costs will be capped at the CFS threshold in the Data Sheet minus one Euro.
Example: The terminated beneficiary requested in total EUR 490 000 as EU funding for costs.
According to the Data Sheet, a CFS is necessary if the requested EU contribution to costs ≥ EUR
430 000. If the beneficiary does not submit the CFS, the maximum EU contribution to costs will be
capped at EUR 429 999.

25.1 Granting authority checks, reviews and audits
25.1.1 Internal checks
The granting authority may — during the action or afterwards — check the proper implementation of the
action and compliance with the obligations under the Agreement, including assessing costs and contributions,
deliverables and reports.
1. Checks (by the granting authority)
What & When? The granting authority may — at any moment including after the end —
check aspects relating to the grant relating to the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples:
1. After receiving the reports (see Article 21), the granting authority checks the different
documents (explanation of the work carried out, overview of the progress, explanation of the
use of resources, etc.), for consistency with the description and work plan of the action.
2. The granting authority performs a plagiarism check on documents submitted by the
consortium.
3. After receiving information about misconducts concerning an entity that participates in EU
actions, the granting authority checks all the grant in order to see if it needs to take action.
4. After the end of the action, the granting authority receives a complaint by one of the
beneficiaries that another beneficiary does not respect its intellectual property obligations and
decides to look into this allegation.
These checks may concern beneficiaries or other partners involved in the action — which is
why beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights towards
other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties providing in-kind
contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP)) by
including appropriate clauses in their contracts with them, see Articles 8 and 9.
Checks themselves are internal, i.e. usually carried out directly by staff of the granting
authority based on available documents. If needed, the granting authority may, however,
request information from the beneficiaries (see Article 19.1).
Example: An internal check shows that the beneficiaries did not clearly explain the allocation
and use of resources in their periodic report. The granting authority asks for more information
by a given date.
The granting authority may carry out these checks on its own or with the assistance of
external expert(s) — without asking the beneficiaries for approval before appointing them.
In this case, the granting authority will ensure that there is no conflict of interest by asking
the expert(s) to sign a declaration.
259EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the check shows ineligible costs or contributions or serious breach of obligations, this may
lead to rejection or grant reduction and, if necessary, recovery (see Articles 27, 28 and 22.2)
or any other measure mentioned in Chapter 5.
If a more in-depth examination is required, the granting authority may start a review or an
audit.

General > Article 25.1.2 Granting authority project reviews
25.1.2 Project reviews
25.1.2 Project reviews
The granting authority may carry out reviews on the proper implementation of the action and compliance
with the obligations under the Agreement (general project reviews or specific issues reviews).
Such project reviews may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out
in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned
and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent, outside experts. If it uses outside experts,
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right to object on grounds of
commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline
requested — any information and data in addition to deliverables and reports already submitted (including
information on the use of resources). The granting authority may request beneficiaries to provide such
information to it directly. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings, including with the
outside experts.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises (including to the
outside experts) and must ensure that information requested is readily available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
On the basis of the review findings, a project review report will be drawn up.
The granting authority will formally notify the project review report to the coordinator or beneficiary
concerned, which has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations.
Project reviews (including project review reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed with the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
1. Project reviews (by the granting authority)
What? The granting authority may — at any moment and until the time-limit set out in the
Data Sheet (Point 6) — carry out a project review.
Reviews normally concern mainly the technical implementation of the action, but they may
also cover financial and budgetary aspects or compliance with other obligations under the
Grant Agreement. They usually concern the entire project, but may exceptionally also focus
on issues related to only one specific beneficiary.
They may also extend to other participants involved in the action — which is why
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights also towards
those other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients
of financial support to third parties (FSTP)) by including appropriate clauses in their contracts
with them, see Articles 8 and 9.
Project reviews consist in an in-depth examination (often done with the help of independent
experts) of the progress of the action, and in particular:
− the degree to which the work plan has been carried out and whether all expected
deliverables were completed
− whether the objectives of the action are still relevant
261EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− how resources were planned and used in relation to the achieved progress, and if their
use respected the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness
− the management procedures and methods of the action
− the beneficiaries’ contributions and integration within the action
− for Horizon Europe: the expected potential scientific, technological, economic,
competitive and social impact, and plans for using and disseminating results.
For some types of action, they are done regularly (e.g. for the periodic reports related to a
payment, to help the granting authority to properly assess the action implementation and the
work carried out by the beneficiaries), for others they are done ad hoc.
If the review shows ineligible costs or contributions, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud
or serious breach of obligations (including non- or improper implementation of the action as
described in Annex 1), this may lead to suspension, termination, rejection, grant reduction
and recovery (see Articles 30, 31, 32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and to exclusion and/or financial
penalties (see Article 34).
If carried out during the implementation of the action, a review may also recommend
reorientations to the action.
2. Procedure
How? The review will be initiated by a project review invitation letter sent to the
coordinator (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary concerned) through the Portal.
The letter will also mention the names of the independent experts that have been appointed
(if any). The consortium may object to an expert, but only on the grounds of commercial
confidentiality or conflict of interests.
The review may include on-the-spot visits or a review meeting (on the granting authority
premises or anywhere relevant for the action). If there is a meeting, the invitation will
indicate the documents that will be discussed, normally:
− Annex 1 (the contractual description of the action against which the assessment will
be made)
− for periodic reviews: the periodic report(s) (technical and financial) for the period(s)
under review (including documents related to financial/budgetary issues)
− deliverables that were due
− for final reviews: the periodic reports (technical and financial) for all periods (including
documents related to financial/budgetary issues).
The results of the review will be recorded in a project review report.
The project review report together with the granting authority comments will be notified to
the coordinator (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary concerned), who will have 30 days to
submit observations (contradictory project review procedure; not to be confused with
the separate contradictory procedure for any subsequent rejection, grant reduction or
suspension/termination procedure under Articles 27, 28, 31 and 32).
The granting authority operational services (authorising officers) will analyse the comments
received and decide on the follow-up, if any.

General > Article 25.1.3 Granting authority audits
25.1.3 Audits
25.1.3 Audits
The granting authority may carry out audits on the proper implementation of the action and compliance with
the obligations under the Agreement.
Such audits may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the beneficiary concerned and will be considered to
start on the date of the notification.
The granting authority may use its own audit service, delegate audits to a centralised service or use external
audit firms. If it uses an external firm, the beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right to object
on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline requested — any
information (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data) to verify
compliance with the Agreement. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with
Article 13.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises (including for the
external audit firm) and must ensure that information requested is readily available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including
electronic format.
On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which has 30 days from
receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and will be formally
notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
1. Audits (by the granting authority)
What? The granting authority may — at any moment and up until the time-limit set out in
the Data Sheet (Point 6) — carry out an audit.
Record-keeping — Once an audit has started, the beneficiary must keep ALL the
records and supporting documents until the audit procedure AND its follow-up (including
rejection, grant reduction, recovery and litigation) are completed.
Example: If the beneficiary archives the paper copies of the original supporting documentation not on
its premises, the documentation must be retrieved and sent there in time for the audit fieldwork.
Audits normally focus the financial implementation of the action by a beneficiary (i.e. financial
and budgetary implementation), but they may also cover technical aspects or compliance
with other obligations under the Grant Agreement (i.e. an in-depth examination of the
implementation of the action by the beneficiary). This examination is carried out by
professional (external or granting authority in -house) auditors according to generally
accepted audit standards.
They may also extend to other participants involved in the action — which is why
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority can exercise its rights also towards
those other participants (affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients
263EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
of financial support to third parties (FSTP) and, for HE, also third parties providing in-kind
contributions) by including appropriate clauses in their contracts with them, see Articles 8
and 9.
With the exception of affiliated entities (who are usually audited directly; see specific cases
below), the audit procedure for any third party will formally be with the beneficiary and the
beneficiary will be responsible for ensuring that the auditors have access to all necessary
documents and to carry out checks on the third party’s premises.
If the audit shows, ineligible costs or contributions, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud
or serious breach of obligations, this may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection,
grant reduction and recovery (see Articles 30, 31, 32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and, in very serious
cases, to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see Article 34). In some cases, findings may
result in the acceptance of additional costs (if the beneficiary declared them).
Specific cases (audits):
Affiliated entities — In contrast to other third parties, the granting authority will audit
affiliated entities, as if they are beneficiaries. The audit will be carried out on the premises of
the affiliated entity and all communication concerning the audit will be carried out directly
with it (e.g. audit initiation letter, contradictory audit procedure; audit result
implementation). However, since the financial consequences in case of recovery would
normally have to be borne by the beneficiary to which the entity is affiliated (see Article
22.2), the granting authority will also notify the beneficiary about launching the audit, as well
as about a summary of its conclusions.
Audits for periodical assessment of eligible costs or contributions based on units,
lump sums and flat rates — The European Commission may also audit the accounting
records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost items for which
it has fixed unit costs or contributions, flat-rates or lump-sums (for statistical purposes or to
gather data to assess their adequacy). Such audits will normally have no direct consequences
for the beneficiaries that were audited; even if the actual costs turn out to be lower, this will
not lead to a rejection of costs (— except in exceptional cases e.g. where the audit reveals
non-compliance with other obligations, e.g. under national law or wrongful information in the
proposal, etc).
2. Procedure
How? The audit will be initiated by a letter of announcement (LoA) sent to the beneficiary
(or affiliated entity) concerned through the Portal.
If the granting authority uses an external audit firm, this letter will mention its name. The
beneficiary may object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interests
(together with the reasons why) and — if justified — the granting authority may decide to
appoint another external auditor (or, in exceptional circumstances, to carry out the audit
itself).
The audit usually involves a desk review of the documents requested from the beneficiary
and an on-the-spot visit (i.e. on the beneficiary’s premises or on the site on which the
action is being implemented). There may however also be audits that consist only in a desk
review.
The auditors will request access to a wide range of records and documentation (e.g. payslips,
labour contracts, complete statutory accounts, etc.) and will indicate how and when it must
be provided (and in which format).
The beneficiary must provide the auditors with all requested information, records and
supporting documents (in the format and within the deadline specified).
Example: A hard copy list of records from the general ledger (accounting document) disclosing
hundreds or thousands of transactions is impossible to process manually, therefore the auditors will
normally require an electronic version.
264EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Objections based on data protection or confidentiality will NOT be accepted. Where the
records and documentation contain personal data, the granting authority will process it in
compliance with Regulation 2018/1725 and the beneficiary must inform the persons
concerned about this processing (see Article 15.1).
Confidential data will be processed in accordance with Article 13.
Failure to provide the requested information (in the requested format and within the specified
deadline) will lead to the rejection of costs or contributions (and possibly other measures,
such as recovery, suspension of payments, termination, administrative and financial
penalties, etc.).
For on-the-spot audits, the beneficiary must allow access to its premises and ensure that all
records and supporting documentation are readily available. This includes granting access to
research facilities and interviewing the researchers that worked on the action.
The results of the audit will be recorded in an audit report.
The draft audit report will be sent to the beneficiary concerned, who will have 30 days to
submit observations (contradictory audit procedure; not to be confused with the separate
contradictory procedure for any subsequent rejection or grant reduction under Articles 27 and
28).
The audit procedure will be closed (by the granting authority auditors) with the final audit
report and the audit letter of conclusion (LoC) — and the file will then be passed on to
the granting authority for the follow-up, if any.
Please do NOT take any immediate action at this point — even if the audit found ineligible
costs/breaches. Do NOT deduct them from the next financial statement. The proposed
adjustments must first be analysed and will, if needed, be implemented by the granting authority
at the next payment. You will be informed by payment letter/audit implementation pre-information
letter and have another possibility to submit observations.

General > Article 25.2 Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting authorities
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights of checks,
reviews and audits as the granting authority.
1. Checks, reviews and audits (by the European Commission)
EU grants are often not managed by the European Commission itself, but by legally separate
entities such as EU executive agencies or joint undertakings. The European Commission is in
these cases not the granting authority but does retain equivalent rights for checks, reviews
and audits.
Where the European Commission conducts such a check, review or audit of an action of
another granting authority, the guidance provided above applies mutatis mutandis, see
Articles 25.1.1, 25.1.2, 25.1.3.

The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the periodic
assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.
1. Access to assess simplified forms of funding (by the European Commission)
The European Commission may access the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain
general information about real costs of cost items for which it has fixed unit costs or
contributions, flat-rates or lump-sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data to assess
their adequacy). Such access will normally have no direct consequences for the beneficiaries.
Even if the actual costs turn out to be lower than the simplified form of funding, this will not
lead to a rejection of costs.

- the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) under Regulation 2017/1939
- the European Court of Auditors (ECA) under Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU
(TFEU) and Article 263 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If requested by these bodies, the beneficiary concerned must provide full, accurate and complete information
in the format requested (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data,
including in electronic format) and allow access to sites and premises for on-the-spot visits or inspections —
as provided for under these Regulations.
To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the action, at least until
the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until any ongoing checks, reviews, audits,
investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have been concluded.

1. OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
In addition to the granting authority and the European Commission, you can also have a
check, review, audit or investigation from any of the following:
− the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF): OLAF is the EU’s anti-fraud office,
responsible for investigating fraud against the EU budget.
If the granting authority suspects that a beneficiary or third party involved in an
action committed fraud or other illegal acts, it will inform OLAF (and/or EPPO), who
may decide to investigate.
OLAF will send the outcome of the investigation to the granting authority, who will
then decide how to proceed.
− the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO): EPPO is an independent and
decentralised prosecution office of the European Union, with the competence to
investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment crimes against the EU budget, such as
fraud, corruption or serious cross-border VAT fraud.
− the European Court of Auditors (ECA): ECA is the independent external auditing
body for all European institutions. As such, it may carry out audits on all recipients of
EU funds (including beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners,
subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) and, for HE,
also third parties providing in-kind contributions).
268EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Depending on the outcome, the results of such an audit may be notified to the
beneficiary.
These bodies are not subject to the time-limits for audits and reviews set out in the Data
Sheet (Point 6) for the granting authority. They may carry out their activities at any point
during or after the action.
If the check, review, audit or investigation shows ineligible costs or contributions,
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations, it may lead
to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant reduction and recovery (see Articles 30, 31,
32, 27, 28 and 22.2) and, in very serious cases, to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see
Article 34).

25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant may lead to
rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount (see Article
22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may lead to a request
for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach
of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal prosecution under
national law.

Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to any of the measures described in Chapter 5 (i.e. cost rejections, grant
reductions, suspension, termination, etc).
If they find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations, this
may also lead to consequences in other EU grants awarded under similar conditions
(‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings leading to OLAF or EPPO investigations may also lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.

General > Article 25.5.2 Extension from other grants
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Results of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar conditions, to have
committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations that have a
material impact on this grant and
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the list of grants
affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to extend the findings
and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of costs or contributions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or recurrent errors, to
calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or recurrent errors
and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations, revised financial
statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the implementation (i.e.
start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the revised financial statements or the
announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see Articles 27 and 28).
1. Extension of findings from other grants
Findings from other EU grants may also impact the grant. Article 25.5.2 alloIhe granting
authority to apply measures (e.g. cost rejection or grant reduction) , if there were issues in
other EU grants in which the beneficiary participates or participated (i.e. including past
grants), provided that the extension is notified within the audit time limit (see DataSheet,
Point 6), and the findings have:
− ‘systemic or recurrent’ nature, meaning not just an individual occurrence in one
other grant but something expected to affect all similar activities of the beneficiary
also in other grants
Example (extension): During an audit of another grant, the granting authority detected
systematic irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs (e.g. recurrent errors in the time-
recording systems for personnel). The beneficiary has used the same practice in all EU grants.
271EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− ‘similar conditions’, meaning that the other grant contains obligations that are
similar enough to the obligations of the present grant that errors in the other grant
would also be errors under the rules of the present grant.
Example (no extension): During an audit of the beneficiary’s participation in another grant,
the granting authority detected recurrent errors in the record of actual cost for travel and
subsistence. However, in the present grant the beneficiary uses unit cost for travel and
subsistence. Therefore other rules apply an errors in the actual cost do not affect the unit cost
under the present grant (in this case).
− ‘material impact on this grant’, meaning that findings in other grants must be
relevant in the context of implementation of the present grant, i.e. leading to a
measurable error.
Example (no extension): During an audit of another grant, the granting authority detected
systematic (accidental) errors in the calculation of depreciation of equipment of the beneficiary.
While the present grant follows the same cost eligibility rules on equipment, the beneficiary has
only declared personnel and subcontracting costs for the implementation of the present grant.
Therefore, findings on equipment costs in other grants have no impact on the present grant.
2. Procedure
How? The audit extension procedure will be initiated as part of the letter of audit
conclusions (LoC) and the beneficiary concerned will be asked to provide further
documents and information and observations.
Once the necessary documents and information are received, the audit extension procedure
will be closed (by the granting authority auditors) with the audit extension complete
letter — and the file will then be passed on to the granting authorities of the concerned
projects for the follow-up, if any.
Please do NOT take any immediate action at this point. The proposed extensions must
first be analysed and will, if needed, be implemented by the granting authorities of the
concerned projects. You will be informed by payment letter/audit implementation pre-
information letter and have another possibility to submit observations.

General > Article 25.5.2 Consequences of non-compliance
25.5.2 Consequences of non-compliance
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions insufficiently
substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 27), and the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Refusal to give access for checks, reviews, audits or investigations
The beneficiaries (and through Article 9 also the other partners involved in the action) are
obliged to give access to the granting authority/Commission/OLAF/EPPO/ECA for the checks,
reviews, audits and investigations set out in Article 25 of the Grant Agreement.
If they refuse such access or otherwise intentionally and without proper justification resist a
check, review, audit or investigation, this constitutes a breach of the Grant Agreement.
The consequences depend on the case. If the refusal means that certain costs or
contributions could not be verified (and are thus insufficiently substantiated), they will be
considered ineligible and rejected (see Article 27). In addition (or if there is no impact on
specific costs or contributions), the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).

General > Article 26 — Impact evaluations
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the objectives and
indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or beneficiaries and will be
considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact of the action,
including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may apply the
measures described in Chapter 5.
1. Impact evaluations
In principle, for 2021-2027, all programmes measure the impact of the actions through the
key performance indicators (KPIs) that are collected as part of the continuous reporting.
The formal evaluation procedure set out in this provision is therefore currently not in active
use by any of the programmes using the General Model Grant Agreement. If needed, the
granting authority will provide guidance directly to the beneficiaries.

CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
General > Article 27 — Rejection of costs/contributions
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at beneficiary termination, interim payment, final payment or afterwards —
reject any costs or contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in particular following checks, reviews,
audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant (see Article 25).
Ineligible costs or contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the coordinator or
beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary
concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the
rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory procedure with pre-
information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions, it will deduct them from the costs or contributions
declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
1. Rejection of costs or contributions
What? If the granting authority finds ineligible costs or contributions (in particular,
following a check, audit, extension of audit findings, review or investigation), it will reject
them (— in full, i.e. for the amount that is ineligible).
Grounds for cost or contribution rejection (by the EU):
▪ Costs or contributions do not comply with the Grant Agreement’s general
eligibility rules, see Article 6.1
▪ Costs or contributions do not comply with the Grant Agreement’s specific
eligibility rules, see Article 6.2
▪ Costs or contributions fall under the categories of ineligible costs or
contributions, see Article 6.3.
Whereas rejection will usually be based on findings of the granting authority under the
respective grant, it may also happen that costs or contributions are rejected based on
extension of audit findings (see Article 25.5) from other grants, if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or similar rules
applicable)
275EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the ineligibility is:
− systemic or recurrent, and
− has a material impact across grants.
When? Rejection of costs or contributions can take place at any moment — at the time of
beneficiary termination, interim payment, payment of the balance or afterwards (e.g.
following ex-post audits).
Cost or contributions must comply with general and specific eligibility conditions and not
fall under the categories of ineligible cost. Any cost or contributions that do not comply with
all of these conditions may be rejected (see Article 6).
2. Procedure
How? The beneficiaries will be informed about the cost rejections and given the opportunity
to submit their observations.
Formally speaking, the procedure is slightly different:
− if rejection leads to a recovery: the procedure is a standard contradictory
procedure
− if rejection does NOT lead to a recovery (just a decreased payment): the procedure is
apayment review procedure.
The difference in the two procedures is in the timing. In case of recoveries, there is nothing
to pay out, so the procedure foresees a standard contradictory procedure. In case of positive
amount to pay, the procedure switches to the payment review procedure in order to allow the
granting authority to immediately pay out undisputed amounts and focus the
observations/review on the disputed amounts.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Payment review procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator about the rejection of costs or
contributions and notifies the amounts that will be paid out (notification of
amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Step 2 — If the beneficiaries disagree, the coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days
to inform the granting authority of its objections.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the request for review and informs the
coordinator of its outcome.
Depending on the moment when costs or contributions are rejected, this procedure will be
directed either at the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
276EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− for rejections at the time of an interim payment or the final payment: normally the
coordinator
− for rejections after beneficiary termination and after final payment: normally the
beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries
concerned via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of
delivery, etc) and ask for their comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries.
If it is directed at the beneficiary during the action, the granting authority will inform the
coordinator later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality). Beneficiaries should inform
their coordinator if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action (see Article 19.3).
If it is directed at the beneficiary after the action, beneficiaries do not have to inform their
coordinators or ask them to submit comments.
3. Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions at beneficiary termination, it will
deduct the rejected amount from the costs or contributions that the beneficiary declared in
the termination report and calculate the amount due to the beneficiary. If the amount is
lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary, the
granting authority will recover the difference (see Article 22.3.2).
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions at the moment of an interim
payment or the final payment, it will deduct them and calculate the amount to be paid
accordingly (see Articles 22.3.3 and 22.3.4).
If ineligible costs or contributions are found in-between payments, the granting authority
will reject them at the next payment (i.e. deduct the amount rejected from the amounts
declared in the next financial statement and calculate the amount to be paid accordingly; see
Article 22).
If the granting authority rejects costs after the final payment, it will deduct the amount
rejected from the amounts accepted for the beneficiary at the final payment and calculate a
revised final grant amount for the beneficiary. This may be followed by a recovery if
needed (see Article 22.3.5).
277EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Article 28 — Grant reduction
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — reduce the grant for
a beneficiary, if:
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including improper
implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics or security rules (if
applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant (see Article 25).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and proportionate to the
seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, by applying an
individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the coordinator
or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the reasons why. The coordinator or
beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — submit observations if it disagrees
with the reduction (payment review procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory procedure with
pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the amount due
(and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
1.Grant reduction
What? If the granting authority finds (e.g. following a check, audit, extension of audit
findings, review or investigation) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of
obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-compliance with the call
conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach of
ethics, values or security rules, etc) under the Grant Agreement or during the award
procedure, it may reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the finding.
Grant reductions will be made in proportion to the seriousness of the error, irregularity,
fraud or breach (e.g. in case of fraud the reduction may be up to a 100%).
If the issues are found before the end of the action, the beneficiaries must take all
possible corrective steps to bring the action implementation back into line with the Grant
Agreement.
1. The monthly declaration of days worked in the project correctly signed (see Article
20) OR reliable time records will normally be sufficient proof of the assignment to 278
the action — unless there is other contradicting evidence (e.g. the employment
contract indicates that the person was hired to work on another project).EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Grounds for grant reduction:
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may make a grant reduction if a beneficiary has committed
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations — either
during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement.
Serious breach of obligations may cover all kinds of non-compliance with Grant
Agreement obligations (including obligations during the award procedure).
Example: False declarations in the proposal form in order to obtain EU funding.
In practice, the most frequent breach is improper implementation of the
action/non-compliance with Annex 1 (i.e. if the work performed does not
correspond to the activities described in Annex1). This will normally be examined
on the basis of the periodic and final technical reports and, if needed, a project
review.
Breaches of other obligations, such as the obligation to respect and commit to EU
values (see Article 14), may also lead to grant reductions.
Example: A non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless of religious
or political background released very controversial statements of xenophobic nature, in
particular by calling to destroy country X. One of the activities which was supposed to be
implemented by the entity was cancelled by the subcontractor because of these
statements. In the specific context of the action in question , these statements were
considered a breach of the obligation to respect EU values (non-discrimination). This
conduct led to a reduction of the grant amount (among other measures).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also make a grant reduction, if such substantial errors,
irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants,
if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
When? Grant reductions will be made at beneficiary termination, at the end of the action or
after the payment of the balance.
2. Procedure
How? The beneficiaries will be informed about the grant reductions and given the
opportunity to submit their observations.
Formally speaking, the procedure is slightly different:
− if reduction leads to a recovery: the procedure is a standard contradictory
procedure
− if reduction does NOT lead to a recovery (just a decreased payment): the procedure is
apayment review procedure.
279EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The difference in the two procedures is in the timing. In case of recoveries, there is nothing
to pay out, so the procedure foresees a standard contradictory procedure. In case of positive
amount to pay, the procedure switches to the payment review procedure in order to allow the
granting authority to immediately pay out undisputed amounts and focus the
observations/review on the reduction.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 22.3).
Payment review procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator about the reduction and notifies
the amounts that will be paid out (notification of amounts due; see Article
22.3).
Step 2 — If the beneficiaries disagree, the coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days
to inform the granting authority of its objections.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the request for review and informs the
coordinator of its outcome.
Depending on the moment when reduction takes place, this procedure will be directed either
at the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
− for reductions at the time of the final payment: normally the coordinator
− for reductions after beneficiary termination and after final payment: normally the
beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries
concerned via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of
delivery, etc.) and ask for their comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries.
If it is directed at the beneficiary during the action, the granting authority will inform the
coordinator later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality). Beneficiaries should inform their
coordinator if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action (see Article 19.3).
If it is directed at the beneficiary after the action, beneficiaries do not have to inform their
coordinators or ask them to submit comments.
3. Effects
If the granting authority makes a reduction at beneficiary termination, it will deduct the
reduction from the accepted EU contribution based on the costs or contributions that the
beneficiary declared in the termination report and calculate the amount due to the
beneficiary. If the amount is lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by
the beneficiary, the granting authority will recover the difference (see Article 22.3.2).
If the granting authority makes a reduction at the final payment, it will deduct them and
calculate the amount to be paid accordingly (see Article 22.3.4).
If the granting authority makes a reduction after the final payment, it will deduct the
amount reduced from the accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary at the final payment
280EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
and calculate a revised final grant amount. This may be followed by a recovery if needed
(see Article 22.3.5).

SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
General > Article 29 — Payment deadline suspension
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment cannot be
processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or additional
information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing audit extension procedure, queries about
eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations
are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — and
the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to confirm if the
suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the revised report is
not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority may also terminate the grant or
the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. Suspension of the payment deadline (by the EU)
What? The granting authority must make its payments in accordance with the timeline set
out in the Data Sheet (usually 30 days from grant signature/start of project for initial
prefinancing and 60 or 90 days from reception of the additional pre-financing/periodic report.
If the deadline is missed, late payment interest will be due by the granting authority (see
below and Article 22.5) — unless the payment deadline has been suspended.
Suspension of the payment deadline must be distinguished from suspension of
payments (see Article 30). Suspension of the payment deadline is an ad hoc measure
regarding a pending payment. Suspension of payments is independent of any individual
payment request as a measure to stop making payments to a beneficiary which is, for
example, suspected of serious misconducts.
The payment deadline may be suspended temporarily on the grounds listed in this Article.
Grounds for suspension of the payment deadline (by the EU):
282EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Payment request is incomplete or requires clarification.
The granting authority may suspend the payment deadline, if the reports (or any
of their documents) are incomplete or unclear and the granting authority is
therefore not in a position to determine that the action has been properly
implemented and the payment is due.
Examples: the reports, the certificate on the financial statement or other supporting
documents are missing; the information in the periodic technical report is incomplete;
additional information on the coordinator’s new bank account is needed
▪ Doubts on the amount to be paid in the financial statements that require
additional verifications.
The granting authority may suspend the payment deadline, if it has doubts (e.g.
due to conflicting information between documents, or audit findings in other grants
on the eligibility of the costs in the financial statements) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are needed to establish the amount to be paid.
Example: The costs claimed in the financial statements are not consistent with the action
tasks described in the technical report.
▪ There are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
The granting authority may also suspend the payment deadline, if it has other
doubts on the eligibility of payment claims. It will request the necessary
information or enact other measures including by means of on-the-spot-checks if
necessary.
Example: The granting authority has received information that parts of the activities are
not properly implemented and subject to fraud.
2. Procedure
How? The granting authority will inform the coordinator of the suspension of the payment
deadline and explain the reasons why.
There is NO contradictory procedure for the suspension itself. However, if the suspension
exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the granting authority if the suspension is to
be continued (i.e. ask to confirm it or lift it). In addition, a contradictory procedure/payment
review will be available later on if the granting authority should eventually decide to dispute
amounts and make rejections/grant reductions).
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the day the notification (announcing payment deadline suspension) is
sent to the coordinator (and ends on the day it is lifted).
As soon as the suspension is started, passing days do no longer count towards the 60 or 90
day deadline set out in the DataSheet and accordingly no late-payment interest for the
beneficiaries will accrue. With the lifting of the suspension, the remaining payment period
starts to run again (as from the day-count on which the suspension started).
If the issues have been resolved satisfactorily (e.g. the coordinator sent the requested
information or re-submitted the report) or the granting authority has finished the necessary
verifications (e.g. an audit), it will lift the suspension and inform the coordinator.
If a deadline has been suspended for several reasons, it will be lifted only when the
consortium has satisfactorily addressed ALL the reasons.

General > Article 30 — Payment suspension
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for one or more
beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is suspected of having
committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including improper
implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics or security rules (if
applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant.
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make partial payment(s)
for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the payment (or recovery) of the
remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary
concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally
notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting authority will
formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the suspension end date.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For interim payments,
the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article 21) must not contain any
financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated entities). The coordinator must include
them in the next periodic report after the suspension is lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of
the action — in the last periodic report.
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. Suspension of payments (by the EU)
284EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What? The granting authority may suspend pre-financing, interim and final payments (for
one or more beneficiaries), on the grounds listed in this Article.
Suspension of payments has NO impact on the action implementation. The beneficiary
concerned must continue to work on the action, while addressing the issues that have led to
suspension of the payment; costs incurred during suspension of payments are in principle
eligible, but there will be no payments.
Grounds for suspension of payments (by the EU):
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may suspend payments, if a beneficiary has committed or is
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious
breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-
compliance with the call conditions, submission of false information, failure to
provide required information, breach of ethics, values or security rules, etc) —
either during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement.
Example:
1. False declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding
2. Based on information received from a third party, the granting authority suspects that
the beneficiary and the person who has powers of control towards the beneficiary are in
breach of EU values. The information received indicates that public statements which are
discriminatory and incite hate towards women have been made by the person who controls
the beneficiary. The granting authority suspended payments to the beneficiary until it
confirmed that the allegations were not supported by reliable evidence.
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also suspend payments, if such substantial errors,
irregularities- or, fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants,
if
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of
obligations are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systemic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other Grant
Agreements signed by the audited beneficiary. The grating authority may suspend all
outstanding payments for the audited beneficiary until the issue is resolved.
2. Procedure
How? Before suspending payments, the granting authority will follow a contradictory
procedure to give the beneficiary the possibility to submit observations.Contradictory
procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the beneficiary concerned of its intention (and
the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
285EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 — The beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An extension
may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the day the notification (confirming suspension) is sent to the
beneficiary concerned (and ends on the day it is lifted).
During suspension, NO individual financial statements may be submitted for the beneficiary
(or beneficiaries) concerned with the periodic reports (except with the report for the final
reporting period).
Costs incurred (for continuing to implement the action during suspension) are eligible and
may be included in the next financial report, after suspension has been lifted. At the latest,
they must be included in the periodic report for the final reporting period (— even if
suspension is still ongoing).
Technical reports submitted during suspension must include the work of the beneficiaries
concerned.
If payments for one (or some) of the beneficiaries are still suspended at the end of the
action, the granting authority will make a partial payment of the balance for the amount that
is not suspended (— but ONLY after having received all the necessary information for the
final calculations for ALL consortium members, i.e. including the suspended beneficiaries).
The partial final payment that will be paid out in this case is NOT the payment that
closes the action for the purposes of the deadlines set out in Point 6 of the Data Sheet. That
payment will be made only after the payment suspensions are lifted.

ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances — in
particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
− the reasons why
− the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request and
− the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately request another
amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption date (one day after suspension
end date), extend the duration and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see
Article 39) — unless the grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect
from the suspension end date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of
the amendment request.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for activities
implemented during grant suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. GA suspension (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the ground set out in
this Article.
GA suspension may be used exceptionally if it is necessary to stop the action
implementation, to fix specific problems. It should NOT be used in situations that cannot
be resolved through a temporary interruption of the project activities; in these cases, it may
be better to terminate the Grant Agreement (see Article 32).
Ground for GA suspension (by the Consortium):
▪ Action can no longer be implemented (or becomes excessively difficult)
The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), if implementation
becomes impossible or excessively difficult.
Example: A fire devastates a beneficiary’s premises, with most of the technical equipment
and computers used for the action and containing the action results. The beneficiaries
287EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
therefore request that the part of the action that is affected by this is suspended until the
premises are restored.
Information obligation — Depending on the reasons for suspension, the beneficiaries may
also have to take other measures under the Grant Agreement (e.g. inform the granting authority
under Article 19; notify a situation of force majeure under Article 35).
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the date the suspension takes effect (this date may be before the date of the
submission of the amendment request) and the expected date of resumption.
3. Effects
Suspension starts on the date specified in the amendment request.
The beneficiaries must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit the damage and do
their best to resume (i.e. continue) implementing the action as soon as possible.
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are
NOT eligible (see Article 6.3). Costs may again be incurred for the action, once action
implementation is resumed.
If the action can be continued (resumed), the coordinator must notify it to the granting
authority by requesting an amendment to the Grant Agreement.
The resumption amendment must again be requested in accordance with Article 39 (e.g. it
must be signed by the coordinator’s LSIGN).
It sets the resumption date and adapts the grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the
action duration, modifying Annexes 1 and 2, updating the reporting periods).
If the granting authority approves the resumption amendment, the suspension is lifted and
will be resumed as from the resumption date (i.e. one day after the suspension end date set
in the amendment, which can be retroactive, i.e. back to the date when the problem
stopped/issue was clarified).
Example: The action was suspended on 24.03.2023 due to an extreme weather event affecting the
premises of the coordinator and making continuous implementation of the action temporarily
unfeasible. After two months of clearing efforts, the conditions improve and the coordinator’s
premises are accessible again. The coordinator requests an amendment to set the suspension end
date on 22.05.2023. Therefore, the action will be resumed as from 23.05.2023.
If the suspension is lifted and the action resumes, the action’s remaining budget can be used
for action implementation.
If a part of the action cannot be implemented anymore (e.g. due to impossibility following the
circumstances causing the suspension), the granting authority may agree to amend the Grant
Agreement with changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation, including by
decreasing activities and budget unless changes are so significant that they call into question
the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment (see below and
Article 39).
288EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the action or a significant part of it can NOT be continued (or the granting authority does
not approve the amendment; see Article 39), the Grant Agreement (or the participation of
one or more beneficiaries) may be terminated.
In this case, NO further costs (incurred after the date of suspension) can be declared, except
the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1).
Example: The action starts on 01.01.2022 and is to last 36 months. The action’s implementation is
suspended for four months, from the date specified in the amendment request, e.g. 01.12.2022 to
31.03.2023 and the suspension leads to the Grant Agreement termination. The eligible costs are:
− costs incurred from the action’s start (01.01.2022) until the date specified in the
amendment request (30.11.2022)
− costs incurred for the submission of the first periodic report and the final report.

31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is suspected of having
committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award (including
improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the call conditions,
submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach of
ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to cooperate with checks, reviews, audits
and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or person
essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in other EU grants awarded to
it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of
obligations that have a material impact on this grant
(c) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for programmes
with linked actions: [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION
2 if selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as specified in
Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute, and this impacts the
implementation of the action under this Agreement]]
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: additional GA suspension grounds: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with additional GA suspension grounds: [additional GA suspension grounds:
insert other grounds]].
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally
notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date specified
in the notification).
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority will formally
notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the suspension end date and invite
the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to set the resumption date (one day after
suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new
situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be
lifted with effect from the suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be
before the date on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no pre-financing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for activities
implemented during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a beneficiary (see
Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
290EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
EU grants provide for different types of suspensions (suspension of the payment deadline
(specific pending payment), suspension of all future payments and suspension of the grant
agreement). Check the correct guidance
1. GA suspension (by the EU)
What? The granting authority may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the grounds
listed in this Article.
Grounds for GA suspension (by the EU):
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may suspend the action, if a beneficiary (or one of its
person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or one of its
person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed or is
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious
breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been properly implemented, non-
compliance with the call conditions, submission of false information, failure to
provide required information, breach of ethics, values or security rules, etc) —
either during the award procedure or under the Grant Agreement
Examples:
1. False declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding
2. Based on information received from a third party, the granting authority suspects that
the beneficiary and the person who has powers of control towards the beneficiary are in
breach of EU values. The information received indicates that public statements which are
discriminatory and incite to hate towards women have been made by the person who
controls the beneficiary. The granting authority suspended the Grant Agreement
implementation until it confirmed that the allegations were not supported by reliable
evidence.
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also suspend the action, if a beneficiary (or one of its
person having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or one of its
person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations in other
grants, if:
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systematic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other Grant Agreements
signed by the audited beneficiary. The granting authority may suspend the audited
beneficiary’s part of the action until the issue is resolved.
291EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ If provided in the Grant Agreement: the linked action (see Article 3) has not
started as specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute
and this impacts the implementation of the action under the Grant Agreement.
▪ Depending on the programme and on the type of action, there may be other
specific grounds for suspension of the Grant Agreement by the granting
authority, for example:
− major delays (CEF, RENEWFM, JTM)
− loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost scientific or technological relevance.
Example: A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered
material is selected. After the action starts, a European scientific publication
demonstrates that this material contains a chemical substance that irremediably
harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot continue and the granting
authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
− loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its economic relevance
− loss of relevance as being part of a given portfolio (HE-challenge-
based EIC Pathfinder actions and Missions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially
selected.
− change of humanitarian context no longer allows the
implementation of the action (HUMA)
− suspension or termination of the cooperation or of the Financing
Agreement with the partner country in which the project takes
place (RELEX)
− change of partner country policy environment (RELEX).
Specific cases (GA suspension by the EU):
Loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE) — The granting authority may suspend
the action, if it needs time to assess whether the action has lost scientific or technological
relevance. This may in particular be the case:
− if a complete revision of Annex 1 is necessary to assess the impact of a request for
amendment
− if work has significantly deviated from the original work plan
− if a key beneficiary leaves the action and the consortium needs time to find a
replacement
− after a check, audit or review of the action.
Example: There are technical problems with implementing the work under an action as
described in Annex 1, so the consortium proposes changes to the work to be carried out. This
may jeopardise its technological relevance and the granting authority decides to suspend its
implementation and to carry out a review.
292EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions) — The granting authority may suspend the
action, if the action has lost its economic relevance.
Loss of relevance as being part of a portfolio (HE-challenge-based EIC Pathfinder actions
and Missions) — The granting authority may suspend the action, if the action has lost its
relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially selected.
2. Procedure
How? Before suspending the Grant Agreement, the granting authority will follow a
contradictory procedure to give the consortium the possibility to submit observations.
Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator of its intention (and the reasons
why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator has 30 days to submit observations. An extension may be
granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
If possible, the granting authority will give an estimation of how long the suspension will be
needed.
3. Effects
The suspension starts the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date
specified in the confirmation notification).
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are
NOT eligible (see Article 6.3). Eligible costs may again be incurred and declared for the
action, once the suspension is lifted.
If the action can be continued, the granting authority will lift the suspension and inform the
coordinator (together with the suspension end date).
The suspension can be lifted retroactively (i.e. back to the date when the problem
stopped/issue was clarified).
The coordinator must then request an amendment to the Grant Agreement (see Article 39),
to set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date) in the tools and adapt the
grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the action duration modifying Annexes 1 and 2,
updating the reporting periods).
If the action (or part of it) can NOT be continued, the Grant Agreement (or a beneficiary’s
participation) may be terminated.
If the suspension leads to the Grant Agreement termination, NO further costs (incurred after
the date of suspension) can be declared, except the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1).
Ineligible costs will be rejected. The grant may be reduced, if the termination is based on
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations (for instance if the
action has not been implemented properly; see Article 28). In certain cases, the granting
authority may also impose administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion and/or financial penalties;
see Article 34).

General > Article 32.1 — GA termination by consortium
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the date of the
submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify termination, it may
consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a periodic report (for
the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of the report
submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented before the
end of work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after the end of work are
not eligible.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and contributions which
are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no costs/contributions if no periodic
report was ever approved).
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and security), 16
(IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and
investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 41 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
1. GA termination (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries have the right to terminate the Grant Agreement.
GA termination should be a last-resort measure, if all efforts to continue the action fail.
If the action implementation just becomes temporarily impossible or excessively difficult, it
may be better not to terminate the grant, but to suspend it (see Article 31). In this case, the
Grant Agreement would only be terminated if it turns out later that implementation cannot be
resumed anymore.
294EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: A fire devastates premises where most of the technical equipment and computers used in
the action are stored. If the beneficiaries consider that the premises can be replaced and the action
will still be correctly implemented, they may suspend implementation and resume it when the new
laboratory is operational. However, if the action has been suspended and it is not possible to find
new premises and therefore it is impossible to resume the action, the beneficiaries may terminate
the Grant Agreement.
Grounds for GA termination (by the Consortium):
▪ Any ground that justifies early termination of the action
The beneficiaries may terminate the Grant Agreement in principle on any ground
— as long as there is a good reason (e.g. circumstances make its implementation
impossible or excessively difficult; loss of the action’s scientific or technological
relevance; force majeure).
Even if there are no legitimate reasons for discontinuing the action, the granting authority
can NOT oppose, but termination will be considered improper.
Improper termination of the Grant Agreement may lead to a grant reduction (see
Article 28).
This will be the case, for instance, if:
− the implementation of the action has become impossible or excessively difficult due to
the beneficiaries’ wilful misconduct or gross negligence
− the reasons provided are based on changes in the strategic choices of the
beneficiaries, not linked to any specific economic or operational difficulties
− implementation would have been possible if the beneficiaries had made more (but still
reasonable) efforts.
Example: The beneficiaries decide to terminate the Grant Agreement due to internal
communication and decision-making problems within the consortium, and notify the granting
authority via the coordinator. The granting authority considers that these internal problems have
jeopardised the action’s implementation, but do not justify terminating the Grant Agreement
because they could have been solved within the consortium on the basis of the consortium
agreement. This improper termination may lead to a grant reduction.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the granting authority beforehand, to discuss
the termination and possible alternatives.
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
− the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request. Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
3. Effects
295EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit the necessary reports (i.e. a periodic
report for the open reporting period until termination).
If the coordinator fails to submit the reports (within the 60 days of the date on which
termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial report
will NOT be taken into account when the final grant amount is calculated. The granting
authority will NOT send a reminder and will NOT extend the deadline.
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and the payment of the balance
(see Article 22).
If the total amount of earlier payments (pre-financing payment and interim payments, if any)
received before termination:
− is greater than the final grant amount, the balance is negative and will take the form
of a recovery (see Article 22.2)
− is lower than the final grant amount, the granting authority will pay the balance (see
Article 22.3.4).
Only costs incurred before the end of work date (i.e. generating event before the end of work
date; see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:
− costs for the reports (see Article 6.1)
Example: The action’s duration is 36 months. The starting date is 01.01.2022. The notified end
of work date is 01.05.2023. Therefore, only costs incurred in connection with the action from
1.1.2022 to 1.5.2023 (16 months) and the costs related to submission of the periodic report for
the last reporting period are eligible
− costs for (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before the end of work date
(see Article 6.1).
Example: One of the beneficiaries of the Grant Agreement has a contract to carry out 8 tests
during the action’s duration. However, only three tests out of 8 are carried out before the end of
work date. Therefore, only the costs related to these 3 tests carried out before the end of work
date may be eligible for the action.
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
Termination has NO effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action.
Obligations that continue to apply after GA termination:
▪ Keeping records and other supporting documentation (see Article 20)
▪ Submitting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination)
(see Articles 32.1.2 and 21.2)
▪ Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (e.g.
for checks, reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact;
see Articles 25 and 26)
▪ Complying with the rules on management of intellectual property, background and
results (see Article 16 and Annex 5 > IPR)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security)
▪ Complying with the security obligations (if applicable) (see Article 13 and Annex 5
> Confidentiality and security)
296EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Promoting the action and giving visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17 and
Annex 5 > Communication, dissemination and visibility)
▪ No assignment of claims for payment (see Article 42)

General > Article 32.2 — Beneficiary termination by consortium
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, on request of
the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the date of the
submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment request must
be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify termination, it
may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until
termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial statement, the
explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on the financial statement
(CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed (e.g.
reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary; addition of a
new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the report submitted
and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented before the end of
work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after the end of work are not
eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next reporting
period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the deadline, it
will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
298EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is amended to
introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into question the
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the grant may be
terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant termination (see Article
32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews,
audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 41 (assignment of
claims)) continue to apply.
1. Partner termination (by the Consortium)
What? The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of the partners (or several),
if:
− the partner concerned can no longer participate or
− the consortium has decided to change the partner (in accordance with the internal
decision-making procedures). In this case, the consortium must inform the beneficiary
concerned, request the beneficiary’s opinion in writing and provide it to the granting
authority (or — if the beneficiary didn’t reply — provide proof that the beneficiary’s
opinion has been requested in writing).
Grounds for partner termination (by the Consortium):
▪ Any ground that justifies termination of the participation of the beneficiary
The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of their consortium
members in principle on any ground — as long as there is a good reason (e.g.
withdrawal by a beneficiary because due to a change in ownership; the beneficiary
cannot implement its tasks in the same way; bankruptcy).
If there are no legitimate reasons, the granting authority will NOT oppose beneficiary
termination, but it will be considered improper.
Improper termination of the participation of a beneficiary may lead to grant reduction
(see Article 28) or even grant termination (see Article 32.3).
Termination extends to affiliated entities. Affiliated entities cannot participate in the action
without the beneficiary they are linked to, therefore, terminating a beneficiary’s participation
implies that its affiliated entities may NOT continue participating in the action.
Best practice: Partner terminations should always be first discussed within the consortium, to
make sure that everybody agrees. In case of conflicts, they should be resolved in accordance
with the consortium agreement. The granting authority will not get involved in internal
disputes; it is the coordinator’s responsibility to handle partner terminations correctly.
299EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For beneficiaries that are involved in several EU Grant Agreements, withdrawal from one
Grant Agreement does NOT necessarily imply that it has to also withdraw from the others.
Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or the
coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority. Late information will be considered
as a breach of the information obligation under the Grant Agreement (see Article 19.4).
2. Procedure
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the granting
authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
− the date the beneficiary ends working on the action (‘end of work date’)
− the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request. Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
3. Responsibility
NO amendment is needed if the termination takes effect after the end of the action (and
before payment of the balance) — unless it concerns the coordinator (since the coordinator
has many obligations also after the end of the action, e.g. submit the reports, receive the
payment of the balance and distribute the payment among the beneficiaries).
If it is rejected, the beneficiaries will have to make another proposal to the granting
authority. If a satisfactory solution cannot be found (i.e. the request for an amendment calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of the equal treatment
of applicants), the Grant Agreement may be terminated.
Example: A key beneficiary terminates its participation in the Grant Agreement. The consortium
cannot find a proper replacement and the granting authority therefore considers that the action
cannot be continued in the way for which it was originally awarded the grant.
If the amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Grant Agreement must also be
amended to introduce the necessary changes (including, if necessary, the replacement with
new beneficiaries).
4. Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit the following:
− a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
− a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate
on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
− a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with the other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary;
addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of
coordinator, etc.).
300EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Best practice: If possible, the two amendments should be combined and done
together.
In case of coordinator termination, the reports must be submitted by the new
coordinator (to avoid problems with the payment). If the nomination of the new coordinator
takes more time, the 60 days deadline may be extended.
The information contained in the beneficiary’s termination report must also be included in the
periodic report for the next reporting period.
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the terminated beneficiary:
− if the granting authority owes amounts to the beneficiary, those amounts will be paid
with the following payment to the consortium (interim or final)
− if the beneficiary owes, those amounts must be paid back to the consortium.
Only costs incurred before the end of work date (i.e. generating event before the end of work
date see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:
− costs for the termination report (see Article 6.1)
− costs for (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before the end of work date
(see Article 6.1).
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 60 days of the date on
which termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial
report will NOT be taken into account when the contribution is calculated. The granting
authority will NOT send a written reminder and will not extend the deadline.
If the coordinator fails to submit the report on the distribution of payments, the beneficiary
whose participation was terminated will NOT have to repay any amounts to the consortium.
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the Grant Agreement may be terminated (see Article 32).
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action (see Article 32.2). If the second request for amendment is accepted by the
granting authority, the Grant Agreement is amended to introduce the necessary changes (see
Article 39).
If the Grant Agreement continues (i.e. it is amended), the remaining members of the
consortium (and any new beneficiaries) have the responsibility for fully implementing the
action as described in Annex 1 (see Article 7). They must carry out the action (including the
part that the defaulting beneficiary was supposed to carry out and without any additional
funding to do so).
Specific cases (partner termination by the Consortium):
Termination of the coordinator without its agreement — The decision to terminate the
coordinator must be made by the rest of the consortium (according to its internal decision-
making procedures). The notification and amendment request must be made by one of the
beneficiaries (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries; see Article 39) and the reports must
be submitted by the new coordinator (to avoid problems with the payment). If needed, the
60 days deadline for submission of the reports can be extended (see above).
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — In principle the
coordinator must be changed. If the coordinator can no longer submit the request, the same
301EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
procedure as for coordinator termination without its agreement should be used (see above
and Article 39).

32.3.2 Procedure
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will send a
pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the
observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will take effect (confirmation
letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also inform the
coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a later date specified
in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a periodic
report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of the
report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities
implemented before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination are not eligible.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator may not
submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and contributions
which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no costs/contributions
if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 28) or to
impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority (see Article
33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks,
reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and
41 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
304EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on
the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed (e.g.
reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated beneficiary;
addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary; change of
coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the report
submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities implemented
before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only
after termination are not eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next
reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is amended to
introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into question the
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the grant
may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality
and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 41 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
1. GA or beneficiary termination (by the EU)
What? The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement or the participation of one
(or more) of the beneficiaries, on the grounds listed in this Article.
Beneficiary termination may lead to GA termination, if the granting authority considers
that following such beneficiary termination, the necessary changes to the Grant Agreement
(and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision awarding the grant or
breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants (see Article 32.3.1(c)).
Grounds for termination (by the EU):
▪ Non-accession to the Grant Agreement
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if one (or more)
beneficiaries did not accede to the Grant Agreement (i.e. did not sign the
305EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Accession Form within 30 days after the entry into force of the Grant Agreement or
did not provide the requested declaration on joint and several liability).
Non-accession of a beneficiary does NOT automatically lead to the Grant
Agreement termination; the consortium can find an alternative solution that
ensures the proper implementation of the action without the beneficiary (and
request an amendment; see Article 39).
In this case, the granting authority will terminate the Grant Agreement only if it
considers the solution inappropriate or if the consortium no longer complies with
the eligibility conditions set out in the call conditions (e.g. the rules
regarding the minimum number of beneficiaries, their legal situation, or their place
of establishment).
▪ Change in a beneficiary’s situation
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if there
has been a change to its (or one of its affiliated entities) legal, financial, technical,
organisational or ownership situation, that is likely to substantially affect or delay
the action’s implementation or calls into question the decision to award the grant.
Such changes can be of any kind and can be triggered by the beneficiary itself or
outside circumstances.
Examples (termination):
1. Beneficiary R moves from Europe to Australia and becomes no longer eligible for
receiving EU funding under the programme. Since participants must comply with the
eligibility conditions throughout the duration of the action, this would be a change that calls
into question the decision to award the grant and the granting authority may decide to
terminate the beneficiary’s participation in the Grant Agreement (or the entire Grant
Agreement if the other beneficiaries fail to find a solution to replace it).
2. An action’s key beneficiary is taken over by a non-European company (not entitled to
participate due to security reasons). This substantially affects the action implementation
and the ownership, protection, exploitation and dissemination of the results. The granting
authority decides to terminate the beneficiary’s participation (or the Grant Agreement as a
whole if the other partners fail to find a replacement).
3. A beneficiary becomes subject to EU restrictive measures (or other public law measures
that prohibit the granting authority from providing funding). This means that the beneficiary
is no longer eligible for funding and the granting authority may decide to terminate its
participation (or the Grant Agreement if no other solution can be found).
4. An SME participating as a beneficiary in a grant is acquired by another company.
Following the change of ownership, the beneficiary exceeds the ceilings of the SME
definition and loses its SME status. As one of the awarding conditions to participate in that
mono-beneficiary grant is to be a single start-up or an SME, the change of status calls into
question the decision to award the grant and the Granting Authority decides to terminate
the Grant Agreement.
Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of change of situation that
entails loss of eligibility, e.g. change of ownership, relocation date, etc (see Article 6).
Loss of eligibility may lead to termination by the EU. However, in most cases, the
granting authority will simply ask the consortium to replace the partner by amendment or to
change the partner’s role to associated partner, etc.
▪ Grant Agreement cannot be amended after termination of a beneficiary’s
participation
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if it cannot be
amended after termination of a beneficiary’s participation because the necessary
306EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
changes to the Grant Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of the equal treatment of applicants; see Article 39).
The Grant Agreement may be directly terminated if beneficiary termination
would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
▪ Action can no longer be implemented
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if action
implementation is prevented by force majeure or the action implementation is
suspended and resumption is not possible or the necessary amendment is not
acceptable (see Articles 31 and 39).
Example:
1. A fire devastates premises where most of the technical equipment and computers with
the action’s data are stored. The coordinator suspends the action’s implementation to
rebuild the premises. The granting authority carries out a review after the force majeure
takes place and concludes that the consortium can no longer implement the action. It
therefore decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
2. A beneficiary that has the necessary background to work on the action and owns the
installations where most of the work would be implemented decides to terminate its
participation. The granting authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement because the
remaining consortium cannot continue implementing the action in the same way without
this beneficiary. Continuing the action in a different way then originally evaluated and
ranked would call into question the decision awarding the grant.
▪ Bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors,
suspension of business activities or other similar proceedings
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it is
declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts,
has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities,
or is subject to any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law
(since this normally implies that the beneficiary cannot carry out the work
properly).
Example: A coordinator informs the granting authority that a beneficiary participating in a
Grant Agreement is insolvent. It does not notify beneficiary termination because it thinks
that the beneficiary may continue implementing the action. The granting authority considers
that the beneficiary has not sufficient means to pursue implementation and terminates the
beneficiary’s participation.
Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or
the coordinator must immediately inform the granting authority. Late information will be
considered as a breach of the information obligation under the Grant Agreement (see
Article 19.4).
▪ Non-compliance with tax or social security obligations
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it has
not fulfilled its obligations to pay social security contributions or taxes under
applicable national law (i.e. the law of the country in which it is established and
those of the country(ies) where the action is implemented; see Article 11.1).
Example: A national administration notifies to the granting authority that a beneficiary did
not pay social security contribution for its employees. If this beneficiary cannot prove that it
paid these contributions or clarify the situation within a given deadline, the granting
authority may terminate its participation in the Grant Agreement. If the beneficiary declared
personnel costs including amounts for social security contributions not actually incurred, the
granting authority may furthermore recover any undue amounts.
▪ Grave professional misconduct
307EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
one of its persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or
one of its persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been
found guilty of grave professional misconduct (proven by any means).
‘Grave professional misconduct’ is defined as any type of unacceptable or improper
behaviour in exercising one’s profession, especially by employees, including grave
professional misconduct within the meaning of Article 138(1)(c) of the EU Financial
Regulation 2024/250947 (see Article 2).
According to Article 138(1)(c) of the Financial Regulation, a person or entity is
guilty of grave professional misconduct when it has violated applicable laws or
regulations or ethical standards of the profession to which the person or entity
belongs, or by having engaged in any wrongful conduct which has an impact on its
professional credibility where such conduct denotes wrongful intent or gross
negligence. Therefore, one of the following conditions needs to exist in order for a
conduct to be qualified as grave professional misconduct:
− the entity has violated applicable laws or regulations or ethical standards of
the profession to which it belongs or
− the entity had a wrongful conduct which has an impact on its professional
credibility and the conduct denotes wrongful intent or gross negligence.
The examples given in Article 138(1)(c) FR cover, in particular, violation of ethical
standards of the profession, wrongful conduct with impact on professional
credibility, breach of generally accepted professional ethical standards, false
declarations/misrepresentation of information, participation in a cartel or other
agreement distorting competition, violation of IPR, attempting to influence
decision-making processes by taking advantage, through misrepresentation, of a
conflict of interests, or to obtain confidential information from public authorities to
gain an advantage and incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence or similar
activities contrary to the EU values where negatively affecting or risking to affect
the performance of a legal commitment.
The concept of 'professional misconduct' covers “all wrongful conduct which has an
impact on the professional credibility of the operator at issue and not only the
violations of professional ethical standards in the strict sense of the profession to
which that operator belongs, which are established by the disciplinary body of that
profession or by a judgment which has the force of res judicata"48.
Examples:
1. A legal entity’s participation in a Grant Agreement is terminated when a national
investigation uncovers that it falsified the results of its clinical studies.
2. A non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless of religious or
political background released controversial statements of anti-Semitic nature, in particular
by calling to destroy country X. Expressing the wish to destroy country X was considered a
conduct which has an impact on the integrity and professional credibility of the organisation
and represents a breach of the generally accepted professional ethical standards and of EU
values. The organisation participation in the Grant Agreement was terminated on the
ground of grave professional misconduct.
▪ Fraud, corruption or other criminal activities
47 [old Financial Regulation: Article 136(1)(c) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
48 See Judgment of 13 December 2012, Forpostą SA and ABC Direct Contact sp. z o.o. v Poczta Polska SA, C-
465/11, ECLI:EU:C:2012:801.
308EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
one of its persons having powers of representation, decision-making or control, or
one of its persons essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has
committed fraud, corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money
laundering or any other illegal activity.
Example: A legal entity’s participation in several EU projects is terminated when its owner
is convicted by national courts to have participated in large-scale drug trafficking.
▪ Circumvention of fiscal, social or other legal obligations in the country of
origin
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or
entities having powers of representation, decision-making or control) was created
under a different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social or other
legal obligations in the country of origin (or one of its persons having powers of
representation, decision-making or control, or one of its persons essential for the
award/implementation of the grant created an entity with this purpose).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in this grant)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement or the participation of
a beneficiary, if a beneficiary (or one of its persons having powers of
representation, decision-making or control, or one of its persons essential for the
award/implementation of the grant) has committed substantial errors,
irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations (e.g. the action has not been
properly implemented, non-compliance with the call conditions, submission of false
information, failure to provide required information, breach of ethics, values or
security rules, etc) — either during the award procedure or during the action.
Examples:
1. False declarations in the proposal form; coordinator does not transfer payments to the
other beneficiaries, or beneficiaries do not pay their subcontractors; coordinator does not
submit the reports or information (despite a reminder); consortium does not inform the
granting authority about the receipt of a second grant for the same/similar proposal; review
shows that action does not achieve its critical objectives and is way behind schedule and
consortium submits a short-term implementation plan that is not acceptable; audit shows
that beneficiary declared costs based on fake invoices; a check shows that reports
submitted by the consortium were almost entirely copied from the web (plagiarism);
consortium does not submit an amendment request after beneficiary termination
2. A legal entity’s participation in a Grant Agreement is terminated when the granting
authority checks uncovers that the entity made a public speech inciting to hate and
discrimination (breach of obligation to respect EU values in Article 14).
▪ Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations
(in other grants)
The granting authority may also terminate the Grant Agreement, if a beneficiary
(or one of its person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or one of its person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has
committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of
obligations in other grants, if
− the other grants were awarded under similar conditions (i.e. same or
similar rules applicable) and
− the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations
are:
− systemic or recurrent and
− have a material impact on this grant.
309EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: During an audit of other grants, the granting authority detected systematic
irregularities in the calculation of personnel costs that appear intentional and also affect all
other Grant Agreements signed by the audited beneficiary. The granting authority may
terminate the participation of the audited beneficiary in the Grant Agreement.
▪ Non-removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner
The granting authority may terminate the participation of a beneficiary if it refuses
to remove one of its affiliated entities or an associated partner which is in one of
the following situations:
− bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors,
suspension of business activities or other similar proceedings;
− grave professional misconduct
− non-compliance with tax or social security obligations
− fraud, corruption or other criminal activities
− substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations (in
this grant or other grants).
▪ If provided in the Grant Agreement: the linked action (see Article 3) has not
started as specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can no longer contribute,
and this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement
▪ Depending on the programme and on the type of action, there may be other
specific grounds for termination of the Grant Agreement by the granting
authority, for example:
− major delays (CEF, RENEWFM, JTM)
− loss of scientific or technological relevance (HE)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost scientific or technological relevance.
Example: A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered
material is selected. After the action starts, a European scientific publication
demonstrates that this material contains a chemical substance that irremediably
harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot continue and the granting
authority decides to terminate the Grant Agreement.
− loss of economic relevance (HE-EIC actions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its economic relevance
− loss of relevance as being part of a given portfolio (HE-challenge-
based EIC Pathfinder actions and Missions)
The granting authority may terminate the Grant Agreement, if the action
has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for which it has been initially
selected.
− change of humanitarian context no longer allows the
implementation of the action (HUMA)
− suspension or termination of the cooperation or of the Financing
Agreement with the partner country in which the project takes
place (RELEX)
− change of partner country policy environment (RELEX).
310EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Before terminating (the Grant Agreement or a beneficiary’s participation), the granting
authority may first suspend the Grant Agreement (see Article 31.2), to try to fix the problems
and re-establish compliance with the Grant Agreement. In this case, it will only terminate
(the Grant Agreement or a beneficiary’s participation) if the action cannot be resumed.
2. Procedure
How? Before GA or beneficiary termination, the granting authority will follow a contradictory
procedure to give the consortium/beneficiary the possibility to submit
observations.Contradictory procedure:
Step 1 — The granting authority informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its
intention (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.
Step 2 — The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days to submit observations. An
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30
days.
Step 3 — The granting authority analyses the observations and either stops the
procedure or confirms it.
Depending on the situation and type of termination, this procedure will be directed either at
the coordinator or the beneficiary concerned:
− terminations linked to the consortium (e.g. grant termination after a negative project
review): normally the coordinator
− terminations linked to a beneficiary (e.g. beneficiary termination or simultaneous
termination of grants after a beneficiary audit): normally the beneficiary concerned.
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must inform the other beneficiaries, via its
usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc.) and
ask for their comments.
If it is directed at the beneficiary concerned, the granting authority will inform coordinator
later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality).
If a beneficiary is terminated on the basis of Article 32.3.1(e) (i.e. bankruptcy or similar), the
granting authority will also contact the liquidator/administrator (— as soon as possible after
the termination is confirmed).
Information obligation — Beneficiaries should inform their coordinator since beneficiary
termination always has a significant impact on the action (see Article 19), likely requiring a
redistribution of tasks and budget.
3. Effects
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’): Terminations cannot be retroactive
(notably to be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination).
The effects of Grant Agreement termination are the same as when the beneficiaries terminate
the Grant Agreement (see Article 32.1.2).
Only costs incurred before termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date;
see Article 6.1(a)) are eligible. Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after
termination are NOT eligible.
Ineligible costs will be rejected. The grant may be reduced, if the termination is based on
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations (for instance if the
action has not been implemented properly; see Article 28). In certain cases, the granting
311EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
authority may also impose administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion and/or financial
penalties; see Article 34).
The detailed calculations are described in Article 22.
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of
the action (see Article 32.3.3).
Obligations that continue to apply after GA termination:
▪ Keeping records and other supporting documentation (see Article 20)
▪ Submitting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination)
(see Articles 32.3.3 and 21.2)
▪ Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (e.g.
for checks, reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact;
see Articles 25 and 26)
▪ Complying with the rules on management of intellectual property, background and
results (see Article 16 and Annex 5 > IPR)

SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND
ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS
General > Article 33 — Liability for damages
ARTICLE 33 — LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to third parties as a
consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross negligence.
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the beneficiaries or other
participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement.
1. Liability for damages (of the EU)
When signing the grant, the beneficiaries agree that the granting authority can NOT be held
liable if — in implementing the Grant Agreement — the granting authority (or its
staff/representatives) cause damage to a beneficiary or third party.
Moreover, the granting authority can NOT be held liable if — in implementing the Grant
Agreement — a beneficiary or third party involved in the action causes damage to another
beneficiary or third party.
Examples:
1. An experiment carried out by a beneficiary leads to an accidental escape of pollutants into the
local river.
2. A fire breaks out in a beneficiary’s laboratory in the course of an experiment for the action
conducted during an audit by the granting authority.
Subsidiary (secondary) liability is also excluded.
The granting authority is also not liable for damages caused by other participants involved in
the action (i.e. affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors and recipients of
financial support to third parties (FSTP)).
313EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a result of the
implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full compliance with the
Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.
The liability does not extend to indirect or consequential losses or similar damage (such as loss of profit, loss
of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by wilful act or by a breach of
confidentiality.
1. Liability for damages (of the Consortium)
What? If by implementing the action (or by not implementing the action as agreed) a
beneficiary causes damage to the granting authority, intentionally or as a result of gross
negligence, the granting authority may claim compensation.
Examples:
1. Costs of legal proceedings borne by the granting authority.
2. At a meeting on the granting authority’s premises, a beneficiary smokes and causes a fire.
2. Procedure
How? For liability cases, the granting authority will follow the normal procedure for damages
claims (i.e. bringing an action for contractual damages before the EU courts (General Court)).

General > Article 34 — Administrative sanctions and other measures
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as preventing the adoption of administrative sanctions (i.e.
exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public law measures, in addition or
as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to
148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 2988/9546).
46 Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests
(OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1).
1. Administrative sanctions
What? In the framework of the EU Early Detection and Exclusion System (EDES), the
Financial Regulation 2024/2509provides that the competent EU services can take the
following measures:
− exclusion from participation in award procedures and from being selected for
implementing Union funds, when the beneficiary (or a natural or legal person who is a
member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the beneficiary, a
natural person who is essential for the award or for the implementation of the Grant
Agreement, a natural or legal person that assumes unlimited liability for the debts of
the beneficiary) is in one or more of the exclusion situations mentioned in Article 138
of the Financial Regulation49 (e.g. grave professional misconduct, breach of
obligations, fraud, corruption, irregularity, bankruptcy, etc)
− financial penalties, in the cases described in Article 142 of the Financial Regulation50
(e.g. grave professional misconduct, breach of obligations, fraud, irregularity)
− in order to reinforce the deterrent effect of the above measures, publication of the
information related to the case on the Europa website.
These measures are public law measures (not based on the Grant Agreement) and are
conditional on established facts and findings that are substantiated by reliable evidence (e.g.
OLAF reports; EPPO’s investigations; checks, audit or controls of EU services etc).
When there is only a suspicion of risk threatening the EU financial interests and the relevant
facts are not yet established, the case may be registered in the database for information, to
enable further verifications and reinforced monitoring.
Example: The representative of a non-governmental organisation campaigning for justice regardless
of religious or political background released controversial statements of anti-Semitic nature, in
particular by calling to destroy country X. Expressing the wish to destroy country X is considered a
breach of EU values (non-discrimination) and a grave professional misconduct (a conduct which has
an impact on the integrity and professional credibility of the organisation and represents a breach of
the generally accepted professional ethical standards). The organisation was excluded for a specific
duration from participation in award procedures covered by the general budget of the Union.

315EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Procedure
How? Before taking any of the administrative measures above, the competent EU service will
normally follow a contradictory procedure with the person or entity concerned to give them
the possibility to submit observations (— except if it is necessary to preserve the
confidentiality of an investigation or of national judicial proceedings).
316EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
General > Article 35 — Force majeure
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot be considered
in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement,
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control,
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants involved in the
action), and
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without delay, stating
the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force majeure and do
their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.
1. Force majeure
What? In case of force majeure, the parties will be excused from not fulfilling their
obligations (i.e. there will be no breach of obligations under the Grant Agreement and none of
the adverse measures for breach of contract will be applied).
‘Force majeure’ relates to an extraordinary event or situation that is beyond the party’s
control and that prevents it from fulfilling its obligations under the Grant Agreement.
The event or situation must be inevitable (despite the beneficiary’s due diligence, i.e. level of
care that can reasonably be expected from a beneficiary, in order to ensure the fulfilment of
its obligations under the Grant Agreement) and unforeseeable. Force majeure can NOT be
used to justify situations caused by a beneficiary’s negligence, events that could reasonably
have been anticipated or events that are inherent to the normal activity of the beneficiary
(e.g. sick leaves, strikes, technical failure, human errors, etc.).
Examples (force majeure): An earthquake, terrorist attack or volcanic eruption; delay in using
equipment due to floods in the region/country.
Examples (not force majeure): machine malfunctions, robberies; a subcontractor building a test
site goes bankrupt, labour disputes or strikes, financial difficulties, personnel issues, for example
sickness
Usually, force majeure can be evoked ONLY for the immediate impact of the situation. Once
earthquakes, extreme weather events, etc. have taken place and impact on the further
implementation of the action becomes foreseeable, the beneficiaries must adapt their planning,
take mitigation measures and take all other necessary steps to fulfil their obligations under the
Grant Agreement under the new circumstances.
317EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If force majeure entails extra costs for the implementation of the action they may be eligible
but it will normally be the beneficiaries that will have to bear them (since they were not
budgeted in the proposal and the maximum grant amount in Annex 2 cannot be increased).
If a task for the action could not be executed due to a situation of force majeure but certain
costs were incurred for that task and could not have been avoided, those costs may still be
eligible and can be charged to the action.
Example: Airline tickets bought by a beneficiary to attend a meeting related to the action. The
flight is cancelled because the air traffic is suspended due a terrorist threat, and so the beneficiary
cannot travel to the meeting. If the ticket costs fulfil the eligibility conditions set out under Article 6
of the Grant Agreement and it is impossible for the beneficiary to get those costs reimbursed (e.g
by the airline or a travel insurance) then they may be eligible, even if the beneficiary did not travel.
Force majeure may lead to Grant Agreement suspension (see Article 31) or Grant Agreement
termination (see Article 32).
How? The coordinator must immediately formally notify the granting authority (through
Portal Formal Notifications: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification).
The beneficiary concerned must quickly put in place all possible measures to limit the
damage caused by the force majeure, including measures to limit related costs.

CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
General > Article 36 — Communication between the parties
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
[OPTION 1 for eGrants:
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal in accordance with the Portal Terms and
Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if explicitly instructed otherwise by the
granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the Grant Agreement (project number and
acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and Conditions. For
naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated — before the signature of this
Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’. The role and tasks of the LEAR are
stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of sending, as
indicated by the time logs.
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the communication
is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not been accessed within 10 days
after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general principles apply
(i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with proof of delivery will be considered
to have been received either on the delivery date registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection
at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be considered in
breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Adresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is the official
mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.]
[OPTION 2 for paper grants: For grants which are not managed through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(see Data Sheet, Point 1), the specific rules set out in Annex 5 apply.]
1. Communication between the parties — Funding & Tenders Portal electronic
exchange system
319EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
All communications (information, requests, submissions, ‘formal notifications’, etc) between
the consortium and the granting authority — before and after the payment of the balance —
must be in electronic form and done directly inside the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The Funding & Tenders Portal is the European Commission platform for the single electronic
data exchange area for participants (SEDIA) under Article 150(1) of the EU Financial
Regulation 2024/250951.
The Portal offers different functions:
− viewing and changing the legal entity data in the Participant Register
− formal notifications and other actions inside the different grant management
workflows (amendments, reporting, deliverables, etc)
− contacting granting authority outside a workflow (either through the Portal Formal
Notifications Service or Messaging Service)
− where necessary, secured electronic signatures (for instance, for signing the Grant
Agreement, accession to the Grant Agreement, amendments and financial
statements).
It keeps logs of all communication and allows for delivery with proof of receipt.
All communications are recorded in the project file (with date and time). For communications
that trigger deadlines, also the date and time of access are recorded.
The use of Portal secured personalised area (‘My Area’, also called ‘electronic exchange
system’ or ‘Portal Grant Management System’) is subject to the Funding & Tenders Portal
Terms & Conditions.
Access is limited to persons with a user account and authorisation to act for the beneficiary.
For that purpose, all beneficiaries must have appointed a legal entity appointed
representative (LEAR) before signature of the Grant Agreement. Authorisation and access are
linked to user roles (e.g. LEAR, PLSIGN or PFSIGN).
Examples:
1. Only Legal Signatories (PLSIGNs) may sign the Grant Agreement and amendments.
2. Only Financial Statement Signatories (PFSIGNs) may sign the financial statements.
3. Only Primary Coordinator Contacts (PCoCos) and Coordinator Contacts (CoCo) may submit
information to the granting authority. The Primary Coordinator Contact can be changed only by the
responsible (project) officer in the back-office, while the other roles can be managed by the
participants themselves via the Portal. (In case of MSCA-IF the Supervisor identified in the proposal
becomes the PCoCo, in ERC grants the PI identified in the proposal becomes the PCoCo.)
4. Only Participant Contacts (PaCos) may submit information to the coordinator. They cannot
submit information directly to the granting authority.
5. Only the Participant Contact(s) (PaCo, or PCoCo and CoCo(s) in case of the coordinator), Legal
Signatory (PLSIGN) or Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) of the recipient beneficiary may access a
formal notification for the first time (i.e. may formally receive it).
6. Task Managers (TaMa) may only complete and save web forms and upload documents related to
their organisation’s participation in the grant. They cannot submit information to the coordinator or
the granting authority.
7. Team Members (TeMe) have read-only access to project information. They cannot complete or
save forms, nor submit information to the coordinator or the granting authority.
51 [old Financial Regulation: Article 147(1) Financial Regulation 2018/1046].
320EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
More details on My Area and access and roles in the Portal are explained in the Online
Manual > My Area.
In principle, all communications from/to the granting authority must normally go via the
coordinator — unless the Grant Agreement or other rules provide for direct communication
with the other beneficiaries (e.g. Articles 21, 25, 26, 39; OLAF Regulations No 883/2013 and
No 2185/2996).
By using the Portal, the communications will automatically fulfil the minimum conditions
set out in the Grant Agreement (i.e. that they must be made in writing and bear the number
of the Grant Agreement (project number and acronym), in order to be on record and
identifiable).
For actions that require a document upload, you should always use the forms and
templates provided on the Portal Reference Documents — unless explicitly instructed
otherwise by the granting authority.
Beneficiaries may receive notifications even after the end of the project (e.g. for audits,
impact evaluations, etc). Therefore they (and in particular their LEARs) are obliged to keep
the contact data up to date, in order to ensure that the communication channels remain
active.
The responsibility for opening notifications in time is with the beneficiaries.
Formal notifications are considered to have been accessed 10 days after they have
been sent (— even if not actually opened by the recipient, e.g. refusal of reception or
omission). Deadlines that are counted from the date of receipt are counted as of day eleven
(see Article 3.3.3 Funding & Tenders Portal Terms & Conditions).
The same is in principle valid for formal notifications after the payment of the balance —
except that the granting authority will check that the notification has actually been
accessed by the beneficiary (at any time, before or after the 10 days deadline). If it was
not accessed, the granting authority will send a second notification, this time on paper by
registered post with proof of delivery. In that case, the deadlines will start to run from the
date of receipt of the second notification.
Specific cases (Portal access rights):
Beneficiaries in bankruptcy — If a beneficiary goes bankrupt during the action, the
liquidator may be granted the necessary access rights in the Portal, in order to complete the
beneficiary’s obligations. If exceptionally necessary, the granting authority can also agree to
communication outside the Portal electronic exchange system (i.e. via registered post or e-
mails).
2. Date of communication
Communications are considered to have been sent on the date and time they are sent
through the electronic exchange system.
Communications are considered to have been received on the date and time they were
accessed. If formal notifications have not been accessed within 10 days after sending, they
will be considered to have been accessed.
Formal communications made on paper, sent by registered post with proof of delivery, are
considered to have been made on either:
− the delivery date registered by the postal service or
− the deadline for collection at the post office.
321EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The sending party cannot be considered in breach of its obligation to comply with a deadline
in case it can demonstrate that the electronic exchange system was unavailable.
3. Addresses
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
If exceptionally, the communication is on paper, the addresses are as follows:
− for communicating to the granting authority: the official mailing address indicated on
its website (or as otherwise indicated in the call)
− for communicating to beneficiaries: the legal address specified in the Portal Participant
Register.

General > Article 38 — Calculation of periods and deadlines
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7147, periods expressed in days, months or years are calculated from
the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
47 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time-limits
(OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
1. Periods in days
A period expressed in days starts on the day following the triggering event and ends at
midnight of the last day of the period.
Days are calendar days (not working days).
Example:
Under Article 21.2 and in accordance with the schedule set out in Point 4.2 of the Data Sheet, the
coordinator (or beneficiaries in mono-beneficiaries grants) must submit a periodic report within 60
days following the end of each reporting period.
The action is divided into the following reporting periods:
RP1: from 1 March 2022 to 31 August 2023
RP2: from 1 September 2023 to 28 February 2024
Therefore, the deadline of 60 days for the first periodic report starts on 1 September 2023 and ends
on 30 October 2023.
The deadline of 60 days for the second and last periodic report starts on 1 March 2024 and ends on
29 of April 2024.
2. Periods in months or years
Periods expressed in months or years end at midnight on the day with the same date as the
day on which the period started, in the last month or year of the period.
Example: Under Article 29, the granting authority may suspend the payment deadline if a request
for payment cannot be processed. The suspension takes effect on the day the granting authority
sends the notification. When the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the
granting authority to confirm if the suspension will continue. The granting authority sent the
notification for a grant payment deadline on 31 July 2023. Therefore, the suspension will have
exceeded two months on 30 September 2023.
If that day does not exist (e.g. 31 of April), the period ends at midnight of the last day of that
month (e.g. 30 of April).
Example: Under Article 25.1.2 and in accordance with the time-limit set out in Point 6 of the Data
Sheet, reviews may be started up to two years after the final payment is made. A grant’s final
payment takes place on 29 February 2023. Therefore, the two-year review period starts on 1 March
2023 and ends on 1 March 2025.

General > Article 39 — Amendments
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would call
into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in the Portal
Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries (see Annex 3). If
a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission must be done by another
beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or proof that this
opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45 days of receiving
notification (or any additional information the granting authority has requested). If it does not agree, it must
formally notify its disagreement within the same deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for
the assessment of the request. If no notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to
have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the amendment.
1. Amendments
What & When? Amendments serve to change the Grant Agreement by mutual consent of
the parties.
They are normally done at the initiative of the consortium, but they may also be initiated by
the granting authority (e.g. where errors need to be corrected; to change Annex 1 after a
review of the action, etc).
They are mandatory for all substantive or important changes to the Grant Agreement, e.g.
changes impacting the project outcome, changes that affect the description of the action in
Annex 1, etc.
325EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The general terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement that apply to all EU grants
can NOT be changed via an amendment. Only project-specific data (e.g. duration of the
reporting periods, starting date, etc.) and the options in the Grant Agreement are open to
amendments.
Moreover, amendments may NOT result in changes that — if they had been known before
awarding the grant — would have had an impact on the award decision. Those are mostly
changes that:
− involve the consortium composition and have an impact on the eligibility criteria set
out in the call conditions (e.g. minimum number or types of participants in a proposal)
− involve changes to the action and/or its budget and affect the award criteria
announced in the call conditions (e.g. the tasks in Annex 1 are changed so
substantially that the action no longer corresponds to the scope of the call for
proposals)
− breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
− do not comply with the applicable rules (e.g. Financial Regulation 2024/2509) or with
provisions of the Grant Agreement itself (e.g. amendment to subcontract tasks of the
coordinator).
Characteristics of amendments:
▪ Can only be done in writing — a verbal agreement is not binding on the parties
since EU granting authorities are bound to written format52.
▪ Enters into force after the signature by the coordinator and the granting authority
through an exchange of signatures.
▪ Takes effect on the date agreed by the parties (retroactive or in the future); if no
date is specified, on the date when the second party approves it (not retroactive).
▪ Are usually available only during the action (i.e. after the entry into force of the
Grant Agreement and before the final payment).
▪ Must normally be requested before the end of the project; in exceptional cases
amendment clauses are also open after the end of the project (e.g. change of
coordinator or change of coordinator’s bank account, in order to be able to make
the final payment).
▪ Has to be signed by persons having the same capacity to represent the legal entity
as those who signed the initial Grant Agreement.
▪ Leaves all the other provisions of the Grant Agreement which are not affected
unchanged and with continued full effect.
▪ Forms an integral part of the Grant Agreement.
▪ Has to be in line with the rules applicable to the Grant Agreement (including
applicable EU, international and national law, where relevant under the
Agreement).
52 See Article 204(1) Financial Regulation 2024/2509 [old Financial Regulation: Article 201(1) Financial Regulation
2018/1046].
326EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Cannot have the purpose or effect of making changes to the Grant Agreement
which might call into question the decision awarding the grant or result in unequal
treatment of beneficiaries or applicants.
From a strictly legal perspective, amendments are necessary whenever there is a need to
change the Grant Agreement (including changes to its Annexes).
The amendment clauses that are available in the Portal Amendment tool are called ‘AT
clauses’.
Example: If an affiliated entity ends its participation, the option in Article 8 and the Data Sheet
must be updated to set its ‘termination date’. This can be done by using amendment clause AT6.
If such changes affect the implementation of the action and require an amendment, the
granting authority will examine the situation and inform the coordinator.
Examples (change that requires an amendment):
1. Beneficiary A becomes bankrupt. It will be necessary terminate its participation and to amend
the Grant Agreement.
2. Beneficiary B moves from Europe to Australia during the action. The change of address implies
that the beneficiary becomes ineligible for funding, so the Grant Agreement will have to be
amended to terminate participation or change role to associated partner.
Example (change that does NOT require an amendment): Beneficiary D changes its name.
The update in the Portal Participant Register is sufficient; no amendment is needed.
Information obligation — Changes in the name, address, legal form and organisation type
AND changes in the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation may or may
not require an amendment (see below) — but they ALL trigger the information obligation under
Article 19.3.
Changes without any impact on the Grant Agreement normally do NOT necessarily require a
formal amendment. They are therefore sometimes done by information procedure,
sometimes by formal amendment (if simpler because an automated clause is available).
Sample list (non-exhaustive) of cases where an amendment is necessary:
▪ Addition of a new beneficiary (AT1; see Article 40.2)
What? Addition of a new beneficiary during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The new beneficiary must first register (and get validated) in the Portal Participant
Register — unless it already has a validated participant identification code (PIC).
The beneficiary’s name (and their entry date) will be updated in the Preamble and the
list of participants in the Data Sheet and the beneficiary will be entitled to submit costs
as from that date.
For the entry date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the date of signature of the Accession Form OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment.
Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the
entry date (of the new beneficiary) may be set before the termination date (of the
beneficiary that is replaced) — so that both can incur costs for a certain period.
Example: The former beneficiary ends its participation on 01.06.2021, and the new beneficiary
accedes to the Grant Agreement on 01.05.2021.
Combinations
327EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
If the new beneficiary is participating with affiliated entities/associated partners, they
will also have to be added (with effect from the same date) (AT2, AT3).
For international organisations a change of the applicable law/dispute settlement
options may be needed (AT16, AT17).
▪ Addition of an affiliated entity/associated partner (AT2, AT3; see Article 8 and
9.1)
What? Addition of a new affiliated entity/associated partner during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The new affiliated entity/associated partner must first register (and, for affiliated
entities, also get validated) in the Portal Participant Register — unless it already has a
participant identification code (PIC).
The affiliated entity/associated partner name (and their entry date) will be updated in
the list of participants in the Data Sheet and Article 8/9.1.
For the entry date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date OR the accession date
of the beneficiary OR the date of entry into force of the amendment.
If the affiliated entity/associated partner joins the action at the same time as the
beneficiary they are linked to, the starting date of participation must be the same as the
date of the new beneficiary.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
▪ Beneficiary termination (AT4; see Article 32.2)
What? Removal of a beneficiary during the action.
There is NO need to request an amendment if termination takes effect after the end of
the action (see Article 4) — unless the beneficiary concerned is the coordinator AND the
amendment is necessary for submitting the reports and distributing the payments.
There is NO more need for a separate termination notification (simplification; new for
2021-2027).
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The beneficiary’s name (and their exit and termination dates) will be updated in the
Preamble and the list of participants in the Data Sheet. The beneficiary will be entitled
to submit costs until that date.
For the exit date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the day after submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force
of the amendment.
The exit date should be the date the participant stops (or stopped) working on the
action (i.e. end of cost eligibility date).
328EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For the termination date, the choice is between a fixed date (future) after the
submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment, whichever is the latest. It is normally predefined by the exit date and
automatically fixed by the IT system.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
If the beneficiary was participating with affiliated entities/associated partners, they will
also have to be removed (with effect from the same date) (AT6, AT7).
If the coordinator is removed, the amendment will also have to propose a new
coordinator and coordinator bank account (AT11, AT12).
▪ Removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner (AT6, AT7; see Article 8 and
9.1)
What? Removal of an affiliated entity/associated partner during the action.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
If requested by the granting authority (e.g. because of audit results or an OLAF
investigation), the consortium MUST submit an amendment to remove an affiliated
entity/associated partner. If the consortium does not follow-up this request, the
beneficiary can be terminated by the granting authority (which will also remove the
affiliated entity/associated partner).
The name of the affiliated entity/associated partner (and their exit and termination
dates) will be updated in the list of participants in the Data Sheet and Article 8/9.1.
For the exit date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or future)
OR the day after submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force
of the amendment.
For the termination date, the choice is between a fixed date (future) after the
submission of the amendment request OR the date of entry into force of the
amendment, whichever is the latest. It is normally predefined by the exit date and
automatically fixed by the IT system.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
▪ Change of coordinator (AT11)
What? Replacement of the coordinator during the action (e.g. because of financial
difficulties).
This amendment clause usually remains open even after the end of the action — until
the final payment is paid out.
What not? There is NO need to request an amendment if there is only a change in the
person in charge of the coordination of the project (since the person’s name is not
mentioned in the Grant Agreement).
Information obligation — In this case you should however inform the granting
authority (see Article 19).
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
329EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The new coordinator becomes beneficiary No 1 in the Preamble and list of participants
in the Data Sheet and the handover date is added to the coordinator list in the Data
Sheet.
For the handover date, it is possible to choose between a fixed date (retroactive or
future) OR the date of entry into force of the amendment.
The handover date should be the date when the new coordinator takes over (and the
former coordinator stops acting as coordinator).
If there was a gap (former coordinator leaves before new coordinator starts; e.g.
coordinator is in bankruptcy) this will be visible in the coordinator list, since the handover
date for the former coordinator (when it stopped doing coordinator tasks) must be at the
latest its termination date.
Combinations
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT41).
The coordinator bank account will have to be changed (AT12).
If the new coordinator is not already a beneficiary of the Grant Agreement, it must
first accede to the Grant Agreement as a new beneficiary (AT1).
If the former coordinator would like to leave, its participation will have to be
terminated (AT4).
▪ Change of the coordinator’s bank account for payments (AT12)
What? An amendment is necessary for all events that imply a change of the account
number/IBAN code indicated in the Grant Agreement (see Data Sheet, Point 4).
What not? NO amendment is necessary for a change of the name of the bank or name
of the account holder; a change of the bank account data (and validation) in the Portal
Participant Register is sufficient.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
The bank account data must first be updated in the Portal Participant Register (and be
validated).
▪ Changes to Annex 1 (description of the action) (AT21)
What? Changes to the description of the action, in particular:
− significant change of the action tasks (e.g. if tasks are added/removed) or of
their division among the beneficiaries
Significant changes to the action such as removal of action tasks may put into
question the decision to award the grant. The granting authority will assess on a
case-by-case basis whether such changes are permissible.
− changes concerning eligible in-kind contributions provided by third parties free
of charge (HE) or subcontracts
Such changes could in principle also be made via simplified approval procedure
(see Articles 9.2 and 9.3); however, if the beneficiary requests an amendment,
it will immediately know if the granting authority agrees (or not). Without
amendment, this decision is left for later and the granting authority may reject
the costs as ineligible at the moment of the payment.
330EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− changes concerning the tasks to be carried out by affiliated entities and related
costs (including if an affiliated entity is removed)
− changes concerning Grant Agreement options (options are removed or added)
− significant changes concerning deliverables (e.g. adding/removing deliverables;
changes in substance of a project output which is reflected in a deliverable,
etc.).
What not? Changes to the due date of a deliverable normally do not require an
amendment.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Combinations
Annex 2 may have to be changed (AT41).
▪ Change of the starting date, project duration or reporting periods (AT24,
AT25, AT26)
What? Change of the action’s schedule (starting date, action duration or reporting
periods).
Example: The Grant Agreement for the action has a fixed starting date that is before the
date on which the Grant Agreement enters into force. Because of weather conditions, the
consortium cannot start on that date and requests the granting authority to change it.
Even if the action is prolonged, the maximum grant amount will NOT be increased.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Extensions should be requested before the action ends and must be specifically
justified.
Combinations
Annex 1 may have to be changed (AT21).
Depending on the case all three clauses may have to be used (AT24, AT25 and AT26).
▪ Changes to Annex 2 (estimated budget) and Annex 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, if
necessary (AT41, AT51, AT51a, 51b, 51c, 51d)
What? Changes to the estimated budget, in particular:
− a budget transfer between beneficiaries or between budget categories (or both)
which is linked to a significant change in the action’s work (i.e. Annex 1);
including new subcontracts (for HE, also new eligible in-kind contributions)
− a budget transfer to a form of costs that was not used by the beneficiary (i.e.
with 0 EUR costs in Annex 2) — except for transfer of amounts to budget
categories which are based on unit costs or unit contributions calculated using
the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary (e.g. budget category D.2
Internal invoices)
− a budget transfer to or from the budget category for volunteers (for
programmes with eligible costs for volunteers: ERDF-TA, LIFE, ERASMUS,
CREA, CERV, JUST, ESF/SOCPL, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
− a budget transfer to or from to budget categories based on lump sum costs or
lump sum contributions
331EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
What not? There is NO need to request an amendment for changes covered by the
budget flexibility rule in Article 5.5.
How? The amendment is normally triggered by the consortium.
Best practice: If Annex 2b or other specific cost annexes need to be changed, the
beneficiaries should contact the granting authority.
Combinations
Annex 1 may have to be changed (AT21).
2. Procedure
How? Amendment requests must be prepared by the requesting party (i.e. usually the
coordinator) directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
Best practice: In case of doubt or if none of the available amendment clauses fit,
beneficiaries should contact the granting authority, to discuss the amendment.
For the addition of new partners, the new entities (beneficiaries, affiliated entities or
associated partners) must have been registered (and beneficiaries and affiliated entities also
validated) in the Participant Register.
Examples:
1. A new beneficiary must be validated (legal entity validation). This means that the new beneficiary will have
to register in the Portal Participant Register, be validated and appoint a LEAR.
2. Validation of the new bank account, to change the bank account.
The request must be unambiguous and complete and submitted in time (i.e. sufficiently in
advance to allow proper analysis and preparation before it is due to take effect and —
generally — before the end of the action; see Article 4). Requests introduced AFTER the end
of the action will be accepted only exceptionally, for very specific and duly substantiated
cases (e.g. change of bank account, change of coordinator to make the final payment).
The coordinator must ensure that they have the agreement of the consortium (in accordance
with the internal decision-making processes, e.g. unanimity, simple or qualified majority, etc
set out in the consortium agreement; where applicable).
Once completed, the request (with all its uploaded supporting documents) must be
submitted and signed by the PLSIGN of the coordinator (on behalf of the other
beneficiaries, on the basis of the mandate given in the accession forms).
Pending amendment requests may at any moment be withdrawn (before they have been
accepted or formally rejected).
Example: The coordinator requests an amendment to change its bank account number and the
reallocation of tasks in Annex 1 and of budget in Annex 2. Since the change of bank account is
urgent because the Commission has to make the interim payment and the revision of the Annexes
may require more time, the coordinator withdraws the request and makes a new request to change
only the bank account and a second one to change the Annexes.
A request containing several changes to the Grant Agreement will be considered as one (and
must either be agreed or rejected by the other party as a whole).
If the receiving party requests additional information/documents, a new deadline will apply,
i.e. 45 days from receiving the additional information/documents.
Example: The coordinator submits a request to add a new beneficiary with several affiliated
entities (see Article 8). The granting authority requests a signed declaration for the joint and
several liability of the affiliated entities (Annex 3a). A new 45-day deadline for evaluation and
validation will apply from the moment the granting authority receives the declaration.
The other party must — within 45 days — agree or disagree.
332EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The deadline may exceptionally be extended by the receiving party, for a period to be
determined case-by-case and if necessary for the assessment of the request (e.g. a review is
needed to assess the changes).
If accepted it will be counter-signed by the receiving party directly in the Portal Amendment
tool (for the consortium: by the PLSIGN of the coordinator).
If there is no reaction within the deadline, the request is in principle considered to have been
rejected (there is NO tacit approval of amendments). A new amendment request may
however be submitted — even if it fully or partly repeats the initial request.
3. Effects
The amendment enters into force and is binding from the moment the receiving party has
agreed to it (i.e. signed in the Portal Amendment tool).
The amendment will take effect (i.e. the changes to the Grant Agreement will start to apply)
either:
− on the day of its entry into force (i.e. day of the last signature of the amendment) or
− on the specific date(s) indicated (and agreed) in the amendment.
The date should normally be after the entry into force of the amendment. In justified cases it
may — exceptionally — be before (retroactivity of the amendment). In some cases, the Grant
Agreement itself provides for retroactivity.
Examples (retroactivity allowed/foreseen in the GA):
1. Where a new beneficiary is added to the Grant Agreement (AT3), it must assume the rights and
obligations from the accession date specified in the Accession Form. If this date is before the entry
into force of the amendment, this retroactivity implies that its costs will be considered eligible as
from the accession date (and not as from the entry into force of the amendment).
2. Following a suspension of the implementation of the action by the beneficiary or by the
Commission, the suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the
amendment (AT26). This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force
(see Article 31.2.2).
3. If the amendment intends to correct an error (AT60), the change will be made with effect from
entry into force of the Grant Agreement (i.e. from the beginning).
Depending on the amendment clause, the date of taking effect may have an impact on the
eligibility of costs.
Amendment request involving several changes, may take effect on different dates.
Example: On 1 May 2022, the coordinator requests an amendment to change the bank account
and to add a new beneficiary. The addition of the beneficiary takes effect from the date of its
accession, as specified in the Accession Form (1 April 2022), while the change of bank account
takes effect on a date agreed by the parties or on the date on which the amendment enters into
force (e.g. 10 June 2022, the day it is signed by the receiving party).
Specific cases (amendments):
Budget transfers — Only the budget transfers that imply a change of Annex 2 (or one of its
Annexes 2a-2e) require an amendment. Other transfers are covered by the budget flexibility
principle and normally do NOT need an amendment (see Article 5.5).
Examples (no need for amendment):
1. During the action implementation, a beneficiary that declared its direct personnel costs as actual
costs decides to change this and instead to declare them as unit costs in accordance with its usual
accounting practices (average personnel costs), which is allowed in its Grant Agreement.
2. An SME joins an on-going GA. The SME owner does not have a salary but incorrectly budgets its
costs as actual personnel costs (category A.1). She realises the mistake and then switches to the
unit costs for SME owners (category A.4); which is allowed in her Grant Agreement.
333EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Change of name, address or other legal entity data (of beneficiaries/affiliated
entities) — Changes to participant legal data normally do NOT require an amendment.
Simple changes of name, legal form (e.g. Ltd., S.A.), official registration number, address,
VAT number do NOT require an amendment. An update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR
(and validation) in the Portal Participant Register is normally sufficient.
If (exceptionally) the granting authority considers that the registered change affects the
implementation of the action, it will inform the coordinator (and instruct them to request an
amendment, if needed).
Example: Company R moves from Europe to Australia and this implies that the beneficiary is no
longer eligible for EU funding. In such a case, the coordinator will be asked to make an amendment
to the Grant Agreement to exchange the beneficiary or to change its role into ‘associated partner’.
Short names have no legal value and only serve as easy identifiers in the Grant Agreement.
If needed, they can be changed through an amendment (AT15).
A change of the person that represents the coordinator for the purposes of signing the Grant
Agreement requires NO follow-up at all (not even a change in the Portal Participant Register
— since the contact information there is only relevant at the moment of Grant Agreement
signature (not afterwards).
Beneficiary termination due to non-accession — The amendment will have ex tunc effect
(as from the beginning of the action and Preamble, list of participants in the Data Sheet and
Article 8 and 9.1 will be adapted to reflect that the beneficiary (and its affiliated
entities/associated partners) had never joined.
Change of roles — Participant changes that involve the switching of roles are now all done
through so-called ‘in/out amendments’ (new for 2021-2027). Meaning that the entity ends its
participation with one role and starts a new participation with another role.
Be aware that there may be timing restrictions which you may have to respect in that
case (e.g. exit date in one role must be before starting date in another role).
In case of loss of eligibility (and if participation is still allowed), partners may be forced to
switch roles (e.g. from beneficiary/affiliated entity to associated partner).
Example: Beneficiary R moves from Europe to Australia and becomes no longer eligible for
receiving EU funding under the programme. Since participants must comply with the eligibility
conditions throughout the duration of the action, the Grant Agreement must be amended to change
the beneficiary or change its role to associated partner. If R is participating with an affiliated entity
M established in France, M will continue being eligible for funding, but would have to change role to
participate as beneficiary.
Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility (see Article
6). That date should therefore be used as exit date.
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — After the end of
the action, if the coordinator can continue its participation with the bank account of the
administrator/liquidator (i.e. termination and coordinator change not really needed), it will be
exceptionally sufficient to just change the bank account for payments (AT12) without
changing the coordinator.
If the coordinator ceased business operations and will not be able to continue participating in
the project, a coordinator change amendment will be needed. If the coordinator is no longer
able to submit the request for amendment (e.g. because the LEAR and all personnel with
access rights in the Portal IT tools left), the same procedure as for coordinator change
without its agreement should be used (see below).
Termination of the coordinator without their agreement — If the consortium
terminates the coordinator without its agreement, it must provide proof of its decision to
334EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
change the coordinator and nominate one of the beneficiaries to act on its behalf to request
the amendment (see Article 32 and below). Contact the EU project officer in charge of your
grant.
Partial takeovers (PTROs) — Partial takeovers (like all other transfers) are now also
handled as normal in/out amendments (there are no more special all-in-one amendment
clauses for transfers). The former participants will therefore have to submit a termination
report and their participation will be formally closed.
In view of the special status of partial takeovers, the accession forms for new beneficiaries
include a clause on joint and several liability for undue amounts paid to the beneficiary they
replace (i.e. recoveries).
Partial takeovers are transfers of a business unit as a going concern (i.e. transfers that go
beyond the simple sale of assets where a part of the business of the beneficiary — including
the Grant Agreement — is taken over by (one or more) other entity(ies), e.g. partial
acquisition, distribution of a business unit after dissolution/liquidation, division/demerger,
etc).
Partial transfers are generally very complex and their effects depend on the specific
circumstances of each case and grant contract and often also on national law.
Depending on whether the initial entity disappears or continues, there are different types of
partial takeovers:
− Partial acquisition — the original entity continues to exist, but a new entity purchases
a department, business unit, or similar (and absorbs or takes over part of the rights
and obligations of the original entity).
Thus, some of the rights and obligations (and contracts) of the original entity are
transferred to the new entity. Since the beneficiary continues to exist as a legal entity
and only some of its rights and obligations are affected, a case-by-case analysis is
needed (and an amendment therefore necessary).
Example: Company X sells its mobile phone division to company Z; all grants where the mobile
phone division of X was involved will be affected by the transfer of rights and obligations; other
grants where other divisions of company X work will not be affected.
− Distribution of a business unit on dissolution/liquidation — the original entity
disappears (due to dissolution or liquidation), but (one or more) new entities purchase
a department, business unit or similar (and absorb or take over part of its rights and
obligations).
Since only some of the beneficiary’s rights and obligations are transferred, a case-by-
case analysis is needed (and an amendment therefore necessary).
− Division/demerger — the original entity disappears and several entities replace it;
different parts of the original entity are transferred to the new entities (i.e. several
partial transfers to different entities).
Examples:
1. Company X has several ongoing grants. Company X is bought by two other companies (Y &
Z), one of which will absorb the mobile phone division and the other the remaining divisions.
For some grants there will be a transfer of rights and obligations from X to Y, for other grants it
will be from X to Z.
2. Company Ω has an ongoing grant (covering some action tasks to be implemented by its
engineering division and some action tasks to be implemented by other divisions). Company Ω
is bought by two other companies (E and O), one of which absorbs the engineering division and
the other the remaining divisions. There are two partial takeovers: one to company E and one
to company O.
335EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If the in/out amendment is due to a partial transfer, this should be clearly mentioned in the
amendment request (together with a copy of the takeover contract, a short summary of the
facts, timeline and effects of the takeover under the applicable national law and a list of the
relevant provisions with references and hyperlinks to the texts.
Universal takeovers — Transfers of the Grant Agreement linked to a universal takeover
normally do NOT require an amendment; an update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR (and
validation) in the Portal Participant Register is sufficient.
Universal takeovers are transfers where the original entity is replaced by one new entity and
all the rights and obligations — including the Grant Agreement — are transferred to this new
entity (e.g. merger or full acquisition).
Example: Beneficiary X merges with another existing entity Y by:
− becoming part of it (thus X and Y are together known as ‘Y’, and entity X ceases to exist) or
− establishing a new separate legal entity (X and Y are together known as ‘Z’).
If (exceptionally) the granting authority considers that the registered transfer affects the
action implementation, it will inform the coordinator (and instruct it to request an
amendment, if needed).
Example:
1. The legal form or type of organisation of the new entity differs from that of the former
beneficiary or affiliated entity and this has an impact on the implementation of the action.
2. The coordinator transfers all its rights and obligations to another legal entity. If this involves a
change of the bank account number in Data Sheet, each Grant Agreement in which it participates
as coordinator must be amended to update this information (AT12).
Information obligation — In case of a universal takeover, the beneficiary must — in
addition to updating the data in the Portal Participant Register— inform the coordinator via its
usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc) under
Article 19.
If a potential planned universal takeover could significantly affect or delay the implementation
of the action, the EU financial interests, the decision to award the grant or the compliance with
the Grant Agreement, the coordinator should flag this as soon as possible the granting
authority. The same applies if the universal takeover concerns an affiliated entity.

General > Article 40 — Accession and addition of new beneficiaries
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession form (see
Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry into force of the
Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of its entry into
force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must — within 30
days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and make any changes necessary
to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate
the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 39. It must
include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal Amendment
tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
1. Accession of beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
All beneficiaries (except the coordinator) must accede to the Grant Agreement by signing the
accession form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal. They must do this within 30 days after
the Grant Agreement enters into force (see Article 44). With the signature of this form, they
will assume the rights and be bound by the obligations under the Agreement with effect from
the date of its entry into force (retroactive).
Before being able to sign the accession form, each beneficiary will have to have provided
their declaration of honour (DoH) and those for its affiliated entities.
In addition, where required by the granting authority during grant preparation, the
beneficiaries concerned will have to have provided their declarations on joint and several
liability (see Annex 3a).
Affiliated entities or associated partners do not become parties to the Grant Agreement and
therefore do NOT need to sign an accession form.
The coordinator is NOT obliged to distribute hard copies of the Grant Agreement and
Accession Form to the other beneficiaries. All documents are available in the project file on
the Portal.
2. Addition of new beneficiaries (amendment)
What? In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request adding a new beneficiary.
337EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The new beneficiary must comply with the eligibility criteria of the call conditions, have
sufficient operational and financial capacity to perform the proposed tasks, comply with the
non-exclusion criteria and commit to implement the action under the same terms and
conditions as the other beneficiaries.
Mono-beneficiary grants can become multi-beneficiary grants, by addition of a new
beneficiary (new for 2021-2027).
How? The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39).
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why
− an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary.
Before, the new beneficiary must have taken all necessary steps to be able to participate as
beneficiary, i.e. register in the Participant Register and be validated — unless it already has a
validated participant identification code (PIC), provide his declaration on honour, provide a
declaration on joint and several liability of its affiliated entity (if required by the granting
authority), etc.
Effects:
The accession form must specify the accession date. It must be either:
− the date of signature of the accession form
− the date of entry into force of the amendment
OR
− a fixed date:
− either retroactive (i.e. before signature of the accession form)
OR
− future (i.e. after signature of the accession form — this should be an
exceptional case with a justification).
Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the
accession date may be set before the termination date (of the beneficiary that is replaced) —
so that both can incur costs for a certain period.

General > Article 41 — GA transfer
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the grant to a new
beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal Amendment
tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
1. GA transfers
What? In justified cases, mono-beneficiary grants may be transferred to a new beneficiary,
provided that certain conditions are complied with. Article 41 does not apply to multi-
beneficiary actions.
NO transfer can be conducted before the amendment has been accepted by the granting
authority. Transfers without a formal amendment are void and may result in grant
termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible until the granting authority has
approved the amendment.
‘Transfer’ means that the rights and obligations under the Grant Agreement are transferred
from the current beneficiary to a new beneficiary — without passing via termination (Article
32) or addition of a new beneficiary (Article 40.2).
The transfer may NOT call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants. The new beneficiary must comply with the
eligibility criteria of the call conditions, have sufficient operational and financial capacity to
perform the proposed tasks and commit to implement the action under the same terms and
conditions as the former beneficiary.
Example: The transfer will not be accepted if the new beneficiary does not fulfil the eligibility
conditions or does not have sufficient financial and operational capacity.
How? The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39) to the
granting authority.
Amendment procedure:
The amendment request must include:
− the reasons why. If the contracting authority considers that the reasons provided do
not justify the transfer, it may reject the request
339EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− the accession form in Annex 3 (i.e. the statement to take over all rights and
obligations under the Grant Agreement) of the new beneficiary (signed directly in the
Portal)
− any other supporting documents required by the granting authority.
Effects:
If the request for the transfer of the Grant Agreement to a new beneficiary is accepted by the
granting authority, the Agreement will be amended to introduce the necessary changes and
the new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations thereof.
The transfer will take effect on the day of accession specified in the accession form (see
Annex 3).

ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE GRANTING
AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting authority to any third
party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority on the basis of a reasoned, written
request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed, the assignment
will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations towards the granting
authority.
1. Assignment of claims for payment
What? The beneficiaries may assign (i.e. transfer, sell or give) claims for payment (for work
carried out under the action) to a third party, if the granting authority has explicitly approved
it in writing and on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator.
Assignment has NO effect on the beneficiary’s obligations under the Grant Agreement; it
remains fully bound by them.
‘Assignments of rights’ are limited to claims for payment under Article 22.1. Transfers of
other rights or obligations (e.g. replacement of a beneficiary by the entity that bought it) are
governed by other provisions (e.g. amendments; see Article 39).
Only actual (i.e. existing) claims for payment may be assigned (including pre-financing).
Assignment is NOT possible for future claims.
How? Assignment of payment claims must be requested to the granting authority.
The request for approval must come from the coordinator, on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned. It must be in writing and must explain the reasons for the assignment.
The granting authority will assess the reasons given and approve or reject the request in
writing. In case the granting authority does not approve the assignment or if the terms of it
are not observed, the assignment will have no effect.
Examples (reasonable requests for assignment):
1. Assignment of a claim for payment for work carried out by a research laboratory sold after the
end of the action (but before payment of the balance) by a beneficiary to another legal entity.
2. Assignment for the benefit of creditors in a bankruptcy procedure.
If the assignment is linked to bankruptcy, the approval will also be subject to compliance with
national law.

43.2 Dispute settlement
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties must bring action
before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice — under Article 272 of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of Brussels, Belgium —
unless an association agreement to the EU programme provides for the enforceability of EU court
judgements under Article 272 TFEU.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet, Point 5), the
dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in accordance with the Rules for
Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under Article 299 TFEU
(see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the General Court — or, on appeal, the
Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions against offsetting
and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European Commission (not against the granting
authority; see also Article 22).
1. Dispute settlement
As a general rule, the Grant Agreements contain an Article 272 TFEU arbitration clause —
referring contractual disputes (i.e. disputes on the interpretation, application or validity of the
Grant Agreement) to the EU Courts (General Court).
An Article 272 action is ONLY possible once the granting authority position is final (i.e.
against confirmation letters, debit notes, etc.; NOT against audit reports, audit letters, pre-
information letters, etc).
Bringing an action against the granting authority:
− for grants signed by the European Commission: actions must be brought against the
Commission
− for grants signed by an EU executive agency or other EU body: actions must be brought
against the Agency or EU body.
For disputes of public law nature (i.e. which concern administrative sanctions, offsetting or
enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU; see Articles 22 and 34) actions must be
brought before the EU courts (General Court) under Article 263 TFEU (NOT before any other
court and NOT under Article 272).
Public law measures must ALWAYS be brought to the European Court of Justice under Article
263 TFEU (including actions brought by non-EU beneficiaries).
All procedures are organised in a way that the beneficiaries will always be informed about
what they can do if they disagree (means of redress information in the letters).
Specific cases (dispute settlement):
344EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Non-EU beneficiaries — Contractual disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium. The only exception concerns non-EU beneficiaries which are for the
purpose of the action considered to be established in an associated country and where the
corresponding association agreement to the EU programme provides for the enforceability of
EU court judgments under Article 272 TFEU. In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must
bring the contractual dispute before the EU courts (General Court).
International organisations (IOs) — Are the only types of beneficiaries that can make use
of arbitration in EU grants, as a special means of disputes settlement (provided that the
option is activated in the Grant Agreement; see Data sheet).
Thus, for international organisations, contractual disputes are referred to the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (instead of the EU General Court) and EU granting authorities will
normally avoid adopting public law measures, such as enforceable decisions under Article 299
TFEU or decisions on administrative sanctions (see Article 34). Offsetting remains possible
also against international organisations (as contractual measure, see Article 22.4).

CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY (— ARTICLE 13)
[OPTION for programmes with security requirements: Sensitive information with security
recommendation
Sensitive information with a security recommendation must comply with the additional requirements
imposed by the granting authority.
Before starting the action tasks concerned, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals or other
mandatory documents needed for implementing the task. The documents must be kept on file and be
submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting authority. If they are not in English, they must be
submitted together with an English summary.
For requirements restricting disclosure or dissemination, the information must be handled in accordance with
the recommendation and may be disclosed or disseminated only after written approval from the granting
authority.]
[OPTION for programmes with EU classified information (standard): EU classified information
If EU classified information is used or generated by the action, it must be treated in accordance with the
security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter (SAL) set out in Annex 1 and Decision
2015/44449 and its implementing rules — until it is declassified.
Deliverables which contain EU classified information must be submitted according to special procedures
agreed with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving EU classified information may be subcontracted only with prior explicit written
approval from the granting authority and only to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU
country with a security of information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission).
EU classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants involved in the
action implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the granting authority.]
49 Commission Decision 2015/444/EC, Euratom of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU classified information (OJ L 72,
17.3.2015, p. 53).
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on confidentiality and security (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, EMFAF,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
Some programmes with calls that may involve sensitive or classified information (HE, DEP,
CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM) also have specific provisions on confidentiality and
security in Annex 5.
They cover sensitive information with security recommendations and EU classified
information.
347EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
2. Sensitive information with a security recommendation (HE)
For these programmes, proposals may have to undergo a security review before selection
and may, if there are security issues, be made subject to specific security recommendations.
Examples (security issues): information on gaps and vulnerabilities in existing systems or
critical infrastructures, design, characteristics and requirements of devices used in detection, law-
enforcement measures to counter terrorism, tools and methodologies for predicting and detecting
organised criminal activities, etc.
Examples (security recommendations): classification, limited dissemination, establishment
of a security advisory board, appointment of a project security officer, limiting the level of detail,
using a fake scenario, etc.
Sensitive information concerning commercial secrets, know-how, etc are NOT sensitive
information within the meaning of Annex 5. Commercially sensitive information is already
protected under Article 13.1.
The most common security recommendations concern restricted disclosure or limited
dissemination. This leads to the creation of deliverables, which are sensitive information with
security recommendation. They are listed in Annex 1 (DoA, security section). If this is the
case, third parties should have no access them. Thus, before disclosure or dissemination to a
third party, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator, who must request written approval
from the granting authority. Other security recommendations concern the appointment of
security staff (security officers, security advisory board), specific measures for access to IT
systems, etc.
Some security requirements must be taken care of before grant signature, but most are for
implementation during the grant.
In addition, beneficiaries must obtain — before the start of the action task for which they are
needed — all the necessary security approvals, opinions, notifications and authorisations
(e.g. to security committees, etc). These documents do not need to be submitted, but must
be kept on file and provided on request (e.g. in case of security checks or audits). They must
be able to show that the opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the tasks to be
undertaken in the context of the action. If the documents are not in English, they may be
asked to provide an English summary.
Best practice: When preparing the applications for approvals/opinions/notifications/
authorisations, you should request the assistance of security experts, security
departments/committees and of your organisation’s data protection officer, if relevant.
In case of changes to the security situation, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator,
which must immediately inform the granting authority and, if necessary, request for Annex 1
to be amended.
The granting authority may carry out security checks or audits, to ensure that the
beneficiaries have properly implemented the security requirements and obtained the
opinions/notifications/authorisations (see Article 25).
3. EU classified information (HE, DEP, EDF, CEF, EMFAF, AMIF/ISF/BMVI, UCPM)
Projects with EU classified information will moreover have to comply with the provisions
linked to EU classified information (see Article 13.2).
The project will have to follow a security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter
(SAL) which set out the classification-level and the measures that need to be taken to protect
the information. Both need to be added to Annex 1.
348EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Only entities listed in the security section of Annex 1 can have access to EU classified
information used or generated by the project. Before disclosure or dissemination to a third
party (including other participants involved in the action), the beneficiaries must inform the
coordinator, which must request written approval from the granting authority.
In case of changes to the security situation, the beneficiaries must inform the coordinator,
which must immediately inform the granting authority and, if necessary, request for Annex 1
to be amended.
Deliverables containing EU classified information must be submitted following the special
procedure agreed with the granting authority, as described in the programme security
instruction (PSI) (e.g. HE PSI, DEP PSI, EDF PSI, ASAP PSI).
Action tasks involving EU classified information may ONLY be subcontracted (cumulative
conditions):
− to entities established in an EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission) and
− if the granting authority has explicitly approved such requests in writing.

security-sensitive projects, Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe
projects and Guidelines on the classification of information in Digital Europe projects.

AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14) (DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
[OPTION for programmes with specific ethics rules: Ethics
Actions involving activities raising ethics issues must be carried out in compliance with:
- ethical principles [(including the highest standards of research integrity)]
and
- applicable EU, international and national law, including [the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights
and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and
its Supplementary Protocols][[other programme-specific legal acts]].
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to [the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the
right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of persons, the right to
non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the environment and high levels of human health
protection].
Before the beginning of an action task raising an ethical issue, the beneficiaries must have obtained all
approvals or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any (national or
local) ethics committee or other bodies [such as data protection authorities].
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting
authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary, which shows
that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the conclusions of the committee or
authority concerned (if any).]
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14) (HE, RFCS)
[OPTION for programmes with specific ethics and research integrity rules: Ethics and research integrity
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
- ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity) and
- applicable EU, international and nationallaw, including the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its
Supplementary Protocols.
No funding can be granted, within or outside the EU, for activities that are prohibited in all Member States.
No funding can be granted in a Member State for an activity which is forbiddenin that Member State.
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the
right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of persons, the right to
non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the environment and high levels of human health
protection.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action have an exclusive focus on civil
applications.
350EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action do not:
- aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes
- intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such modifications
heritable (with the exception of research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads, which may be
financed)
- intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell
procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or
- lead to the destruction of human embryos (for example, for obtaining stem cells).
[Activities involving research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells may be carried out only
if:
- they are set out in Annex 1 or
- the coordinator has obtained explicit approval (in writing) from the granting authority.]
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the fundamental principle of research integrity —as set out in the
European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity59.
This implies compliance with the following principles:
- reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis
and the use of resources
- honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a
transparent, fair and unbiased way
- respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the
environment
- accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organisation, for
training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts
and means that beneficiaries must ensure that persons carrying out research tasks follow the good research
practices including ensuring, where possible, openness, reproducibility and traceability and refrain from the
research integrity violations described in the Code.
Activities raising ethical issues must comply with the additional requirements formulated by the ethics
panels (including after checks, reviews or audits; see Article 25).
Before starting an action task raising ethical issues, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals or
other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any (national or local) ethics
committee or other bodies such as data protection authorities.
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting
authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary, which shows
that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the conclusions of the committee or
authority concerned (if any).

The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on ethics (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H, AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
351EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Some programmes with ethics-sensitive calls (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI) also have specific provisions on ethics in Annex 5.
Depending on the programme, the obligations may vary.
2. Ethical principles and applicable law (HE, RFCS)
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
− ethical principles (including, where applicable the highest standards of research
integrity) and
− applicable international, EU and national law.
The main ethical principles depend on the domain. For research and innovation related
domains, they are:
Main ethical principles:
▪ Respecting human dignity and integrity
▪ Ensuring honesty and transparency towards research subjects and notably
getting free and informed consent (as well as assent whenever relevant)
▪ Protecting vulnerable persons
▪ Ensuring privacy and confidentiality
▪ Promoting justice and inclusiveness
▪ Minimising harm and maximising benefit
▪ Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially if the research
is being carried out in developing countries
▪ Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction
and refinement (‘3Rs’) in animal research
▪ Respecting and protecting the environment and future generations
The key sources of EU and international law are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols (for
other texts). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (UN CRPD). In addition, some programmes mention sector-specific legislation
(such as, for instance, the EU Directives on animal health and organic-labelling for EMFAF).
3. Exclusive focus on civil applications (HE and RFCS)
For programmes with this provision (HE and RFCS), the activities under the action must have
an exclusive focus on civil applications.
This does not mean that the research results cannot peripherally be useful in a military
context. Research related to dual-use products or technologies (usually used for civilian
purposes but with possible military applications) is not prohibited (e.g. development of an
algorithm that might also be used for optimising military logistics). However, activities that
focus on military applications will NOT be funded (e.g. development of a robot designed for
military intervention).
4. Prohibited activities and activities involving research on human embryos or
human embryonic stem cells (HE)
Prohibited activities may not take place under the action.
352EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Activities that involve human embryos (hE) or human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can only
be funded, if:
− they comply with the Statement by the Commission on research activities involving
human embryos or human embryonic stem cells54 (in particular, do NOT result in the
destruction of human embryos)
and
− they are set out in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement or
− the coordinator has obtained explicit approval by the granting authority.
These activities are de facto considered as raising sensitive ethics issues and must always
undergo an ethics assessment (see below) that can lead to ethics requirements that will be
included in Annex 1.
5. Research integrity (HE and RFCS)
In order to meet the highest standards of research integrity, the beneficiaries must follow the
principles listed in this provision and ensure that the persons carrying out research tasks
comply with the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (i.e. follow the good
research practices listed in this Code and refrain from any research integrity violations it
describes).
They also must ensure that appropriate procedures, policies and structures are in place to
foster responsible research practices, to prevent questionable research practices and
research misconduct, and to handle allegations of breaches of the principles and standards in
the Code of Conduct (see Guidelines for Promoting Research Integrity in Research Performing
Organisation).
Fundamental research integrity principles:
▪ reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the
methodology, the analysis and the use of resources
▪ honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating
research in a transparent, fair and unbiased way
▪ respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural
heritage and the environment
▪ accountability for the research from the idea to publication, for its management
and organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider
impacts.
The Code constitutes a general reference framework and takes into account the legitimate
interests of the beneficiaries (i.e. regarding IPRs and data sharing). This does not change the
other obligations under this Agreement or obligations under applicable international, EU or
national law, all of which still apply.
In addition, beneficiaries should rely on local, national or discipline-specific guidelines, if such
documents exist and are not contrary to the Code.

6. Activities raising ethics issues (HE, RFCS, DEP, EDF, EMFAF, EU4H,
AMIF/ISF/BMVI)
For these programmes, proposals may have to undergo an ethics review before selection and
will, if one or more ethics issues are identified, be made subject to ethics requirements to be
solved immediately or implement during the grant. In the latter case, they will be included
as deliverables in Annex 1.
Examples (ethics issues): involvement of patients, volunteers, children or vulnerable
populations; use of human (embryonic) stem cells; implication of developing countries; collecting
and processing of personal data; use of animals; risk of environmental impact.
Examples (ethics deliverables): to submit to the granting authority a report on certain ethics
issues during the course of the action.
Examples (ethics requirements before grant signature): confirmation personal data of this
study will not be transferred outside the EU.
In addition, beneficiaries must obtain — before starting an action task raising ethical issues —
all the necessary ethics opinions, notifications and authorisations. These documents do not
need to be submitted, but must be kept on file and provided on request (in case of ethics
reviews, checks or audits). They must be able to show that the
opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the tasks to be undertaken in the context of the
action. If the documents are not in English, beneficiaries may be asked to provide an English
summary.
Best practice: When preparing the applications for such opinions/notifications/ authorisations,
beneficiaries should request the assistance of ethics experts, research ethics
departments/committees and of their organisation’s data protection officer.
The granting authority may carry out ethics checks or reviews to ensure that the beneficiaries
have properly implemented the ethics requirements and obtained the
opinions/notifications/authorisations (see Article 25).
Specific cases (ethics):
Activities carried out in a non-EU country — Such activities must comply with the laws of
that country AND be allowed in at least one EU Member State. The beneficiaries must sign
the related declaration in their application.

VALUES (— ARTICLE 14) (HE, RFCS)
[OPTION for programmes with gender rules: Gender mainstreaming
The beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities between men and women in the
implementation of the action and, where applicable, in line with the gender equality plan. They must aim, to
the extent possible, for a gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the action, including at
supervisory and managerial level.]
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on EU values (HE and RFCS)
For some programmes (HE and RFCS), Annex 5 includes specific provisions on EU values.
2. Gender mainstreaming (HE and RFCS)
The beneficiaries must take all measures:
− to promote gender equality, i.e. equal opportunities between men and women in the
implementation of the action, and
− in line with their gender equality plan (GEP), if applicable.
Promote gender equality:
The beneficiaries should:
− aim for a balanced participation of women and men in their research teams
− being proactive in ensuring gender balance among the individuals who are primarily
responsible for carrying out the work (in accordance with the categories defined in
the monitoring system)
− being proactive in promoting gender equality among consortium members and
participants in the implementation of the action.
Examples (measures to promote gender equality within a project): Transparency of
recruitment and advancement processes, including gender-sensitive language in vacancies and job-
descriptions; plans and conditions for career advancement; transparent gender equal wage
classification and grading of jobs; development of leadership opportunities; gender planning and
budgeting; gender impact assessment of policies; climate surveys of institutions; trainings on
unconscious gender biases in recruitment and assessment of researchers, as well as in
collaborative work; adoption of family-friendly policies; promotion of gender-sensitive mobility and
dual-career couples schemes; measures to prevent and address gender based violence such as
sexual harassment.
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must aim — to the extent possible —
for a gender balance at all levels of personnel assigned to the action, including at the
supervisory and managerial levels.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken and measures put in place (see Article 20).
355EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
In addition, the gender dimension should be integrated in research and innovation content.
This is a by default requirement for all Horizon Europe RIA/IA and Programme Cofund
actions, with some exceptions.
For more guidance on gender equality, including the integration of the gender dimension into
research and innovation content, see HE Programme Guide > Gender equality.
Gender equality plan:
The gender equality plan (GEP) is an eligibility criterion for participating in Horizon Europe
actions for legal entities from Member States and HE associated countries that are:
− public bodies
− research organisations
− higher education establishments.
The ‘gender equality plan’ is a document that sets out the gender equality strategy of an
organisation.
The GEP does not apply to other types of legal entities e.g. private for-profit organisations,
including SMEs, non-governmental or civil society organisations.
The GEP (or equivalent document) must cover the following minimum process-related
requirements:
− publication: a formal document published on the institution’s website and endorsed
by the top management. Endorsement can refer to the signature of the document, the
minutes of the management meeting where the decision was taken, a press release
informing about its approval or a document having a foreword and/or other form of
top management statement.
− dedicated resources: commitment of resources to implement the plan
− data collection and monitoring: regular (at least once in two years) collection of
sex/gender disaggregated data on personnel (and students, for the establishments

RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF USE (— ARTICLE 16) (DEP, EDF)
[OPTION for programmes with specific IPR rules:
Definitions
Access rights — Rights to use results or background.
357EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Dissemination — The public disclosure of the results by appropriate means, other than resulting from
protecting or exploiting the results, including by scientific [or professional] publications
in any medium.
Exploit(ation) — The use of results in further [innovation and deployment] activities other than those
covered by the action concerned, including among other things, commercial exploitation
such as developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, creating
and providing a service, or in standardisation activities.
Fair and reasonable conditions — Appropriate conditions, including possible financial terms or royalty-free
conditions, taking into account the specific circumstances of the request for access, for
example the actual or potential value of the results or background to which access is
requested and/or the scope, duration or other characteristics of the exploitation
envisaged.

The beneficiaries must, where industrial and intellectual property rights (including rights of third parties)
exist prior to the Agreement, establish a list of these pre-existing industrial and intellectual property rights,
specifying the rights owners.
The coordinator must — before starting the action — submit this list to the granting authority.
[Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to security or EU strategic autonomy reasons,
background that is subject to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not
one of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the results (i.e.
would make the results subject to control or restrictions) must not be used and must be explicitly excluded in
the list of background — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.]
[Results free from restrictions
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to [security or EU strategic autonomy reasons],
the beneficiaries must ensure that the results of the action are not subject to control or other restrictions by a
country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the
call conditions — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.]
Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them (unless the consortium agreement specifies another
ownership regime).
[For […] however, two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:
- they have jointly generated them and
- it is not possible to:
- establish the respective contribution of each beneficiary, or
- separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection.
The joint owners must agree — in writing — on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership
(‘joint ownership agreement’), to ensure compliance with their obligations under this Agreement.]
Protection of results
The beneficiaries must adequately protect their results — for an appropriate period and with appropriate
territorial coverage — if protection is possible and justified, taking into account all relevant considerations,
including the prospects for commercial exploitation, legitimate interests of the other beneficiaries and any
other legitimate interests.
[Exploitation of results

(and unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority), the beneficiaries must produce a significant
amount of products, services or processes that incorporate results of the action or that are produced through
the use of results of the action in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.
Where the call conditions impose moreover a first exploitation obligation, the first exploitation must also
take place in the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions.
The beneficiaries must ensure that these obligations also apply to their affiliated entities, associated partners,

are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless they have requested and received
prior approval by the granting authority.
The request must:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner and the planned or potential exploitation of the results and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer [or license] on the [security
interests or EU strategic autonomy].
The granting authority may request additional information.
[The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under the Agreement are passed on to the new owner
and that this new owner has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer.]

to results for policy purposes
The beneficiaries must grant access to their results — on a royalty-free basis — to the granting authority,
other EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, for developing, implementing and monitoring EU policies
or programmes. [Such access does not extend to beneficiaries’ background.]
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
[The access rights also extend to national authorities of EU Member States or associated countries, for
developing, implementing and monitoring their policies or programmes in this area. In this case, access is
subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency (including the granting
authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.]
[Access rights for the granting authority to results in case of a public emergency
If requested by the granting authority in case of a public emergency, the beneficiaries must grant non-
exclusive, world-wide licences to third parties — under fair and reasonable conditions — to use the results to
address the public emergency.]
[Access rights for third parties to ensure continuity and interoperability
Where the call conditions impose continuity or interoperability obligations, the beneficiaries must make the
[materials, documents and information] [and] [results] produced in the framework of the action available to
the public (freely accessible on the Internet under [open licences] [or] [open source licences]).]
Access rights for national authorities to the special report for use by/for armed forces or security or
intelligence forces
For Research Actions, the beneficiaries must grant access to the special report — on a royalty-free basis — to
national authorities of EU Member States or associated countries for use by/for their armed forces or security
or intelligence forces (including in the framework of cooperative programmes).
‘Special report’ means the specific deliverable summarising the results of a research project and providing
information on the basic principles, aims, outcomes, basic properties, tests performed, potential benefits,
potential defence applications and expected exploitation path of the research towards development. It may
also include information on the ownership of IPRs.
Access to the special report will be granted by the granting authority, after having ensured that appropriate
confidentiality obligations are in place.
Access rights for third parties to further develop results
For Research Actions, the beneficiaries must grant access — on a royalty-free basis — to results which are
necessary for the execution of other EU grants or contracts between national authorities of two or more EU
Member States or associated countries and one or more beneficiaries, to further develop together results
generated by the action.
In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.]

[Scope of the obligations
For this section, references to ‘beneficiary’or ‘beneficiaries’do not include affiliated entities (if any).]
[Agreement on background — Background free from restrictions
The beneficiaries must identify in a written agreement the background as needed for implementing the action
or for exploiting its results.
Where the call conditions restrict control due to strategic interests reasons, background that is subject to
control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries
or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the exploitation of the results (i.e. would

Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them.[[…]]
361EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
[However, two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:
- they have jointly generated them and
- it is not possible to:
- establishthe respective contribution of each beneficiary, or
- separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection.
The joint owners must agree —in writing —on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership

grant non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the jointly-owned results (without any right to sub-
license), if the other joint owners are given:
- at least 45 days advance notice and
- fair and reasonable compensation.
The joint owners may agree —in writing —to apply another regime than joint ownership.
If third parties (including employees and other personnel) may claim rights to the results, the beneficiary
concerned must ensure that those rights can be exercised in a manner compatible with its obligations under
the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must indicate the owner(s) of the results (results ownership list) in the final periodic
report.]
Protection of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must adequately protect their results —for an
appropriate period and with appropriate territorial coverage —if protection is possible and justified, taking
into account all relevant considerations, including the prospects for commercial exploitation, the legitimate
interests of the other beneficiaries and any other legitimate interests.
Exploitation of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must —up to four years after the end of the action
(see Data Sheet, Point 1) —use their best efforts to exploit their results directly or to have them exploited
indirectly by another entity, in particular through transfer or licensing.
[If, despite a beneficiary’s best efforts, the results are not exploited within one year after the end of the
action, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the granting authority) use the Horizon
Results Platform to find interested parties to exploit the results.
If results are incorporated in a standard, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed with the granting
authority or unless it is impossible) ask the standardisation body to include the funding statement (see Article
17) in (information related to) the standard.]
[Additional exploitation obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations (including obligations linked to the
restriction of participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons), the
beneficiaries must comply with them —up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency, the
beneficiaries must (if requested by the granting authority) grant for a limited period of time specified in the
request,non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable conditions — to their results to legal entities that
need the results to address the public emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting
products and services at fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after the end
of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
362EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Additional information obligation relating to standards
Where the call conditions impose additional informationobligations relating to possible standardisation,the
beneficiaries must —up to four years after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —inform the
granting authority, if the results could reasonably be expected to contribute to European or international
standards.
Transfer and licensing of results
Transfer of ownership
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect compliance with their
obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under the Agreement regarding their results are passed on
to the new owner and that this new owner has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer.
Moreover, they must inform the other beneficiaries with access rights of the transfer at least 45 days in
advance (or less if agreed in writing), unless agreed otherwise in writing for specifically identified third
parties including affiliated entities or unless impossible under the applicable law. This notification must
include sufficient information on the new owner to enable the beneficiaries concerned to assess the effects on
their access rights. The beneficiaries may object within 30 days of receiving notification (or less if agreed in
writing), if they can show that the transfer would adversely affect their access rights. In this case, the transfer
may not take place until agreement has been reached between the beneficiaries concerned.
Granting licences
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results (or otherwise give the right to exploit them), including on
an exclusive basis, provided this does not affect compliance with their obligations.
Exclusive licences for results may be granted only if all the other beneficiaries concerned have waived their
access rights.
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing [— Horizon Europe actions]
Where the call conditions in Horizon Europe actions provide for the right to object to transfers or licensing,
the granting authority may — up to [four][[…]] years after the endof the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) —

- [the beneficiaries which generated the results have received funding under the grant]
- it is to a legal entity established in a non-EU country not associated with Horizon Europe, and
- the granting authority considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests.
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting
authority before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation of the results,
and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU interests, in
particular regarding competitiveness as well as consistency with [ethical principles and security
considerations].
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the granting authority decides to object to a transfer or exclusive licence, it must formally notify the
beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information it has
requested).

If a beneficiary is no longer involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant access.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary no longer has
access rights.]
[Access rights for implementing the action
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —on a royalty-free basis —to background needed to
implement their own tasks under the action, unless the beneficiary that holds the background has —before
acceding to the Agreement —:
- informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is subject to restrictions, or
- agreed with the other beneficiaries that access would not be ona royalty-free basis.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access —on a royalty-free basis —to results needed for

action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).]
365EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
[Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and national authorities
to results for policy purposes [— Horizon Europe actions]
[In Horizon Europe actions,] the beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must grant access
to their results —on a royalty-free basis —to the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or
agencies for developing, implementing and monitoring EU policies or programmes. Such access rights do not
extend to beneficiaries’ background.
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
For actions under the cluster ‘Civil Security for Society’, such access rights also extend to national
authorities of EU Member States for developing, implementing and monitoring their policies or programmes
in this area. In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency (including the granting
authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.]

Undertaking Fusion for Energy for developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and
programmes or for compliance with obligations assumed through international cooperation with non-EU
countries and international organisations.
Such access rights include the right to authorise third parties to use the results in public procurement and the
right to sub-license and are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.]
Additional access rights
Where the call conditions impose additional access rights, the beneficiaries must comply with them.]
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules on IPR, background and results (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules regarding background and results and linked
intellectual property rights.
Most programmes use the standard set of additional rules concerning rights of use by the
granting authority of results for information, communication, dissemination and publicity
purposes. Some programmes (especially HE, RFCS, DEP and EDF) use more customised
provisions that may vary from programme to programme.
For Horizon Europe, the references to ‘beneficiary’ or ‘beneficiaries’ in this section do NOT
include affiliated entities. However, there are specific access rights provisions for entities under the
same control in line with the HE Regulation 2021/695 (e.g. for access rights).
2. List of background (some programmes)
366EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Programmes with actions that rely a lot on pre-existing data, know-how or information
including linked intellectual property rights, have a provision obliging the beneficiaries to
establish a so-called ‘list of background’. This list should include both background owned by
project participants and rights owned by third parties. It will allow the consortium to make
sure that everyone has the rights they need for their part of the project.
Depending on the programme, the list remains either consortium-internal or must be shared
with the granting authority (usually before starting the action).
3. Rights of use on results for information, communication, dissemination and
publicity purposes (most programmes)
Most programmes contain a provision allowing the granting authority to use results for
information, communication, dissemination and publicity purposes.
This concerns only non-sensitive information and aims mainly the communication and
dissemination activities that are part of the programme management (e.g. press
communications, stakeholder consultations, results portals, media and web-presence, etc).
4. Agreement on background (some programmes)
For some programmes, the list of background must be defined in a written agreement, in
which the beneficiaries identify and agree on what constitutes background for their action.
This list will be the basis for the access obligations.
Specific cases (background):
Limitations to use of background due to security or strategic interests (restricted
calls) (HE, DEP, EDF) — Where the work programme/call conditions provide for restricted
participation (e.g. due to security or strategic interests reasons), background that is subject
to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the
eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that would impact the
exploitation of the results should normally not be used (if possible).
The precise scope of this provision depends on the programme. Please cross-check with
the Grant Agreement you signed!
‘Background that impacts the exploitation of results’ should be understood as making the
exploitation of those results subject to control or restrictions, for example if exploitation
would require the agreement of the entity owning the background. If such background needs
to be used, this must first be agreed with the granting authority.
5. Ownership of results (HE)
Results belong to the beneficiary that generated/produced them (see Article 16.2).
Best practice: To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, keep documents such as laboratory
notebooks to show who produced the results, how and when.
If others (‘third parties’) could claim rights on results, the beneficiaries must ensure that they
can respect their obligations under the grant by making arrangements (transfers, licences,
other) with the third parties (e.g. affiliated entities, associated partners, associated partners
linked to a beneficiary in MSCA, employees, subcontractors, other members of Joint research
units (JRUs), etc). Such arrangements could be separate between the beneficiaries and the
third party, or in the consortium agreement if they concern affiliated entities or associated
partners. If making such arrangements is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using
the third party to generate the results.
Examples (third parties that may claim rights): academic institutions in countries that have a
kind of ‘professor’s privilege’ system (according to which researchers may have some rights to the
367EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
results of university research); employees or students who carry out work for the action (if they
have rights under national law or their contract); beneficiaries for which affiliated entities carry out
a part of the work.
Examples (arrangements): transferring (partial) ownership to the beneficiary; granting access
rights to the beneficiary with a right to sub-license.
The list of owners of the results generated by the action must be provided to the granting
authority at the end of the action in the final reporting (results ownership list (ROL)).
In case of joint ownership, all joint owners must be listed even if (some of) the joint owners
are not members of the consortium. The results ownership list provides a snapshot in time,
meaning that ownership changes may happen after the submission of the final periodic
report.
If the ownership of the results is not clear, the beneficiaries should indicate all potential
owners.
Example: A beneficiary is involved in a legal dispute on the ownership.
Specific cases (ownership of results):
Results generated by associated partners — For results generated by associated
partners, the situation is similar to that of beneficiaries not having received funds within the
meaning of the HE Regulation 2021/695. Provisions in the Annex 5 that apply only to
‘beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant’ do NOT apply (e.g. the obligation
to protect the results or the best efforts obligation to exploit the results). Respect of all other
obligations (e.g. obligation to provide access if needed to implement the project or exploit the
results or obligations related to dissemination/open science) must be ensured.
Automatic joint ownership — If beneficiaries have jointly generated results and it is not
possible to establish their respective contribution or to separate them for protection, the
beneficiaries automatically become joint owners.
In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must conclude a joint ownership agreement (in
writing).
This agreement should cover in particular:
Joint ownership agreement content:
▪ how the ownership is divided (e.g. equally or not).
▪ if/how the joint results will be protected, including issues related to the cost of
protection (e.g. patent filing and examination fees, renewal fees, prior state-of-
the-art searches, infringement actions, etc), or to the sharing of revenues or
profits.
▪ how the joint results will be exploited and disseminated.
▪ how disputes will be settled (e.g. via a mediator, applicable law, etc).
Best practice: Include at least general principles on joint ownership already in the consortium
agreement to make it easier to negotiate a full joint ownership agreement later on.
Unless otherwise provided in the consortium agreement or the joint ownership agreement,
the joint owners automatically have the right to grant non-exclusive licences to third parties
against fair and reasonable compensation (without prior authorisation from the other joint
owners). The joint owner that intends to grant the licence must give the other joint owners at
least 45 days advance notice (together with sufficient information, to check if the proposed
compensation is fair and reasonable). Such licences may not include sub-licensing.
368EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The joint owners may agree in writing not to continue with joint ownership and apply another
regime.
Example: The joint owners may transfer ownership to a single owner and agree on more
favourable access rights (or on any other fair counterpart). In such case, the rules regarding
transfer of ownership apply.
The joint owners may agree to apply another regime even before the results are generated,
e.g. in the consortium agreement, if they consider it appropriate.
Joint ownership by agreement — Outside the cases described above, the beneficiaries
may also become joint owners if they specifically agree on it.
Example: A beneficiary may decide that a part of its results will be owned jointly with its parent
company or another third party. Also in this case, the rules regarding transfer or ownership apply.
6. Protection of results (HE)
‘Beneficiaries having received funding under the grant’ must:
– examine the possibility of protecting their results and
– if possible and justified taking into account all relevant considerations, protect them.
Examples (no protection necessary): If protection is impossible under EU or national law or not
justified (in view of the absence of potential for commercial or industrial exploitation, if the action’s
objective does not require protection, if additionally protecting a part of certain technology would
not bring significantly broader protection, etc)
Beneficiaries are in principle free to choose any available form of protection, but protection
should be adequate depending on the characteristics of the results to ensure effective
protection. While some forms of IP protection, such as copyright, do not require registration,
others, such as patent, trade marks or industrial design require the filing of an application
before the relevant registration body. Although important for commercial and industrial
exploitation, IP protection is not mandatory, if not justified.
Standard forms of protection:
▪ Patent
▪ Trademark
▪ Industrial design
▪ Copyright
Examples: Protection for a design: e.g. industrial design, copyright.
In some cases, it may be advisable to protect an invention by keeping it confidential as a
trade secret, or to postpone the filing of a patent (or other IPR) application.
Example (better not to protect for the moment): Keeping an invention (temporarily)
confidential could allow further development of the invention while avoiding the negative
consequences associated with premature filing (earlier priority and filing dates, early publication,
possible rejection due to lack of support or industrial applicability, etc) but this requires careful
consideration given the possible risks of such an approach.
Best practice: Consider seeking expert advice to help you to decide whether and how to
protect results.
Costs related to protection are eligible, if they fulfil the cost eligibility conditions set out in
Article 6.
369EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
When deciding on protection, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’
legitimate interests. Any other beneficiary invoking legitimate interests must demonstrate
how the decision would harm them. The mere fact that the protection would establish an
exclusive right which could affect beneficiaries which are competitors is not a legitimate
interest.
Example (harm): The protection could lead to the disclosure of valuable background that is held
by the other beneficiary (as a trade secret or flagged as confidential) and may require coordination.
Best practice: Although beneficiaries are not required to consult other beneficiaries before
deciding whether to protect their results or not, it may be advisable to provide for
arrangements (either in the consortium agreement or in separate agreements), to ensure
that where needed decisions on protection take due account of the interests of all
beneficiaries concerned.
Protection should last for an appropriate period and have appropriate territorial coverage (in
view of potential) commercial or industrial exploitation and other elements (e.g. potential
markets and countries in which potential competitors are located).
Patent applications should identify the rightful inventors.
Example (not rightful inventor): An entity systematically designates a head of department as
one of the inventors, although it is not true.
Be aware that errors (or fraud) in identifying inventors may lead to the invalidation of
the patent.
7. Exploitation of results (HE)
The beneficiaries must take measures aiming to ensure the exploitation of their results —
either by themselves (e.g. a beneficiary owning results uses them directly) or indirectly by
others (other beneficiaries or third parties, e.g. through licensing or by transferring the
ownership of results).
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific
measures to try to ensure that their results are exploited (to the extent possible and
justified).
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken (see Article 20).
Security obligations — Exploitation must be compliant with other grant obligations,
such as security rules (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
Where possible, these measures should be consistent with the impact expected from the
action and the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results. The exploitation of
results should take into consideration the objectives of the Horizon Europe Programme (see
specific objectives in Article 3(2) of the HE Regulation 2021/695), including promoting
innovation in the EU and strengthening the European Research Area.
The ’plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities’
is a document that details the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that
will be carried out during the project (or afterwards) , to achieve the expected impact.
All proposals must (unless explicitly excluded by the work programme/call conditions),
include a first version of the plan (summary of the planned activities under the description of
the impact pathways). If successful, the projects will then have to provide the complete plan
for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities (normally
within the first six months of the action and then regularly update it). Moreover, beneficiaries
370EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
will have to report on the activities undertaken. See Annex 5 > Communication,
dissemination and visibility.
‘Exploitation’ (as defined at the beginning of Annex 5) means the use of results in further
research and innovation activities other than those covered by the action concerned,
including among other things, commercial exploitation such as developing, creating,
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in
standardisation activities.
Exploitation can also be non commercial, for example use in non-commercial research
or non-commercial teaching activities. When results of the action are used to influence R&I
policy or decision making, this is another form of exploitation.
Best practice: Consider applying for dissemination and exploitation support services,
including go to market support and IP management provided by the European Commission,
during and after the end of your action i.e. the Horizon Results Booster. This service is
available to all running and finished projects.
The best effort obligation applies only to ‘beneficiaries having received funding under the
grant’ and applies during the action and up to four years after the end of the action.
Specific case (exploitation of results):
Additional exploitation obligations (HE) — Where the work programme/call conditions
provide for additional exploitation obligations, those obligations must also be complied
with/fulfilled (by ALL beneficiaries, unless explicitly stated otherwise).
Additional information obligation relating to standards (HE) — Where the work
programme/call conditions provide for this additional obligation, the beneficiaries must
moreover inform the granting authority on any results that could contribute to European or
international standards.
Example: The results are produced in an area in which standards play an important role (such as
in mobile communication, diagnostics or immunological diseases).
Public emergency — Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional
exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency, when requested by the granting
authority, the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences under fair and reasonable
conditions to legal entities that need the results to address the public emergency and commit
to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services at fair and reasonable
conditions.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. for HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Be also aware that for calls specifically addressing a public emergency, the additional
exploitation obligations may already have been activated directly in the work
programme/call conditions. In this case, there will normally not be an additional request by
the granting authority.
‘Public emergencies’ are emergencies characterised by an unexpected genuine and
sufficiently serious threat undermining EU security, public order or public health.
Examples: Public emergencies could cover events such as pandemic diseases (like Covid-19),
terrorist attacks, hacking, earthquakes, tsunamis, CBRN events, e.g. novel and highly fatal
infectious agents or biological or chemical toxins, as well as those from resulting cascading risks.
371EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The public emergency obligation is a last resort option that will only be activated if the
granting authority considers that the EU security, public order or public health cannot be
protected by any less restrictive measure.
Thus, the granting authority will for instance not request activation of the public emergency
obligation if it considers that the beneficiary is able to address the public emergency themself
and commits to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services directly or
indirectly at fair and reasonable conditions. In most cases the obligation will therefore
probably remain dormant.
In case of activation of the public emergency provision by a request of the granting authority,
the duration of the obligations and the fairness and reasonability of the licences will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the specific circumstances of the public
emergency, the context of each project and the nature of its results.
As this is an additional exploitation obligation, the beneficiary cannot OPT out and must
comply with the additional obligations if requested by the granting authority.
Best practice: If you intend to grant any exclusive licences to results that might be
concerned, you must make sure that the licensing agreement allows for an eventual
activation of the obligation (e.g. that it allows you to suspend the exclusive character and
grant licences).
Horizon Results Platform (HE) — The Horizon Results Platform (HRP) is a platform
developed by the European Commission to help promote the exploitation of the results from
the R&I framework programmes. It allows beneficiaries of grants from FP7, Horizon 2020,
Horizon Europe and Euratom to publish and promote the uptake of their results towards their
target audiences. It can be accessed by beneficiaries through the Portal.
Detailed instructions on how to publish results can be found in the IT How To > Managing
Project Results in the Horizon Results Platform.
Beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to consider the use of this free Platform to their own
benefit, at any stage of the project, during as well as after the end of the project, provided
they have key exploitable results (KER; high potential to be exploited, i.e.to be used in a
product, process or service, or act as an important input to further research, R&I related
policy or education, etc). Results such as outcomes or announcements of consortia meetings,
conferences or other events are not considered as key exploitable results and all project
deliverables are not necessarily key exploitable results either.
Publishing results in the Horizon Results Platform ensures high visibility to a variety of
potential users and stakeholders including industry, academia, investors, public
administrations, etc and may lead to finding help to exploit the results directly (e.g.
financing) or finding third parties which may be interested to exploit the results.
Example: Certain beneficiaries in a project have developed a prototype and have jointly filed for
intellectual property protection, however they do not have the capacity to bring the results to the
market. The beneficiaries concerned published their results on the Horizon Results Platform and a
company signalled its interest to use the technology in its production line. After negotiations, the
beneficiaries agreed to transfer ownership of the prototype and any attached rights to this
company in return for royalties.
The use of the Horizon Results Platform becomes mandatory, if one year after the end of
the action, key exploitable results are not exploited.
Example: Beneficiaries in a project have developed R&I policy recommendations and guidelines to
be used by public authorities in case of water pollution resulting from industrial activities. The
beneficiaries would like to see them being used but despite their best efforts they have not
managed to have local authorities use them. At the latest one year after the end of the grant, the
beneficiaries must publish the policy recommendations on the Horizon Results Platform (with the
372EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
appropriate result type = ‘policy related result’). Publishing them on HRP will provide them visibility
to policymakers from local, regional, national and EU authorities and also regulatory bodies.
However, if justified on the basis of a request of the beneficiary, the obligation to use the
Horizon Results Platform may be waived.
Examples:
1. A beneficiary is intending to exploit certain key exploitable results commercially, either
directly or indirectly, but awaits a marketing authorisation before being able to do so.
2. Two beneficiaries owning results are close to finalising an agreement with a third party to
exploit certain key exploitable results.
3. The Platform cannot be used because of the security recommendations that the project is
subject to.
Using the Platform does NOT mean that the beneficiary concerned should no longer use its best
efforts to exploit its results directly or indirectly via other means.
8. Transfers and licencing of results (HE)
Transfers of ownership:
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect
compliance with their obligations under the Agreement.
Security obligations — Transfer may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are
subject to limited disclosure/dissemination (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security).
In case of transfer, the beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations (regarding the
results) apply to the new owner and that this new owner will pass them on in any subsequent
transfer (e.g. by including this in their arrangements with the new owner).
Obligations that must be extended to new owners:
▪ Possible joint ownership obligations
▪ Protection of results
▪ Exploitation of results
▪ Transfer and licensing of results
▪ Access rights to result
▪ Dissemination of results, open science and visibility of EU funding.
When transferring ownership, they must also consider the other beneficiaries’ legitimate
interests, in particular:
− the beneficiary that intends to make the transfer must give the other beneficiaries
(that still have or still may request access rights) at least 45 days advance notice (or
less if agreed in writing; together with sufficient information to allow them to properly
assess the extent to which their access rights may be affected)
− any other beneficiary (with access rights) may object to the transfer within 30 days of
receiving notification (or less if agreed in writing), if it can show that it would
373EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
adversely affect its access rights; in this case, the transfer may not take place, until
the beneficiaries concerned reach an agreement
The mere fact that the results concerned are transferred to a competitor is NOT in itself a
valid reason for an objection. The beneficiary concerned must demonstrate the adverse
effects on the exercise of its access rights.
Example (adverse effect): Beneficiary A intends to transfer ownership of a new process it
created during the course of an action to a competitor of beneficiary B. If beneficiary B shows that
its access rights would be adversely affected by such a transfer (for instance, because the
competitor has a proven track record of systematically legally challenging beneficiary B’s claims),
the transfer may not take place until the two beneficiaries reach an agreement.
Granting licences:
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results, including on an exclusive basis, provided
this does not affect compliance with their obligations under this Agreement (e.g. they must in
particular ensure that any access rights can be exercised and that any additional exploitation
obligations are/can be complied with).
Security obligations — Licences may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are
subject to limited disclosure/dissemination (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and
security).
Exclusive licences (e.g. for commercial exploitation) may be granted only if all other
beneficiaries have waived their access rights and other access rights/obligations are
preserved, (e.g. the access rights of the EU, Member States or activation of the public
emergency obligation if applicable).
Specific cases (transfers and licencing of results):
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) — If a transfer of ownership is not explicit (through an
‘intended’ transfer) but part of a take-over or merger of two companies, confidentiality
constraints normally prevail (under M&A rules). Therefore, it may be necessary to inform the
other beneficiaries only after the merger/acquisition took place, instead of before.
Specifically-identified third parties — The beneficiaries may (by prior written agreement)
waive their right to object to transfers of ownership to a specifically-identified third party
(e.g. an affiliate entity of one of them). In this case, there is no need to inform them of such
transfers in advance (and they do not have the right to object).
Before agreeing to such a global authorisation, beneficiaries should carefully consider the
situation (and in particular the identity of the third party concerned), to determine if their
access rights would be affected.
Example: For large industrial groups, it is sometimes clear from the beginning that all results
produced will be transferred to another entity of the group, without being detrimental to the other
beneficiaries (who agreed to the global authorisation).
If the granting authority has the right to object to transfers, the beneficiary must formally
notify the request to waive its right to object in advance (through Portal Formal Notifications:
My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal
Notification) and the granting authority may object.
Joint research units (JRUs) — Where the internal arrangements of a JRU state that any
results produced by one member are owned jointly by all members, the JRU member that is
the beneficiary must ensure that it complies with the obligations on transfers under the Grant
Agreement (placing results under joint ownership of the JRU is a form of transfer).
374EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Common legal structures (CLS) — CLS (i.e. entities representing several other legal
entities, e.g. European Economic Interest Groupings (EEIG) or associations) that are
beneficiaries of an action may want to transfer ownership to one (or more) of their members.
This is not prohibited. However, the normal rules on transfers apply (e.g. access rights have
to remain available).
Best practice: Beneficiaries that are members of a common legal structure are strongly
advised to agree on specific arrangements with the other members of the common legal
structure, in particular relating to ownership and access rights.
Right to object to transfers or exclusive licensing — Where the work programme/call
conditions provide for the right to object, the granting authority may object to transfers or
exclusive licences (or, for Euratom grants, also non-exclusive licences) to legal entities
established in a non-associated third country if the granting authority considers that the
transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. for HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Possible grounds for objection:
▪ Planned transfer/licence not in line with EU competitiveness interests
Example: if the transfer or licence would create a major competitive disadvantage for
European companies or could make the results commercially unavailable on fair and
reasonable conditions in the EU
▪ Planned transfer/licence not consistent with ethical principles
Example: If the transfer or licence could cause the results to be used in a way that is not in
accordance with the fundamental ethical rules and principles recognised at EU and
international level
▪ Planned transfer/licence not consistent with security considerations (including, for
Euratom grants, the Member States’ defence interests under Article 24 of the
Euratom Treaty)
Example: If the transfer or licence could make results considered significant from a
security standpoint not readily available in the EU, or if security-sensitive results could fall
into the hands of third parties that are considered a security risk
▪ Planned transfer/licence weakens the EU scientific and technological bases.
Example: If the transfer or licence could weaken the EU capacity & independence in
strategic technological areas (e.g. quantum computing, artificial intelligence)
This right does NOT apply to results generated by ‘beneficiaries not having received funding
under the grant’.
The beneficiary must formally notify the granting authority in advance of any planned
transfer or exclusive licence (and, for Euratom grants, also of any non-exclusive licence)
through Portal Formal Notifications (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification).
A notification before the results are generated is allowed, if the specific results concerned
(and the details of the transfer/licence) can already be identified so an assessment can be
made.
Right to object waiver for specifically-identified third parties — A beneficiary may
formally notify (through Portal Formal Notifications: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project
375EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
> Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) a request to waive the right to
object regarding intended transfers or grants to a specifically identified third party, if
measures safeguarding EU interests are in place. If the granting authority agrees, it will
formally notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any
additional information requested).
Limitations to transfers and licensing due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy
or security reasons (restricted calls) — Where the work programme/call conditions
provide for restricted participation, prior approval by the granting authority is required
regarding any transfers or (exclusive or non-exclusive) licences to third parties which are
established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries).
9. Access rights to background & results (HE)
What & When? The beneficiaries must provide access to background and results, if it is
needed:
− by another beneficiary, for implementing action tasks or exploiting results
− by an entity established in a EU Member State or HE associated country and under the
direct or indirect control of another beneficiary, or under the same direct or indirect
control as another beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling such a beneficiary,
to exploit the results generated by that beneficiary— unless otherwise agreed or
provided for in other provisions of the Agreement.
Examples: Beneficiary A used background from beneficiary B to generate its results which is
also needed to exploit those results. Beneficiary A would like to use its entity C, a sister
company under the same control as beneficiary, established in a MS to exploit the results. For
this, entity C needs access rights to beneficiary B’s background. If entity C is established in a
Member State or an associated country, it has access rights unless otherwise provided for in the
consortium agreement. If not, the beneficiaries could agree on additional access rights (see
further below).
Other examples (restrictions) may be in relation to security related provisions or in case of
restrictions due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member
States.
There is NO definition of ‘needed’. The beneficiary owning the background or results has to
assess (on a case by case basis and taking into account the action’s specificities), if the
requesting beneficiary needs the access (and may refuse it, if it does not).
Example (results needed for implementation): If without these results, action tasks could
not be implemented, would be significantly delayed or would require significant additional
financial or human resources.
Example (background needed for exploitation): If without these results, exploiting a
result would be technically or legally impossible or if significant additional R&D work would
have to be carried out outside of the action to develop an alternative equivalent solution.
Best practice: To avoid conflicts and where appropriate, agree (e.g. in the consortium
agreement) on a common interpretation of what is needed.
However, for background there is NO (or a more limited) obligation to give access, if there
are restrictions (legal or otherwise) and the beneficiary has informed the others — before
acceding to the grant (or immediately when additional background is agreed on).
Example: A pre-existing agreement (e.g. an exclusive licence) which precludes the granting of
access rights to certain background for exploitation purposes.
By contrast, if a beneficiary contracts on background later, it must ensure that it can comply
with its access obligations under the grant.
376EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The other beneficiaries may waive their access rights, provided that such a waiver is made
in writing.
Best practice: Waivers should be made only on a case-by-case basis, once the results have
been correctly identified and it is clear that access is not needed.
How? Access rights are not automatic; they must be requested (in writing).
Best practice: Use your internal rules (e.g. consortium agreement) to specify how to make
such written requests.
Access may be requested even from beneficiaries who left the action before the end, under
the same conditions as from active beneficiaries. Similarly, if a beneficiary is no longer
involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant access.
If applicable, for entities established in a EU Member State or a HE associated country and
under the direct or indirect control, or under the same direct or indirect the same control as
another beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling such a beneficiary, access must be
requested directly from the beneficiary owning the background or results. However, the
beneficiary owning the background results may agree to a different arrangement.
Access to results for exploitation may be requested up to one year after the end of the action
— unless the beneficiaries agreed on another time limit.
The agreement by the beneficiary owning the results (on the request for access) may be in
any form (tacit, explicit, in writing or oral).
Best practice: To keep a record of entities that have access, a written agreement may be
needed, in particular for important background or results.
In case of disagreement, the requesting beneficiary can better substantiate its request,
withdraw it or resort to the conflict resolution procedures foreseen by the consortium (e.g. in
the consortium agreement). If a conflict on access rights to results is likely to affect the
action implementation, the beneficiaries must immediately inform the granting authority.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary
no longer has access rights.
Conditions for access:
Royalty free — Fair and reasonable conditions
Access to results must be given:
– for the implementation of action tasks: royalty-free
– for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions.
Examples (monetary compensation): A lump sum, a royalty percentage, or a combination
of both.
Examples (non-financial terms): A requirement to grant access to technology it has, or to
agree on cooperation in a different field or in a future project.
Best practice: In case financial terms are involved, it may not be always possible to
determine, at the moment of agreeing to these terms, what fair and reasonable financial
conditions are, since the potential value of the foreground or background and the ways of
exploitation may not be clear. Beneficiaries could in such cases opt for an open system which
allows them to take into account unexpected developments, for example by adjusting royalty
percentages in case certain milestones are reached.
377EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The conditions for access to background are slightly different. Unless restrictions apply,
access must be given:
– for the implementation of action tasks: the default rule is royalty-free
However, if agreed by the beneficiaries before the grant is signed, for background
other conditions may apply.
Example: A beneficiary owns a novel technology needed by other beneficiaries for
implementing their tasks under the action and the other beneficiaries do not bring the same
level of background. In such case the beneficiaries may agree that access to the novel
technology to implement the action will not be on a royalty-free basis.
Best practice: If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is
recommended that this is explained in detail in their proposal. Royalty fees paid for
access to background for implementation purposes may exceptionally be eligible costs
if explicitly agreed by all beneficiaries before grant signature (see Article 6.2.C.3).
– for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions.
Scope of access:
Sublicensing/Licensing — Additional access rights — More favourable terms — Additional
conditions
The access rights set out in the Grant Agreement cover only the access needed.
Access rights are a right to use by the entity concerned and do NOT automatically give the
right to the requesting beneficiary to sub-licence. (If this were the case, access rights to
results would be extended — without consent — to virtually any entity in the world, including
a beneficiary’s competitors).
Sub-licensing is only allowed if the beneficiary owning the results agrees — although such
agreement should not be unduly refused, if the sublicensing is necessary. In this case the
sub-licensing does not have to be royalty-free (even if the access rights concerned would be)
and can itself be made subject to specific conditions.
Examples:
1. A university may need the right to sub-license access to results needed to exploit its own
results to third parties, to make it possible to derive value from its own results.
2. In large industrial groups it is quite common that research is conducted by one entity and
exploitation by one or several other entities. Access rights enjoyed by the ‘research entity’ but
not by the ‘exploitation entities)’ would raise problems for those entities not covered by the
access rights for entities under the same control.
Best practice: If needed, agree on the terms and conditions of the sub-licensing generally
and in writing (in the consortium agreement or separately).
Examples: In such an agreement, they could foresee that sub-licensing could apply to the
results (or part of them), but not to the background; sub-licensing could apply to (some of the)
entities forming part of the same group , but not to (some of the) other entities.
The beneficiaries remain free to grant licences (including quasi-exclusive licences) to their
own results, as long as they can guarantee that all their grant obligations are/will be
respected, including that all access rights can be exercised. They can even grant an exclusive
licence to exploit their results, if the other beneficiaries have waived any access rights which
would make granting the exclusive licence impossible (and no additional obligations apply
with the same effect, e.g. additional exploitation/access rights obligations).
Beneficiaries are free to grant additional access rights to results, beyond the rights foreseen
in the grant if compatible with their obligations under the grant.
378EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Examples: Additional access rights for third parties (e.g. affiliated entities if they need it for
implementation purposes, entities under same control but not established in an EU Member State
or HE associated country).
Best practice: Such additional provisions may be included in the consortium agreement or in
a separate agreement.
Access may also be granted on more favourable terms (e.g. include the right to sub-licence)
or be made subject to additional conditions (e.g. appropriate confidentiality obligations).
Access rights may be exercised as long as agreed by the concerned beneficiaries (e.g. which
for patents could be until the patent expires).
Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies
and national authorities to results for policy purposes — Horizon Europe actions:
The granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies (and/or EU Member States
national authorities for Horizon Europe actions under the cluster ‘Civil security for Society’)
have specific access rights for policy purposes. Such access does not extend to beneficiaries’
background.
Access rights for the granting authority, Euratom institutions, funding bodies and
the Joint Undertaking Fusion for Energy — Euratom actions:
In Euratom actions, the granting authority, Euratom institutions, Euratom funding bodies and
the Fusion for Energy Joint Undertaking have royalty-free access, for:
− developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and programmes
− complying with Euratom’s obligations under international research and cooperation
agreements in the field of nuclear energy.
These access rights include the right to sub-license (e.g. to third parties involved in such an
international agreement) or to use the results in public procurement, as long as they are only
used for non-commercial and non-competitive purposes.
Example: Euratom is part of the ITER Agreement and is committed to disseminating information
on technological solutions developed in the context of ITER projects, and to sharing them on a
non-discriminatory basis with other ITER members and ITER itself. It does this by giving ITER and
ITER members royalty-free licences, including the right to sub-license, for the intellectual
property produced, so that they can publicly sponsor fusion and research programmes.
Additional access rights:
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional access rights, they must
also be respected and access granted.
Example: Additional access rights for the beneficiaries of linked actions.

COMMUNICATION, DISSEMINATION, OPEN SCIENCE AND VISIBILITY (— ARTICLE 17)
(HE)
Dissemination
Dissemination of results
The beneficiaries must disseminate their results as soon as feasible,in a publicly available format,subject to
any restrictions due to the protection of intellectual property, security rules or legitimate interests.
A beneficiary that intends to disseminate its results must give at least 15 days advance notice to the other
beneficiaries (unless agreed otherwise), together with sufficient information on the results it will disseminate.
381EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Any other beneficiary may object within (unless agreed otherwise) 15 days of receiving notification, if it can
show that its legitimate interests in relation to the results or background would be significantly harmed. In
such cases, the results may not be disseminated unless appropriate steps are taken to safeguard those
interests.
Additional dissemination obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional dissemination obligations, the beneficiaries must alsocomply
with those.
Open Science
Open science: open access to scientific publications
The beneficiaries must ensure open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to their results. In
particular, they must ensure that:
- at the latest at the time of publication, a machine-readable electronic copy of the published version
or the final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication, is deposited in a trusted repository
for scientific publications
- immediate open access is provided to the deposited publication via the repository, under the latest
available version of the Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or a
licence with equivalent rights; for monographs and other long-text formats, the licence may exclude
commercial uses and derivative works (e.g. CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND) and
- information is given via the repository about any research output or any other tools and instruments
needed to validate the conclusions of the scientific publication.
Beneficiaries (or authors) must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with the open access
requirements.
Metadata of deposited publications must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain Dedication (CC
0) or equivalent, in line with the FAIR principles (in particular machine-actionable) and provide information
at least about the following: publication (author(s), title, date of publication, publication venue); Horizon
Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and number; licensing terms; persistent identifiers
for the publication, the authors involved in the action and, if possible, for their organisations and the grant.
Where applicable, the metadata must include persistent identifiers for any research output or any other tools
and instruments needed to validate the conclusions of the publication.
Only publication fees in full open access venues for scientific publications are eligible for reimbursement.
Open science: research data management
The beneficiaries must manage the digital research data generated in the action (‘data’) responsibly, in line
with the FAIR principles and by taking all of the following actions:
- establish adata management plan (‘DMP’) (and regularly update it)
- as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP, deposit the data in a trusted repository;
if required in the call conditions,this repository must be federated in the EOSC in compliance with EOSC
requirements
- as soon as possible and withinthe deadlines set out in the DMP, ensure open access — via the repository
— to the deposited data, under the latest available version of the Creative Commons Attribution
International Public License (CC BY) or Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0) or a
licence/dedication with equivalent rights, following the principle ‘as open as possible as closed as
necessary’, unless providing open access would in particular:
- be against the beneficiary’s legitimate interests, including regarding commercial exploitation,or
- be contrary to any other constraints, in particular the EU competitive interests or the
beneficiary’s obligations under this Agreement; if open access is not provided (to some or all
data), this must be justified in the DMP
382EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- provide information via therepository about any research output or any other tools and instruments
needed to re-use or validate the data.
Metadata of deposited data must be open under a Creative Common Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or
equivalent (to the extent legitimate interests or constraints are safeguarded), in line with the FAIR principles
(in particular machine-actionable) and provide information at least about the following: datasets (description,
date of deposit, author(s) and embargo); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym
and number; licensing terms; persistent identifiers for the dataset, the authors involved in the action, and, if
possible, for their organisations and the grant. Where applicable, the metadata must include persistent
identifiers for related publications and other research outputs.
Open science: additional practices
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding open science practices, the beneficiaries
must also comply with those.
Where the call conditions impose additional obligations regarding the validation of scientific publications,the
beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access to data or other results needed for validation of the
conclusions of scientific publications, to the extent that their legitimate interests or constraints are
safeguarded (and unless they already provided (open) access at publication).
Where the call conditions impose additional open science obligations in case of a public emergency, the
beneficiaries must (ifrequested by the granting authority) immediately deposit any research output in a
trusted repository and provide open access to it under a CC BY licence, a Public Domain Dedication (CC 0)
or equivalent. As an exception, if the access would be against the beneficiaries’ legitimate interests, the
beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licenses —under fair and reasonable conditions —to legal entities that
need the research output to address the public emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the
resulting products and services at fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after
the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities
Unless excluded by the call conditions, the beneficiaries must provide and regularly update a plan for the
exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities.
The precise wording of Annex 5 may vary between EU programmes. Make sure to cross-
check with the Grant Agreement you have signed!
1. Specific rules for communication, dissemination and visibility (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules regarding communication and dissemination activities.
Most programmes use the standard set of additional rules concerning the communication and
dissemination plan and the additional communication activities. Some programmes (HE,
RFCS, DEP) use more customised provisions.
2. Communication and dissemination plan (some programmes)
Programmes that need more detailed information about the communication strategy followed
by the action, have a provision obliging the beneficiaries to provide their full communication
plan (— in addition to the key elements that already need to be part of each proposal/DoA
Annex 1).
383EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For more guidance and communication best practices, see Communicating about your EU-
funded project and the HE Social Media Guide.
3. Special logos (some programmes)
In principle, for 2021-2027, all programmes follow the corporate EU visual identity, meaning
that there are in principle no longer any programme-specific logos. There are however
exceptions for some programmes (e.g. CREA Media, LIFE, HUMA, UCPM). Also, Grant
Agreements of EU funding bodies (such as for instance the EU joint undertakings) will keep
using their own logos (in addition to the EU logo) and will require their use by the projects.
4. Limited communication and visibility to protect persons involved (some
programmes)
Some programmes (especially those active in conflicts and crises, like HUMA and RELEX), will
limit communication and visibility options in order to protect the persons working on the
ground. In these cases, the consortium may propose to the granting authority alternative
arrangement.
5. Dissemination (HE)
Unless it goes against their legitimate interests, the beneficiaries must — as soon as feasible,
but not before a decision on their possible protection — disseminate their results, i.e. make
them public.
Security obligations — Dissemination may be restricted/NOT possible for results that
are subject to security rules (see Article 13 and Annex 5 > Confidentiality and security).
Results that are disclosed too early (before the decision on their protection) may run the risk
of making protection impossible.
Example: If a result is disclosed (in writing (including by e-mail) or orally (e.g. at a conference)
before filing for patent protection — even to a single person who is not bound by secrecy or
confidentiality obligations (typically someone from an organisation outside the consortium) this
may invalidate a subsequent patent application.
NO dissemination at all may take place, if:
− the results in question need to be protected as a trade secret (i.e. confidential know-
how) or
− dissemination conflicts with any other obligations under the grant (e.g. personal data
protection, security obligations, etc).
The beneficiaries may choose the appropriate publicly available format for disseminating their
results.
Standard forms of dissemination:
▪ website
▪ presentation at a scientific conference, at an education and training event or other
events with stakeholders and potential users of the results
▪ peer-reviewed publication
The dissemination measures should be consistent with the plan for the exploitation and
dissemination of the results (see below) and proportionate to the impact expected from the
action.
384EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
When deciding on dissemination, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’
legitimate interests.
The beneficiary that intends to disseminate must give the other beneficiaries at least 15 days
advance notice (together with sufficient information on the intended dissemination) — unless
otherwise agreed.
Any other beneficiary may object to dissemination — unless otherwise agreed — within 15
days of receiving notification, if it can show that it would suffer significant harm (in relation to
its background or results). In this case, the results may not be disseminated — unless
appropriate steps are taken to safeguard the interests at stake.
Examples (significant harm): Disseminating the results would lead to disclosure of valuable
background held by another beneficiary as a trade secret or would make protecting another
beneficiary’s results more difficult. Appropriate steps could include: omitting certain data or
postponing dissemination until the results are protected.
Best practice: Beneficiaries should provide for arrangements (either in the consortium
agreement or in separate agreements) to ensure that decisions on dissemination take due
account of the interests of all beneficiaries concerned and yet allow for publication of results
without unreasonable delay. This may include a specific mechanism to resolve any disputes
as soon as possible.
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional dissemination obligations,
those obligations must also be complied with/fulfilled.
Example: Requirement to disseminate the results in a specific website.
6. Open science (HE)
‘Open science’ is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of
knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the research process.
The open science provisions in Horizon Europe contain a set of requirements and encouraged
practices that cover some of the most important aspects of open science. They concern
research outputs such as scientific publications and research data and additional open
science practices .
‘Research outputs’ are results to which online access can be given in the form of scientific
publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes, such as software,
algorithms, protocols, models, workflows and electronic notebooks.
6. Open science: Open access to scientific publications (HE)
Beneficiaries must ensure open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to
their results. This includes articles and long-text formats, such as monographs and other
types of books. Immediate open access is required i.e. at the same time as the first
publication, through a trusted repository using specific open licences.
‘Peer review’ is the assessment of manuscripts or publications by researchers with relevant
expertise.
An article is considered to be peer-reviewed when it has been scrutinized and approved by
expert researchers. The number of the positive assessments required is set by each
publishing venue.
Long-text formats — such as books/monographs and edited volumes — are considered to be
peer-reviewed if the manuscript (or a substantial part thereof) has been reviewed at least by
one independent expert external to the publisher or to the series scientific editor(s). PhD
theses and habitations for professorial degrees are considered peer-reviewed, if they are
385EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
formally published through a publisher. Book chapters are NOT considered long-text formats
but are treated similarly to articles.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open access to ALL publications, even
if they are not peer-reviewed.
How to provide open access:
Beneficiaries/authors may publish in the venue of their choice, either in a closed venue (i.e.
access to all content is restricted), an open access publishing venue or in a hybrid publishing
venue, provided that all their open access-related obligations as detailed in this section are
complied with.
‘Open access publishing venues’ are publishing venues whose entire scholarly content is
published in open access (e.g. open access journals, books, publishing platforms, repositories
or preprint servers).
‘Hybrid publishing venues’ are publishing venues which provide part of their scholarly content
in open access, while another part is accessible through subscriptions/payments (e.g. hybrid
journals and books). These are often journals/books based on subscription/purchase which
provide open access to part of their content when an open access fee is paid by their
authors/institutions (paid ad hoc or on the basis of an institutional agreement with the
publishers).
‘Mirror and sister journals’ (i.e. more recently established open access versions of existing
subscription journals, which may share the same editorial board as the original journal and
usually have (at least initially) the same or very similar aims, scope and peer review
processes and policies; these journals often have a name similar to the subscription title but
a different ISSN) are considered open access publishing venues for Horizon Europe grants
(not hybrid journals).
In parallel, beneficiaries/authors must deposit their publication in a machine-readable format
(i.e. structured format that can automatically be read and processed by a computer) in a
trusted repository — before or at publication time — and immediately provide open access to
the publication through that repository.
Publishing in an open access venue without depositing in a repository, does NOT comply
with the open access requirements. All peer-reviewed publications must be deposited in
trusted repositories and open access provided to them through the repositories.
When choosing the publishing venue and the repository, beneficiaries/authors must keep in
mind that licensing requirements, metadata requirements and validation requirements must
also be complied with at this time.
The European Commission offers Horizon Europe beneficiaries Open Research Europe
(ORE), an open access publishing platform with no publishing fees. ORE is offered as
an additional publishing option to Horizon Europe beneficiaries. When ORE is the selected
publishing venue, all requirements for open access to scientific publications are automatically
fulfilled, as ORE deposits publications in the all-purpose repository Zenodo under the
conditions required by Horizon Europe.
Immediate open access through the repository must be provided either to the final peer-
reviewed manuscript accepted for publication or to the final published peer-reviewed version.
Please also note that publication fees are only eligible when publishing in full open access
publishing venues (venues in which the entire scholarly content is openly accessible to all)
and not in hybrid venues. Publication fees may, in particular, include peer review fees,
including where the peer review service has been provided by an organisation different from
386EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
the one providing the publishing venue. Peer review fees for publications are eligible for
reimbursement only for the first round of peer reviewers.
Publishing fees (including page charges or colour charges) for publications in other
venues, for example in subscription journals (including hybrid journals) or in books that
contain some scholarly content that is open and some that is closed are NOT eligible costs.
Publishing fees for open access books may be eligible to the extent that they cover the
first digital open access edition of the book (which could include different formats such as
html, pdf, epub, etc).
Printing fees for monographs and other books are NOT eligible.
Repository requirements:
Beneficiaries must ensure deposition of and open access to publications (and research data,
where the case) through trusted repositories.
‘Repositories’ are online archives, where researchers can deposit digital research outputs and
provide (open) access to them.
Repositories help manage and provide access to scientific outputs and contribute to the long-
term preservation of digital assets.
They can be institutional, operating with the purpose to collect, disseminate and preserve
digital research outputs of individual research organisations (institutional repositories, e.g.
the repository of University X) or domain-specific, operating to support specific research
communities and supported/endorsed by them (e.g. Europe PMC for life sciences including
biomedicine and health or arXiv for physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative
biology, quantitative finance and statistics; Phonogrammarchiv for audio-visual recordings
the CLARIN-DK-UCPH Repository for digital language data or the European Nucleotide Archive
or databases of astronomical observations operated by the European Southern Observatory,
among others). There are also general-purpose repositories, such as for example Zenodo,
developed by CERN.
Personal websites and databases, publisher websites, as well as cloud storage services
(Dropbox, Google drive, etc) are NOT considered repositories. Academia.edu, ResearchGate
and similar platforms do not allow open access under the terms required and therefore are
also NOT considered repositories.
Trusted repositories can be grouped into three categories which may overlap:
− certified repositories, such as those certified by international organisations or
government-authorised certification bodies (e.g. CoreTrustSeal, nestor Seal
DIN31644, ISO16363)
− disciplinary or domain repositories commonly used and endorsed by the research
communities, and which are recognised internationally
− general-purpose repositories, institutional repositories or any other repositories that
present the essential characteristics of trusted repositories, i.e.:
− display specific characteristics of organisational, technical and procedural quality,
such as services, mechanisms and/or provisions that are intended to secure the
integrity and authenticity of their contents, thus facilitating their use and re-use
in the short- and long-term. Trusted repositories have specific provisions in place
and offer explicit information online about their policies, which define their
services (e.g. acquisition, access, security of content, long-term sustainability of
service including funding, etc)
387EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− provide broad, equitable and ideally open access to content free at the point of
use, as appropriate, and respect applicable legal and ethical limitations. They
assign persistent unique identifiers to contents (e.g. DOIs, handles, etc), such
that the contents (publications, data and other research outputs) are
unequivocally referenced and thus citeable. They ensure that contents are
accompanied by metadata sufficiently detailed and of sufficiently high quality to
enable discovery, reuse and citation and contain information about provenance
and licensing. Their metadata is machine-actionable and standardized (e.g.
Dublin Core, Data Cite, etc) preferably using common non-proprietary formats
and following the standards of the respective community the repository serves,
where applicable
− facilitate mid- and long-term preservation of the deposited material. They have
mechanisms or provisions for expert curation and quality assurance for the
accuracy and integrity of datasets and metadata, as well as procedures to liaise
with depositors where issues are detected. They meet generally accepted
international and national criteria for security to prevent unauthorized access
and release of content and have different levels of security, depending on the
sensitivity of the data being deposited, to maintain privacy and confidentiality.
Licensing requirements and IPR:
Scientific publications must be licensed under the latest available version of a Creative
Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or an equivalent licence. For
monographs and other long-text formats the licence may exclude commercial uses and
derivative works (as in CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND or CC BY-NC-ND or equivalent licences).
For more guidance, including an explanatory checklist of the rights conferred by the above
licences that will help researchers to understand publisher-equivalent licences, see the HE
Programme Guide.
Beneficiaries (or authors, where the case) must retain sufficient intellectual property rights to
be able to comply with their open access requirements.
The obligation to ensure open access under the conditions set out in the Grant Agreement
precedes any subsequent publishing agreement and is therefore a prior obligation with
respect to such agreements.
Best practice: Beneficiaries/authors retain the copyright on their work and grant, insofar as
possible, non-exclusive licences to publishers. To facilitate this, beneficiaries should put in
place institutional policies to ensure copyright retention by authors and/or beneficiaries and
compliance with the open access requirements.
To help you find publishing venues that comply with Horizon Europe open access
requirements, you can use:
- the Journal Checker Tool — can help to determine whether a specific publishing venue
allows compliance with the open access obligations of Horizon Europe
- the Directory of Open Access Journals — can help to identify full open access journals
that allow open access publishing under CC BY or an equivalent licence
- Open Research Europe — open access publishing platform of the European
Commission, allows automatic compliance with the Horizon Europe requirements.
Validation requirements:
Information must be given via the repository (or via the copy of the publication deposited in
the repository) about any research output or any other tools and instruments needed to
388EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
validate the conclusions of the scientific publication. Research outputs, tools and instruments
may include data, software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks
and others. Information should include a detailed description of the research
output/tool/instrument, how to access it, any dependencies on commercial products,
potential version/type, potential parameters, etc.
Best practice: It is recommended that open access is provided to these research outputs,
tools and instruments — unless legitimate interests or constraints apply.
Metadata requirements:
Metadata should be in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
principles. In particular, it should be machine-actionable (i.e. machine-readable, and
automatic computer processing can extract information from the metadata attributes
ensuring a cross-linking between different research outputs) and follow a standardised
format, in line with community standards, and should provide rich information on the
publication/data (author(s), publication title, date of publication, publication venue); Horizon
Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and number; licensing terms.
Additionally, metadata must be open access under a Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication (CC0) or equivalent, ensuring its reusability.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or a handle) must
be provided for the peer-reviewed version of the publication in the first publishing venue
(e.g. journal, book, publishing platform); where the peer-reviewed version has been
published in a preprint server or a repository as first publishing venue, the PID of that
version has to be provided. PIDs also have to be provided for all author(s) involved in the
action (such as ORCIDs or ResearcherIDs) and, if possible, for their organisations (such as
ROR IDs) and the grant (such as grant DOIs).
Best practice: It is recommended that researchers apply these requirements for metadata to
digital research outputs, including data and other tools and instruments identified as
necessary to validate publications.
Visibility, acknowledgment of EU support and disclaimers:
Scientific publications must also acknowledge the EU support and display the European flag
(emblem) and funding statement in line with the provisions set out in Article 17 and, where
applicable, the special logos set out in Annex 5 (see specific rules below).
Best practice: In addition to the metadata requirements, in order to facilitate the
identification of your action and follow-up by the granting authority and your
readers/audience, it is recommended to include, within the text of your publication, specific
information on the grant (e.g. project name, acronym, grant agreement number, and/or your
project's digital object identifier (project DOI)).
7. Open science: Research data management (HE)
Beneficiaries must manage responsibly the digital research data generated in the action
(‘data’) in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. They
should also ensure open access to research data via a trusted repository under the principle
‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.
Generated data also includes re-used data that have been processed or modified in a
systematic or methodical way.
The requirements for research data management apply only to data that are generated in the
course of the action. Beneficiaries should also consider re-used data when developing their
389EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
data management plans (DMPs), if they form part of their research and to the extent
possible.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to manage research outputs other than
publications and research data also in line with the FAIR principles and to adequately describe
relevant efforts in the DMP. Other research outputs may include software, algorithms, code,
protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks among others.
How to meet the research data management and open access requirements:
Beneficiaries must do the following to meet the requirements:
− establish a data management plan (DMP), addressing important aspects of research
data management
AND
− deposit the data in a trusted repository and ensure open access through the
repository, as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP.
Data management plan
Beneficiaries must submit a DMP as a mandatory project deliverable (normally within 6
months after grant signature). An updated DMP deliverable must then be produced mid-
project (for projects longer than twelve months) and at the end of the project (where
relevant).
The ‘data management plan (DMP)’ is a document that outlines from the start of the project
the main aspects of the lifecycle of research outputs, notably including data. This includes
their provenance, organisation and curation, as well as adequate provisions for their access,
preservation, sharing, and eventual deletion, both during and after a project.
Writing a DMP is an activity directly linked to the methodology of the research, i.e. good data
management will make the work more efficient/save time, contribute to safeguarding
information and to increasing the impact and the value of the data among the beneficiaries
and others, during and after the research.
Beneficiaries should maintain the DMP as a living document and update it over the course of
the project whenever significant changes arise. This includes (but is not limited to) the
generation of new data, changes in data access provisions or curation policies, attainment of
tasks (e.g. datasets deposited in a repository, etc), changes in relevant practices (e.g. new
innovation potential, decision to file for a patent), changes in consortium composition.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to encode their DMP deliverables as non-
restricted, public deliverables, unless there are reasons (legitimate interests or other
constraints) not to do so. In the case they are made public, it is also recommended that open
access is provided under a CC BY licence to allow a broad re-use.
For more guidance on research data management and making research data FAIR, and for a
DMP template, see the HE Programme Guide.
De posit and ensure open access through trusted repository
The data must be deposited in a trusted repository, ensuring open access via the repository,
as soon as possible and within the deadlines set out in the DMP.
The deposition of the data must take place as soon as possible after data
production/generation or after adequate processing and quality control have taken place,
providing value and context to the data and at the latest by the end of the project.
390EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This does not entail that data must be made open, but rather that it is deposited so that
metadata information is available and hence information about the data is findable. In
exceptional cases in which specific constraints apply (e.g. security rules), deposition can be
delayed beyond the end of the project.
Best practice: It is recommended to maintain data available for a substantial period — at
least five years, and preferably 10 years or even longer — according to specific needs and/or
disciplinary deposition practices, in line with the recommendations of the European Code of
Conduct for Research Integrity.
The data includes raw data, to the extent technically feasible, but especially if it is crucial to
enable re-analysis, reproducibility and/or data re-use.
Data underpinning a scientific publication should be deposited at the latest at the time of
publication, and in line with standard community practices.
For calls with a condition relating to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), data must be
deposited in trusted repositories that are federated in the EOSC in compliance with the EOSC
requirements. A list of the services offered by EOSC, including for storage and processing of
research data, can be found on the EOSC Portal.
Open access is required as the default for research data under the principle ‘as open as
possible, as closed as necessary’. This means that, as an exception, beneficiaries may or
must keep certain data closed for justified reasons; they must explain in the DMP the
exception(s) under which they choose to (or must) restrict access to some (or all) of the
research data.
Acceptable exceptions are: if providing open access is against the beneficiary’s legitimate
interests, including regarding commercial exploitation; if it is contrary to any other
constraints, such as data protection rules, privacy, confidentiality, trade secrets, EU
competitive interests, security rules, intellectual property rights or would be against other
obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Examples (valid justification):
1. Data which is commercially valuable may be kept closed if making the data open would
undermine the exploitation of the data or other results (such as could endanger trade secrets) or
make IP protection of results more difficult.
2. Data protection/privacy rules may mean that certain (sensitive) personal data cannot be made
open.
3. Security rules may also require closed data. In projects relating to the strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the Union, data should to be kept closed if making the data open
would put in jeopardy those objectives.
Licensing requirements:
Research data in open access must be licensed under the latest available version of a
Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) requiring attribution of
authorship, or a licence providing equivalent rights, or under a Creative Commons Public
Domain Dedication (CC0) or equivalent (which waives any rights to the data). The latter may
be appropriate in particular for large datasets that can be more easily re-used without
restrictions, or in any other case if authors so desire. A Creative Commons Public Domain
Mark (PDM) or equivalent should be applied to raw research data, unless the data meet the
requirements to be protected by copyright/database right.
Requirements for the re-use and validation of data:
Information must be given via the repository about any research output or any other tools
and instruments needed for the re-use or validation of research data. Research outputs, tools
and instruments may include data, software, algorithms, code, protocols, models, workflows,
electronic notebooks and others. Information must include a detailed description of the
391EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
research output/tool/instrument, how to access it, any dependencies on commercial
products, potential version/type, potential parameters, etc.
Best practice: Beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open access to these research outputs,
tools and instruments — unless legitimate interests or constraints apply.
Metadata requirements:
Metadata should be in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
principles. In particular, it should be machine-actionable (i.e. machine-readable, and
automatic computer processing can extract information from the metadata attributes
ensuring a cross-linking between different research outputs) and follow a standardised
format, in line with community standards, and should provide rich information on the data
(author(s), dataset description, date of dataset deposit, dataset deposit venue and dataset
embargo (if any)); Horizon Europe or Euratom funding; grant project name, acronym and
number; licensing terms.
Additionally, metadata must be open access under a Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication (CC0) or equivalent, to the extent that legitimate interests are safeguarded and
constraints are taken into account.
In cases where data is closed but there are no compelling reasons that the related metadata
should not be findable and accessible, it is recommended that open access is provided to the
metadata of the data, with CC0 public domain dedication or equivalent, if possible, while the
dataset itself remains closed.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) must be provided for the dataset (such as a Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) or a handle), for all author(s) involved in the action (such as ORCIDs or
ResearcherIDs) and, if possible, for their organisations (such as ROR IDs) and the grant
(such as grant DOIs).
All the above provisions regarding research data management are also recommended for
research outputs other than scientific publications and research data.
Beneficiaries (or researchers, where the case) should retain sufficient intellectual property
rights to comply with the research data management requirements and to follow the research
output management recommendations.
8. Open science: Additional open science practices (HE)
Where the work programme/call conditions provide for additional obligations regarding open
science practices, those obligations must also be complied with.
Such open science practices can include, where relevant, early and open sharing of research
(for example, through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, or crowd-sourcing);
research output management (beyond publications and data); measures to ensure
reproducibility of research outputs; providing open access to research outputs beyond
publications and research data (for example software, models, algorithms, and workflows);
participation in open peer-review; and involving all relevant knowledge actors including
citizens, civil society and end users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as
citizen science).
Specific cases (open science):
Additional obligations regarding validation of scientific publications — If provided for
in the work programme/call conditions, beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access
to data or other results needed for the validation of the conclusions of scientific publications,
to the extent that their legitimate interests are safeguarded and constraints are taken into
account (for example through agreements with relevant confidentiality provisions) and unless
they already provided the (open) access at the time of publication.
392EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
Additional obligations regarding open science in public emergencies — If the public
emergency provisions apply and can be activated on request of the granting authority (see
above for more explanations on additional exploitation obligations in case of public
emergencies), the requirement regarding immediate open access is extended beyond
publications, i.e. to any research outputs as follows:
− Beneficiaries must immediately deposit any research output in a repository and
provide open access to it under the latest version of a CC BY licence or having
released it via a Public Domain Dedication (CC 0) or equivalent. Immediate means
that deposition of the research outputs must take place as soon as feasible, taking
into consideration the urgent nature of public emergencies and the care for the public
good.
− As an exception, if providing open access would be against their legitimate interests,
the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable
conditions — to legal entities that need the research output to address the public
emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and
services on fair and reasonable conditions. This obligation will apply for a period of
time specified in the request and up to four years after the end of the action. The
duration of this obligation and the fairness and reasonability of the licences will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the specific circumstances of the
public emergency, the context of each project and the nature of its results.
This provision is intended to be broadly used and may therefore already be activated
generally in the General Annexes of the HE Work Programme for all calls under a given work
programme (e.g. HE Work Programme 2023-2024).
In addition to the requirements regarding data management plans (DMPs) outlined above, in
the case of a public emergency for which the granting authority has activated the provision
by a request made at the stage of the work programme/call conditions, the beneficiaries
should provide a DMP preferably with the proposal or at the latest before grant signature.
The work programme/call conditions may provide for additional obligations in this regard.
For more guidance on open science practices and how to incorporate them in the action see the
HE Programme Guide.
9. Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication
activities
Unless the work programme/call conditions explicitly state otherwise, proposals must include
a first version of the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including
communication activities. A more detailed plan will then need to be provided as mandatory
project deliverable (normally within 6 months after grant signature).
The ‘plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities’
is a document that details the communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that
will be carried out in the project to achieve the expected impact.
All measures described in the plan should be proportionate to the scale of the project, and
should contain concrete actions to be implemented. Where relevant (and in particular for HE
Innovation Actions), the measures should describe a plausible path to commercialise the
393EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
innovations. If exploitation is expected primarily in non-associated third countries, justify by
explaining how that exploitation is still in the EU interest.
This plan must be updated as required under the Grant Agreement (at least once before the
end of the project), in alignment with the project’s progress. Changes on the dissemination,
exploitation and communication activities can be introduced through the Portal Continuous
Reporting tool. The last version of the plan before the end of the project must include the
dissemination and exploitation activities that the beneficiaries plan to implement in a period
up to 4 years after the end the project.
During that period, beneficiaries must continue reporting on the progress of their activities
and on the project results through the Portal Continuous Reporting tool, which will remain
accessible.

1. Specific rules for carrying out the action (all programmes)
All programmes have additional rules for carrying out the actions.
Some of these additional rules are standardised (i.e. based on a similar text, e.g. specific
rules for public procurement actions, specific rules for financial support to third parties
(FSTP), specific rules for blending operations, etc). Others are completely customised and
programme-specific (e.g. specific rules for humanitarian aid operations (HUMA), specific rules
for ESF actions (ESF), specific rules for information and promotion campaigns for agricultural
products (AGRIP)).

Implementation in case of restrictions due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU
and its Member States
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security, the beneficiaries must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated
partners, [third parties giving in-kind contributions,] subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third
parties are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) —unless
otherwise agreed with the granting authority.The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation
with entities established in countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call
conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect
the strategic assets, interests, autonomy or securityof the EU and its Member States.

1. Specific rules for the participation in case of restrictions due to strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States (restricted
calls) (HE)
Where the work programme/call conditions restrict participation due to strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security (so-called ‘restricted calls’), the beneficiaries must ensure
that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners,
subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (FSTP) are established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or,
if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) — unless
otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
If applicable (and unless the work programme/call conditions provide otherwise),
beneficiaries should provide the necessary justification why the involvement of such entities
is needed. Thus, if already known at the time of submission, the proposals must clearly
indicate that they will involve such entities, i.e. identify (if possible) the entities concerned
and justify why their involvement is needed.
The beneficiaries must moreover ensure that any cooperation with entities established in
countries which are not eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or,
if applicable, are controlled by such countries or entities from such countries) does not affect
the strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States. This
includes but is not limited to cooperations that could negatively impact the protection and
exploitation of the results.

Recruitment and working conditions for researchers
The beneficiaries must take all measures to implement the principles set out in Annex II to the Council
Recommendation on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial
talents in Europe60 (from now on ‘the European Charter for Researchers’), in particular regarding:
- working conditions
- transparent recruitment processes based on merit, and
- career development.
The beneficiaries must ensure that researchers and all participants involved in the action are aware of them.

Horizon Europe and RFCS actions.
2. Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for their Recruitment —
Recruitment, working conditions and career development — Rights for the
researchers (HE, RFCS)
According to these rules, the beneficiaries must take all measures to implement the principles
set out in the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for their
Recruitment55.
The Charter provides a framework for researchers’ activities and career management, and
includes obligations for researchers, employers and funders. The Code of Conduct provides
for transparency to the recruitment and selection process, ensuring the equal treatment of all
applicants. It includes obligations for employers and funders.
55 Commission Recommendation 2005/251/EC of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on
a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75/67 , 22.3.2005, p. 67).
397EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific
steps to address conflicts between their policies and practices and the principles set out in the
European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers.
Record-keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation about the
steps taken and measures put in place (see Article 20).
The granting authority will verify compliance with this obligation, when monitoring the action
implementation and in case of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 25).
The beneficiaries must in particular implement the general principles and requirements from
that relate to recruitment, working conditions and career development.
List of principles (relating to recruitment):
▪ Recruitment
▪ Transparency
▪ Judging merit
▪ Selection
▪ Variations in the chronological order of CVs
▪ Recognition of mobility experience
▪ Recognition of qualifications
▪ Seniority
▪ Postdoctoral appointments
List of principles (relating to working conditions):
▪ Research freedom
▪ Accountability
▪ Non-discrimination
▪ Working conditions
▪ Research environment
▪ Funding and salaries (in particular, adequate social security)
▪ Stability and permanence of employment
▪ Gender balance
▪ Intellectual property rights
▪ Complaints/appeals and
▪ Participation in decision-making bodies.
List of principles (relating to career development):
▪ Career development
▪ Access to research training and continuous development (independently of the
researcher’s status)
398EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
▪ Value of mobility
▪ Access to career advice
▪ Supervision
▪ Evaluation/appraisal systems.
The principles relating to recruitments imply that beneficiaries should have a clear policy for
recruiting and selecting researchers, which is publicly available and ensures that:
− all research vacancies and funding opportunities are publicly advertised (e.g. via the
EURAXESS Jobs Portal56)
− vacancies and funding opportunities are also published in English
− vacancy announcements include a clear job description
− vacancy announcements include the requirements for the position or the funding
opportunity, and the selection criteria
− there is an appropriate time period left between publication and the deadline for
applications
− there are clear rules for the composition of the selection panels (e.g. number and role
of members, inclusion of experts from other (foreign) institutions, gender balance)
− adequate feedback is given to applicants
− there is a complaint mechanism
− the selection criteria adequately value mobility, qualifications and experience,
including qualifications and experience obtained in non-standard or informal ways.
These principles also apply to selection procedures that do not lead to formal employment
relationship (e.g. award of a research fellowship).

Specific rules for access to research infrastructure (HE)
[OPTION for all HE and Euratom ToA (except HE IA, HE PCP/PPI, HE ERC Grants, HE EIC Grants and
HE EIT KIC Actions): Specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities
Definitions
Research Infrastructures —Facilities that provide resources andservices for the research communities to
conduct research and foster innovation in their fields. This definition includes the associated
human resources, and it covers major equipment or sets of instruments; knowledge-related
facilities such as collections, archives or scientific data infrastructures; computing systems,
communication networks, and any other infrastructure, of a unique nature and open to
external users, essential to achieve excellence in research and innovation. Where relevant,
they may be used beyond research, for example for education or public services, and they
may be ‘single-sited’, ‘virtual’ or ‘distributed’61:
When implementing access to research infrastructure activities, the beneficiaries must respect the following
conditions:
- for transnational access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, transnational access to research infrastructure or
installations for selected user-groups.
The access must include the logistical, technological and scientific support and the specific
training that is usually provided to external researchers using the infrastructure.
Transnational access can be either in person (hands-on), provided to selected users that visit
the installation to make use of it, or remote, through the provision to selected user-groups of
remote scientific services (e.g. provision of reference materials or samples, remote access to
a high-performance computing facility).
- categories of users that may have access:
Transnational access must be provided to selected user-groups, i.e. teams of one or more
researchers (users).
The majority of the users must work in a country other than the country(ies) where the
installation is located (unless access is provided by an international organisation, the Joint
Research Centre (JRC), an ERIC or similar legal entity).
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they have generated under the
action may benefit from the access (unless the users are working for SMEs).
Access for user groups with a majority ofusers not working in a EU Member State or
Horizon Europe associated countryis limited to 20% of the total amount of units of access
provided under the grant (unless a higher percentage is foreseen in Annex 1).
- procedure and criteria for selecting user groups:
The user groups must request access by submitting (in writing) a description of the work
that they wish to carry out and the names, nationalities and home institutions of the users.
The user groups must be selected by (one or more) selection panels set up by the
consortium.
The selection panels must be composed of international experts in the field, at least half of
them independent from the consortium (unless otherwise specified in Annex 1).
The selection panels must assess all proposals received and recommend a short-list of the
user groups that should benefit from access.
The selection panels must base their selection on scientific merit, taking into account that
priority should be given to user groups composed of users who:
61 See Article 2(1) of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme Regulation 2021/695.
400EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- have not previously used the installation and
- are working in countries where no equivalent research infrastructure exist.
It will apply the principles of transparency, fairness and impartiality.
Where the call conditions impose additional rules for the selection of user groups,the
beneficiaries must also comply with those.
- other conditions:
The beneficiaries must request written approval from the granting authority for the selection
of user groups requiring visits to the installations exceeding 3 months (unless such visits are
foreseen in Annex 1).
In addition, the beneficiaries must:
- advertise widely, including on a their websites, the access offered under the Agreement
- promote equal opportunities in advertising the access and take into account the gender
dimension when defining the support provided to users
- ensure that users comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement
- ensure that its obligations under Articles 12, 13, 17 and 33 also apply to the users
- keep records of the names, nationalities, and home institutions of users, as well as the
nature and quantity of access provided to them
- for virtual access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, virtual access to research infrastructure or installations.
‘Virtual access’ means open and free access through communication networks to digital
resources and services needed for research, without selecting the users to whom access is
provided.
The access must include the support that is usually provided to external users.
Where allowed by the call conditions, beneficiaries may in justified cases define objective
eligibility criteria (e.g. affiliation to a research or academic institution) for specific users.
- other conditions:
The beneficiaries must have the virtual access services assessed periodically by a board
composed of international experts in the field, at least half of whom must be independent from
the consortium (unless otherwise specified in Annex 1). For this purpose, information and
statistics on the users and the nature and quantity of the access provided, must be made
available to the board.
The beneficiaries must advertise widely, including on a dedicated website, the access offered
under the grant and the eligibility criteria, if any.
Where the call conditions impose additional traceability62 obligations, information on the
traceability of the users and the nature and quantity of access must be provided by the
beneficiaries.
These obligations apply regardless of the form of funding or budget categories used to declare the costs (unit
costs or actual costs or a combination of the two).]
62 According to the definition given in ISO 9000, i.e.: “Traceability is the ability to trace the history, application, use and
location of an item or its characteristics through recorded identification data.”The users can be traced, for example, by
authentication and/or by authorization or by other means that allows for analysis of the type of users and the nature and quantity
of access provided.
401EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities (HE)
The specific rules for access to research infrastructure activities apply to Horizon Europe
actions involving transnational and/or virtual access to research infrastructure for scientific
communities (in particular calls under Part III of the HE Work Programme, ‘Research
infrastructures’).
The specific rules in Annex 5 apply independently of the cost form chosen by the
beneficiary (unit cost or actual cost; see Article 6.2.D.3 and 6.2.D.4).
2. Transnational access to research infrastructure (HE)
Grants including this type of activity usually reimburse — for the provision of transnational
access — the following types of costs:
− ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the research infrastructure or installation and
costs related to logistical, technological and scientific support for users, including ad-
hoc user training and the preparatory and closing activities needed to use the
installation)
− ‘users’ travel and subsistence costs
− costs of advertising the transnational access offered under the action
− costs related to the selection procedure (e.g. the selection panel members’ travel and
subsistence costs, logistical costs of meetings, fees, etc.)
− costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the
periodic technical reports. For this purpose, beneficiaries should keep records of the
names, nationalities and home institutions of users, as well as the nature and quantity
of access provided to them.
‘Installation’ means a part or a service of a research infrastructure that could be used
independently from the rest. A research infrastructure consists of one or more installations.
The access costs (first indent) may be declared as unit costs, actual costs or — under certain
conditions — as a combination of the two (see HE RI authorising decision57), while the other
costs in this list (users’ travel and subsistence, advertisement, selection, reporting, etc) must
be declared as actual costs (see Article 6).
If the access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget
category 6.2.D.3 Transnational access to research infrastructure unit costs. They must fulfil
the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for that budget category (see
Article 6.2.D.3).
If they are declared as actual costs, they must be declared under the other budget categories
(see Article 6). They must fulfil the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for
57 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
402EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
the type of cost in question (e.g. costs for other goods and services must also fulfil the
specific eligibility conditions for the cost category C.3 Other goods, works and services).
Capital investments (i.e. equipment costs for renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable
equipment, infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed , unless provided for in the
work programme/call conditions (see also Article 6.2.D.3).
Transnational access must be measured (in ‘units of access’).
The units of access for the various installations must be specified in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. A unit of access will always be specified for each installation (regardless whether
the access costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs).
Examples (units of access): Per beam-hour for a synchrotron; per night for a telescope; per
number of frozen embryos for a mouse repository; per week of access for a historical archive; per
campaign-day for a research vessel.
Detailed information on the provision of access activity must be described in the periodic
technical reports.
Record-keeping — The beneficiaries must keep appropriate records and supporting
documentation to justify the number of units of transnational access for which they declare costs,
including:
− users’ names, nationalities and home institutions
− the nature and quantity of access and provided to them
− the number of units of access provided.
This information must be included in the periodic reports to the granting authority.
3. Transnational access which must be provided (HE)
Transnational access can be either:
− in person (hands-on), provided to selected users that visit the installation or
− remote, through the provision to selected users of remote scientific services.
Remote transnational access requires competitive selection of the users to be served under
the Grant Agreement, since it always applies to resources that are not unlimited (e.g.
computing hours on a supercomputer or remote analysis of a sample). It is thus different
from virtual access, for which selection of users is NOT required.
Examples (remote access): provision of reference materials or samples (e.g. shipping of a virus
strain); performing a remote sample analysis or sample deposition; remote access to a high-
performance computing facility.
Transnational access must be given to selected user groups (free of charge).
4. Categories of users that may have transnational access — Limited access for
special user groups (HE)
For transnational access, the majority of the users, in a user team applying for access, must
work in a country other than the country(ies) where the installation is located (— unless
access is provided by an international organisation, the European Commission Joint Research
Centre (JRC), a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) or similar legal entity
with international membership).
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they will generate under the
action may benefit from the access (— unless the users are working for SMEs).
403EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
User groups in which all or most users work in non-associated third countries may ONLY
have access for up to 20 % of the total number of units of access provided under the grant.
The consortium should itself define whether this 20% limit is uniformly applied to the
different installations or some installations may be used more than others. This should be
done in the consortium agreement.
Specific cases (transnational access to research infrastructure):
Distributed research infrastructure — In the case of distributed research infrastructures,
the exemption for the user origin/location applies to ALL installations providing services under
the umbrella of the research infrastructure (e.g. the ERIC), even if owned/operated by a
different legal entity (e.g. local/national node of an ERIC). In this case, all concerned
installations must be clearly listed in the proposal as being part of the same research
infrastructure benefitting from the exemption (e.g. the ERIC) and the distributed research
infrastructure (e.g. ERIC) must be a beneficiary. Beneficiaries must keep evidence that the
access to these installations or to their services are part of the offer of the distributed
infrastructure (e.g. service level agreements, other agreements).
With regard to related installations operated by another legal entity (e.g. local/national node
of an ERIC), this legal entity participate as:
- an affiliated entity to the research infrastructure
- another beneficiary if also carrying out other tasks in the project not under the
umbrella of the research infrastructure
- a third party to which the research infrastructure is purchasing access services
excluding any profit margin (see Article 6.2.C)
- a third party providing in-kind contributions free of charge
depending on the statutes of the research infrastructure, the agreements with its
nodes, the expected level of use of the concerned installations and any other relevant
implementation aspects.
5. Selection procedure with a selection panel (transnational access) (HE)
For transnational access, access providers must set up a common selection panel that
regularly evaluates the applications for access and recommends a shortlist of the user groups
that will benefit from access.
If justified, access providers may use several different selection sub-panels.
Example: Different thematic selection sub-panels could be set up for a set of analytical facilities
serving multidisciplinary communities.
6. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to users — Controls,
impact evaluation (transnational access) (HE)
The beneficiaries must ensure that users comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant
Agreement.
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are respected by the
users (e.g. through the agreement for the use of the research infrastructure, i.e. Terms and
conditions for use).
They cover in particular the obligations regarding controls and assessment. Thus, the
beneficiaries must ensure that the granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA)
and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits
404EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
and investigations on the users (see Article 25), and in particular to audit proper
implementation of action tasks. If access is denied by the user, the costs will be rejected.
They must also ensure that the granting authority has the right to make an evaluation of the
impact of the action under Article 26.
7. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to users — Conflicts of
interest, confidentiality, visibility, liability (transnational access) (HE)
For transnational access, the beneficiaries must also ensure that the users comply with
certain other obligations under the Grant Agreement.
Obligations that must be extended to users:
▪ Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 13)
▪ Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 17)
▪ Liability for damages (see Article 33).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the
users.
8. Virtual access to research infrastructure (HE)
Virtual access applies to digital resources and services needed for research that are available
through communication networks.
Grants including this type of activity usually reimburse — for the provision of virtual access—
the following types of costs:
− ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the installation during the course of the
action and costs related to technological and scientific support for users access (e.g. a
helpdesk)
− costs of advertising virtual access offered under the action
− costs related to the assessment carried out by the board of international experts (e.g.
costs of organising a board meeting)
− costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the
periodic technical reports and the assessment report (see below point 3).
The access costs (first indent) may be declared as unit costs, actual costs or — under certain
conditions — as a combination of the two (see HE RI authorising decision58), while the other
costs in this list (users’ travel and subsistence, advertisement, selection, reporting, etc) must
be declared as actual costs (see Article 6).
If the access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget
category 6.2.D.4 Virtual access to research infrastructure unit costs. They must fulfil the
general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for that budget category (see Article
6.2.D.4).
58 Decision of 19 April 2021 authorising the use of unit costs for the costs of providing transnational and virtual
access in Research Infrastructure actions.
405EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
If they are declared as actual costs, they must be declared under the other budget categories
(see Article 6). They must fulfil the general eligibility conditions and the specific conditions for
the type of cost in question (e.g. costs for other goods and services must also fulfil the
specific eligibility conditions for the cost category C.3 Other goods, works and services).
Capital investments (i.e. costs of renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable equipment,
infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed, unless provided for in the work
programme/call conditions (see also Article 6.2.D.4). In this case only the portion used to
provide virtual access under the project is eligible.
Virtual access must be measured (in ‘units of access’).
The units of access for the various installations be specified in Annex 1 of the Grant
Agreement. A unit of access will always be specified for each installation (regardless whether
the access costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs).
When allowed by the call conditions and in well justified cases, the grant proposal can also
define objective eligibility criteria (e.g. affiliation to a research or academic institution) for the
users to whom access will be provided under the grant.
Detailed information on the provision of access activity must be described in the periodic
technical reports, including statistics on all users in the reporting period compiled through
web analytical tools.
9. Virtual access which must be provided (HE)
Since virtual access applies to digital resources and services available through communication
networks (i.e. resources that are unlimited available), the users do NOT have to undergo a
formalised selection procedure (this, together with the transnationality of users, is the main
difference between virtual and transnational access).
Access provided must be free of charge for users.
Example: Access to a database available on the internet.
10. Periodic assessment by a board of international experts (virtual access) (HE)
For virtual access, the access services must be regularly assessed by a board of international
experts, at least half of whom must be independent from the consortium (unless otherwise
specified in Annex 1).
At least two assessments are usually carried out during the course of an action.
The assessment reports must already be foreseen in the proposal (as deliverables; see HE RI
application form) and be included in Annex 1 of the Grant Agreement.
406EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Annex 5 > HE PCP and PPI procurements
Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements (HE)
[OPTION for HE PCP-PPI: Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements
When implementing procurements in Pre-commercial Procurement (PCP) or Public Procurement of Innovative
Solution (PPI) actions,the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination,
equal treatment, sound financial management,proportionality and competition rules
- assign the ownership of the intellectual property rights under the contracts to the contractors (for PPI
procurements: unless there are exceptional overriding public interests which are duly justified in
Annex 1), with the right of the buyers to access results —on a royalty-free basis—for their own use
and to grant (or to require the contractors to grant) non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the
results for them —under fair and reasonable conditions —without any right to sub-license
- allow for all communications to be made in English (and any additional languages chosen by the
beneficiaries)
- ensure that prior information notices, contract notices and contract award notices contain information
on the EU funding and a disclaimer that the EU is not participating as contracting authority in the
procurement
- allow for the award of multiple procurement contracts within the same procedure (multiple sourcing)
- for procurements involving classified information: apply the security rules set outin Annex 5 mutatis
mutandis to the contractors and the background and results of the contracts
- where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons: apply the restrictions set out in Annex 5 mutatis mutandis to the contractors and the
results under the contracts
- where the call conditions impose a place of performance obligation: ensure that the part of the
activities that is subject to the place of performance obligation is performed in the eligible countries or
target countries set out in the call conditions
- to ensure reciprocal level of market access: where the WTO Government Procurement Agreement
(GPA) does not apply, ensure that the participation in tendering procedures is open onequal terms to
bidders from EU Member States and all countries with which the EU has an agreement in the field of
public procurement under the conditions laid down in that agreement, including all Horizon Europe
associated countries. Where the WTO GPA applies, ensure that tendering procedures are also open to
bidders from states that have ratified this agreement, under the conditions laid down therein. ]
1. Specific rules for PCP and PPI procurements (HE)
These specific provisions apply to HE PCP and PPI types of action (i.e. calls with PCP/PPI
ToA).
They summarise the key requirements from General Annex H of the HE Work Programme for
the beneficiaries that are part of the buyers group (procurers).
407EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Formally speaking, the Annex 5 provisions apply ONLY for calls that run as PCP/PPI type
of action (i.e. where also the specific cost category in Article 6.2.D.5 applies).
Other types of calls (RIA, IA, CSA, etc) are NOT subject to Annex 5 (nor to Article
6.2.D.5) —even if projects should include PCP or PPI activities. For them, the PCP/PPI
activities must be handled as subcontracting in accordance with Article 6.2.B and Article
9.3.
However, for BOTH groups, the detailed provisions in General Annex H of the HE Work
Programme apply. If you plan to implement PCP or PPI activities in a Horizon Europe action,
you should therefore always first look at the General Annex.
2. Conflict of interest (HE)
The beneficiaries must avoid potential conflicts of interest in the preparation and
implementation of PCP/PPI procurements.
‘Conflict of interests’ means any situation where the impartial and objective implementation
of the Agreement could be compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life, political
or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect interest (see Article 12).
Therefore, entities that could have a potential conflict of interest with the PCP/PPI
procurement should in principle NOT be involved in the EU grant.
Thus, for instance potential providers of solutions can NOT participate as beneficiaries,
affiliated entities or associated partners in the EU grant. They can also NOT be used as
external experts, consultants or subcontractors for tasks to help prepare and/or manage the
PCP/PPI procurement (e.g. tasks for preparing the open market consultation and/or tender
specifications, evaluation of tenders, management of the procurement procedure).
Entities that are not potential providers, but which represent such providers (e.g. industry /
research associations or funding agencies, standardisation fora / bodies) can participate but
must take specific measures to ensure avoidance of conflict of interest. They must, for
instance, ensure that:
− the activities are performed in an impartial, independent way by their own staff (not
by staff of the providers)
− any interactions with providers are done in a non-discriminatory way (ensuring equal
treatment of ‘all’ providers, without giving any preferential treatment to those
providers that are represented by the entity).
3. Transparency — Communications in English — Equal treatment and non-
discrimination of tenderers and providers (HE)
The beneficiaries must comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and
equal treatment.
The transparency requirements apply both before, during and after the end of the PCP/PPI
procurement. They aim to ensure that all potentially interested providers are informed well
in advance to be able to make an offer and to disseminate the results of the PCP/PPI
procurement in line with the Horizon Europe policy on dissemination.
The public procurers must, in particular:
− publish prior information notices for the open market consultation (PINs), contract
notices and contract award notices in the OJEU (TED)
408EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− at the end of the PCP/PPI tender evaluation (for PCP, also for each phase) provide to
the granting authority:
− information on the total number of bids received, winning tenderer(s) and
abstracts of their project(s) (template) — public deliverable; will be published by
the granting authority
− final ranking list of the selected projects, final scores and qualitative assessment
per criterion for each bid received, minutes of the evaluation meeting — non-
public deliverable
− at the end of the action:
− give a demonstration to the granting authority of the tested solutions (PCP),
respectively the deployed innovative solution(s) (PPI)
− assessment by the procurers of the results achieved by each tenderer (for PCPs,
also after each phase) (template) — public deliverable; will be published by the
granting authority
Additional requirements for the PINs, contract notice and contract award notices (including
timing and exceptions) are set out in the General Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
Regarding deadlines for publication of notices, we will consider as the ‘date of publication’ the
date when you submitted the notice to the OJEU Publication Office.
In order to foster wide participation of potential providers from across Europe, the
procurement procedure must be done at least in English. In addition to English, you can also
choose to allow other languages.
This obligation applies not only to the language(s) used by the public procurers for
publication of the PINs, contract notice and contract award notice, the tender specifications
and contracts, but also to the language(s) that tenderers are allowed to use for the
submission of questions and offers.
Additional transparency requirements (including timing and exceptions) are set out in General
Annex H of the HE Work Programme.
The beneficiaries must ensure non-discrimination and equal treatment of all tenderers,
throughout the preparation and implementation of the procurement.
They must pay particular attention to:
− keep market consultations open to all tenderers
− evaluate all offers according to the same objective criteria, regardless of the
geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of the tenderers
It is therefore NOT possible to restrict the access or give preferential access to:
− tenderers from your specific country, region or city
− startups or SME type solution providers
− tenderers with a specific governance structure (e.g. stock listed vs non-stocklisted
companies, foundations, NGOs, research organisations, etc).
− not to provide information in a discriminatory manner that may give some
tenderers/providers an advantage over others
409EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− not to reveal confidential information communicated by a tenderer/provider without
their explicit agreement.
This can be ensured by including appropriate provisions for communication and
confidentiality of information in the open market consultation and call for tender
documents.
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
4. Intellectual property rights (HE)
Results generated by the beneficiaries follow the standard rules on IPR in Article 16 and
Annex 5.
For results generated by PCP/PPI procurement providers, the ownership of the IPR must
be assigned to the providers (for PPI procurements: unless there are exceptional overriding
public interests which are duly justified in the DoA Annex 1).
For PCP procurements, the beneficiaries must reserve the rights to:
− enjoy royalty-free access rights to the R&D results for their own use
− grant themselves (or to require the providers to grant) non-exclusive licences to third
parties, to exploit the results for them under fair and reasonable market conditions,
without any right to sub-license
This right serves as a safeguard to ensure continuity of service and a competitive
supply chain (during or after the action). It does NOT mean that every PCP provider
will always and automatically be obliged to grant licences to third parties to exploit the
results.
Example (licences needed): Other providers working for the procurers need access to the
IPR to work for the procurers. A PCP provider abuses its monopoly situation in the
commercialisation of products resulting from the PCP and, in order to ensure a competitive
supply chain, the procurers need another provider on the market to be able to supply them the
products.
The right is only allocated to the procurers (not to third parties directly) and only
applies to cases when licensing to third parties is needed to exploit the results ‘for the
procurers’ (not for other potential customers). Therefore, the provision does NOT give
competitors of the PCP providers any rights to require the procurers and/or PCP
providers to grant them licences to exploit the results. The provision also does NOT
give the procurers any rights to grant (or require the PCP providers to grant) licences
to third parties to exploit the results for ‘other markets’ beyond the procurers. The
licensing must ensure also that the PCP provider is financially compensated under fair
and reasonable market conditions.
− require the provider to transfer ownership of the results to them, if the provider uses
the results to the detriment of the public interest (including security interests) or fails
to commercially exploit the results within a given period after the PCP as fixed in the
PCP contract (call back provision)
This right serves as a safeguard to prevent abuse of results and ensure commercial
exploitation of results in the public interest, in case the PCP providers fail to do so
themselves. It can be exercised after consultation with the PCP on the reasons for why
this happened. By obtaining the IPR ownership, the public procurers can ensure
410EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
commercial exploitation of the results in line with the public interest. It will be for
exceptional cases.
Example (call-back needed): A PCP provider is winding up its business or decides to stop the
production line that commercialises the PCP results. A PCP provider abuses security related
results, for example to hack public services.
− to publish public summaries of the results of the PCP procurement, including
information about key R&D results attained and lessons learnt (e.g. on the feasibility
of the solution approaches to meet the requirements and lessons learnt for potential
future deployment of solutions).
Details that would be contrary to the public interest, would harm legitimate business
interests (e.g. regarding IPR-protected specificities of their individual approaches to
solutions) or could distort fair competition may not be disclosed.
To see what is normally published, see the templates for PCP-PPI Contractor details
and abstracts and End of phase and end of project results and conclusions for PCP-
PPI.
This allows to optimise the conditions for the PCP providers to pursue wide exploitation of
results and for the procurers to use the results without supplier lock-in, while ensuring that
the PCP procurement complies with the conditions for its exemption from the EU Public
Procurement Directives and from the international procurement agreements between the EU
and third countries.
If additional exploitation obligations apply, the beneficiaries must moreover ensure that the
PCP/PPI procurement call for tender documents comply with these obligations.
Example:
1. Due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions may require
that PCP/PPI providers commercialise the majority of the results in EU Member States.
2. Due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions may restrict
the participation to the action to entities that are established in (and controlled from) EU Member
States. Annex 5, stipulates that in the case, the beneficiaries (in particular the procurers carrying out
the PCP/PPI) as well as the PCP/PPI providers may NOT transfer ownership of their results or grant
licences to third parties which are not established (and, if applicable, are not controlled from) EU
Member States — unless they have requested and received prior approval by the granting authority.
Finally, for all PCP/PPI procurements, the allocation of the IPR to the providers must be
factored into the tender price. This will allow to obtain the best value for money price
according to market conditions (and rule out State aid).
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
5. Multiple sourcing (HE)
For PCP procurements, the use of multiple sourcing is obligatory, because pre-commercial
is per definition a procurement approach that awards multiple procurement contracts for R&D
services to multiple tenderers within the same procedure, in order to compare and test
potential alternative solution approaches from different providers in parallel.
For PPI procurements, the use of multiple sourcing is optional, unless the call conditions
explicitly require it. Although multiple sourcing requires higher upfront investment from the
buyers in terms of procurement budget and effort needed to monitor the contracts, multiple
sourcing can be useful for the deployment of solutions in PPIs for a number of reasons:
411EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− security reasons: multiple sourcing can be needed to guarantee the required security
levels and assurances in the supply of goods or services
− security of supply: multiple sourcing removes the dependency on only one supplier to
deliver all solutions and can guarantee that there is at all times security of supply of
sufficient solutions. This may be vital where a steady, reliable supply of
products/services is needed but the supply chain is fragile and the risk is too big to
rely on one supplier only to deliver all required solutions (e.g. supply of COVID
vaccines)
− strategic autonomy: multiple sourcing can reduce the dependency on non-European
providers for example by awarding the same contracts to both European and non-
European providers. This can be vital in situations of geopolitical tensions or
uncertainty
− continuity of service: solution/technology redundancy guarantees that if one solution
of one provider crashes/fails, another can immediately take over
Example: Since so many public services run these days on digital networks, ICT networks
typically install nodes from different competing providers and load balancing ensures that if
there is a technical failure in nodes from one provider, nodes from other providers that are
implemented differently can immediately take over the task and there is no service disruption.
− complementarity of solutions: when none of the solutions of different providers works
on its own in all circumstances, and the simultaneous deployment of different
solutions from different providers is needed to cover all the possible situations that
may occur
Example: If a harbour wants to track goods across the full supply route, solutions based on
sensors, camera’s, optical scanners, satellite images can all detect movement of goods in
different situations, but none of them covers all situations (indoor versus outdoor, short versus
long range, high versus low accuracy). If there is no provider on the market with and end-to-
end solution that can address all situations and requirements, the best way forward may be to
buy and install simultaneously different solutions that use alternative technologies from
different providers.
− better value for money: by awarding the same contract to multiple providers, the level
of competition is maximised. If the performance of one of the providers drops
significantly, the public buyer will immediately notice and there is no hurdle for him to
switch immediately to one of the other providers. If the performance of one provider
significantly increases, the buyer can immediately ask the other providers why they
are not performing at the same level. This competition can incentivize providers to
continue to improve their level of performance and reduce their prices over time in
order to remain among the best of the pack.
6. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to providers — Security
related obligations (HE)
Actions that involve security issues must apply the security rules set out in Annex 5 mutatis
mutandis to the PCP/PPI procurement providers, the background and results of the
PCP/PPI contracts.
These security rules will impact the preparation and implementation of the PCP/PPI. The
procurers must ensure that the whole process (market consultation, preparation of the tender
documents, evaluation of tenders, award and performance of the contracts) respects the
security rules.
For PCP/PPIs involving classified information, the beneficiaries need to ensure that
throughout the whole process all involved staff on the side of the participating providers,
subcontractors and procurers and other involved beneficiaries have the required security
412EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
clearances, and that all communications and deliverables are submitted and handled
according to the applicable rules for handling classified information.
In addition, the security rules may impact the procurement procedures in terms of limiting
the information that be disclosed (both in terms of IPR, deliverables of the procurement,
dissemination activities), limiting the providers that can participate (both to the market
consultation and the call for tenders) and limiting the allowed subcontracting. All these
aspects require also prior written explicit approval of the EU granting authority.
PCPs/PPIs involving dual-use goods or dangerous materials and substances must comply with
applicable EU, national and international law on handling these items, and the procurers must
ensure that PCP/PPI providers deliver them the required export or transfer licences.
In case the Grant Agreement includes security recommendations that affect the PCP/PPI
procurement, the beneficiaries must ensure that the open market consultation and tender
documents comply with the recommendation.
For more guidance and templates for the tender documents to be used in HE, see How to set up
and manage HE PCP and PPI grants.
7. Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement to providers — Restrictions
on participation and/or control (HE)
If, due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons, the call conditions restrict
the participation to beneficiaries that are established in (and controlled from) eligible
countries, for example EU Member States only, , only procurers established in (and controlled
from) EU Member States are allowed to carry out the PCP/PPI procurement. Procurers
established in (and controlled from) third countries are NOT allowed to participate in the
action.
For such calls, the beneficiaries must apply the restrictions also to the contractors. For this,
the procurers must ensure that the PCP/PPI call for tender documents restrict participation to
bidders/providers established in the eligible countries. Other bidders/providers cannot
participate.
Example: Due to security reasons, the call conditions may require that the participation to the PPI
grants under the call is restricted to procurers from EU Member States (e.g. because the call
concerns solutions with potentially security sensitive products/solutions. The buyers group must
then incorporate provisions in its PPI call for tender documents that ensure that for the lots of the
PPI procurement that are concerned (i.e. involve the deployment of security sensitive
products/solution components), the participation is limited to bidders/providers that are
established in and controlled from EU Member States. For lots that are not concerned (i.e. do not
involve the deployment of security sensitive products/solution components), the participation
should remain open to providers from all countries with which the EU has an international
agreement on public procurement under the conditions provided by that agreement.
8. Place of performance obligation (HE)
Where the call conditions impose a place of performance obligation, the beneficiaries must
ensure that the part of the PCP/PPI procurement activities that is subject to the place of
performance obligation is performed (by the providers and their subcontractors) in the
eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions
413EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For PCP, a more general minimum condition regarding place of performance is also
set out in the General Annex H of the HE Work Programme, i.e. that the majority (i.e. at
least 50%) of the activities performed for the PCP contract as well as the principle R&D
staff must be located in EU Member States or HE associated countries.
The ‘activities performed for the PCP contract’ include R&D and operational activities (e.g.
research, development, testing, certifying solutions, etc).
The ‘principal R&D staff’ are the main researchers, developers and testers responsible for
leading the R&D activities covered by the contract.
For PPI, the minimum condition doesn’t apply since PPI procurements are typically
subject to the WTO GPA and other international procurement agreements.
Example (PCP): For projects in the field of security, the call conditions may specific for example
that 100% of the R&D work performed for the PCP contract on security components of the solution
as well as all the principle R&D staff working on security components must be located in the EU
Member States. The EU Member States are then the target countries for this additional place of
performance obligation. The procurers in the action must then ensure that their PCP call for tender
documents include not only the minimum place of performance obligation but also include the above
additional place of performance obligation. This will ensure that PCP providers and their
subcontractors implement minimum 50 % of all activities — including the non-security activities — of
the PCP in the EU Member States and HE associated countries and 100% of the R&D work for the
security components of the solution in the EU Member States.
Example (PPI): For projects in the field of security, the call conditions may specific for example
that 100% of the work for the PPI contract must be performed — and all the staff working on the PPI
contract must be located — in the EU Member States (or even in certain specific EU Member States).
The EU Member States listed in this obligation are then the target countries of this place of
performance obligation.
If a place of performance obligation applies, the beneficiaries must require PCP/PPI providers
to comply with it, including when they subcontract work.
The PCP/PPI call for tender documents and the procurement contract must clearly set out this
obligation and must require that it is passed on to subcontractors.
9. Market access for bidders from non EU countries — WTO GPA — International
agreements on public procurement (HE)
To ensure reciprocal level of market access, beneficiaries must ensure that where the WTO
Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) does not apply, the participation in tendering
procedures is open on equal terms to bidders from EU Member States and all countries with
which the EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement under the conditions laid
down in that agreement, including all HE associated countries. Where the WTO GPA applies,
ensure that tendering procedures are also open to bidders from states that have ratified this
agreement, under the conditions laid down therein.
PCP procurements are generally exempt from the WTO GPA and all other agreements on
public procurement between the EU and third countries because they are for R&D services
contracts (i.e. contracts with the objective to provide R&D services). Access to PCP
procurements can therefore be limited to PCP providers from the EU Member States and HE
associated countries (— and even restricted further in case of restricted calls due to strategic
assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons).
PPI procurements are generally not exempt from the WTO GPA and the other agreements
on public procurement between the EU and third countries. Access to PPI procurements must
therefore normally be open also to tenderers from third countries that are parties to the WTO
GPA or with whom the EU has an agreement on public procurement, under the conditions
specified in those agreements (— except for calls that are restricted due to strategic assets,
414EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
interests, autonomy or security reasons, provided that the restriction also falls under a
specific exemption in those agreements, e.g. exemptions for public security and public
health).
International agreements on public procurement usually also contain non-discrimination
obligations. Country of origin and other local content restrictions are thus only allowed in
PCP/PPI procurements if they fall under an exception/exemption of these agreements (e.g.
for PCPs: all PCPs are exempted, for PPIs: only limited exemptions exist, e.g. for security and
public health).
Example:
1. Due to the exceptional situation on public health created by the corona pandemic, COVID-19
vaccine procurement contracts may currently contain provisions requiring that vaccine production
takes place in the EU Member States and that essential components are sourced from the EU
Member States.
2. Due to exemptions for the utilities sector, public buyers in the utilities sector can reject tenders
for supply contracts when more than 50% of the products come from third countries with which the
EU does not have an international (WTO GPA or bilateral) agreement on public procurement.
3. Due to the exemption for PCP procurements, PCP procurements can require that essential
components for developing, testing and commercialising the solution are sourced from the EU
Member States and the countries associated to Horizon Europe as well as that the PCP providers
locate minimum 50% of the production of products and/or the provisioning of services that result
from the PCP in the EU Member States and the countries associated to Horizon Europe. If required,
e.g. due to security or public health reasons, this requirement could be restricted to EU Member
States.

[OPTION for HE and Euratom Programme Cofund actions: Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships
When implementing financial support to third parties in Co-funded Partnerships, the beneficiaries must respect
the following conditions:
- avoid any conflict of interest and comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and
sound financial management
- for the types of activity and categories of persons that will be supported:
- for multi-beneficiary projects (including multi-participant projects): the projects supported
must be transnational, involving at least two independent legal entities from two different EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries as recipients of the financial support
and may also include legal entities established in a non-associated third countries not
receiving financial support
- for mono-beneficiary projects (multi-participant projects): the projects supported must be
transnational, involving one legal entity established in an EU Member State or Horizon
Europe associated country as recipient of the financial support and one legal entity
established in a non-associated third country not receiving financial support
- for the selection procedure and criteria:
- publish open calls widely (including on the Funding & Tenders Portal and the beneficiaries’
websites)
- keep open calls open for at least two months
- inform recipients of call updates (if any) and the outcome of the call (list of selected projects,
amounts and names of selected recipients)
- measures to avoid potential conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants must be
ensured (notably through appropriate communication/exchange of information channels and
independent and fair complaints procedures)
- use the following selection criteria: the standard Horizon Europe award criteria
- use the following selection procedures:
- projects must be selected following a joint transnational call for proposals
- beneficiaries must make the selection through a two-step procedure:
- Step 1: review at national or transnational level (including national
eligibility checks)
- Step 2: single international peer review
and in Step 2:
- proposals must be evaluated with the assistance of at least three independent
experts
- proposals must be ranked according to the evaluation results and the
selection must be made on the basis of this ranking
- the selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer,
who must make a report.
416EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Where the financial support is implemented through implementing partners, the beneficiaries must:
- ensure that the partners comply with the same rules, standards and procedures for implementing the
financial support
- implement effective monitoring and oversight arrangements towards the partners, covering all aspects
relating to the action
- ensure effective and reliable reporting by the partners, covering the activities implemented,
information on indicators, as well as the legality and regularity of the expenditure claimed
- ensure that the partnersprovide that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF,
Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the final recipients
- where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or
security reasons: apply the restrictions set out in Annex 5 mutatis mutandis to the final recipients and
their results.]
1. Specific rules for Co-funded Partnerships (HE)
The specific rules (such as the participation of beneficiaries/affiliated entities as recipients of
FSTP) for Co-funded Partnerships apply to certain HE Programme Co-fund types of action
(i.e. calls with COFUND ToA). They replace the former Joint programming initiatives (JPIs),
European research area networks (ERA-NETs) and European Joint programmes (EJPs) Cofund
actions in Horizon 2020.
The Annex 5 provisions focus ONLY on the cascading scenario (i.e. where beneficiaries
provide financial support to third parties (FSTP); so-called ‘co-funded calls’). For
transnational projects implemented by the beneficiaries themselves (as part of the action),
the standard rules of the Grant Agreement apply.
Co-funded Partnerships are ALSO subject to the rules for recipients of financial support
(FSTP) in Article 9.4.
2. Providing financial support vs implementation of transnational projects by the
beneficiaries (HE)
A core part of Co-funded Partnerships is to provide financial support to third parties (i.e. pass
on the EU support they receive via the Co-funded Partnerships grant to recipients that are
not party to the Grant Agreement, also called ‘cascade funding’).
In this case, the beneficiaries’ activity consists in providing the financial support, while it is
the final recipients (‘third parties receiving financial support’) that actually implement the
projects.
Specific cases (co-funded partnerships):
FSTP between beneficiaries — Beneficiaries to the EU grant can in principle NOT also be
final recipient (since that is not the purpose of a cascading grant).
However, if explicitly permitted by the call conditions/Grant Agreement and included and
justified in the DoA Annex 1, there are cases where exceptions are permitted (i.e. where the
co-funded call can be opened also for entities that are also beneficiaries of the EU grant or
417EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
other departments of the beneficiary). In this case, the consortium will be asked during grant
preparation to:
- -propose a clear list of beneficiaries (or which department of a beneficiary, where
applicable) that will have the responsibility of drafting call texts, and managing the
award procedure
- -identify the beneficiaries (or other departments of the same beneficiary) which can
apply for funding under the co-funded call for proposals
- -explain the measures to mitigate (potential) conflict of interest or unequal treatment
of applicants (see information barriers below) and
- -reflect this fully in their DoA Annex 1, both in the context of the description of the co-
funded call and in relation to the monitoring of the transnational projects.
If needed, beneficiaries must set up information barriers (‘firewalls’) to prevent exchanges or
communication that could lead to conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants and
ensure independent and fair complaints procedures.
Costs can be declared ONLY by the beneficiary providing the financial support, NOT by the
final recipient receiving the financial support (even if it is at the same time beneficiary of the
grant and can therefore declare other costs).
3. Calls for transnational projects (HE)
The projects financed under the co-funded calls must be transnational, i.e. for Horizon co-
funded partnerships, they must involve:
− for multi-beneficiary projects (including multi-participant projects): at least two
independent legal entities from two different EU Member States or HE associated
countries which implement the project receiving financial support; in addition the
projects may also include legal entities from non-associated third countries not
receiving any financial support from the EU grant
OR
− for mono-beneficiary projects (multi-participant projects): one legal entity from an EU
Member State or HE associated country which implements the project with financial
support; in addition, to ensure their transnational nature, the projects must include at
least one legal entity established in a non-associated third country not receiving any
financial support from the EU grant.
Note that additional eligibility conditions may apply in specific cases concerning the minimum
number of independent entities (including entities from third countries).
For Euratom Co-funded Partnerships, references to ‘associated countries’ must be understood
as Euratom associated countries (not HE associated countries).
4. Award criteria (HE)
The evaluation in the co-funded calls must be done on the basis of the same award criteria
that are used for Horizon Europe calls, i.e.:
(a) Excellence
(b) Impact
(c) Quality and efficiency of the implementation.
418EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The aspects to be taken into account for each award criterion should also be the same used
for Horizon Europe proposals. Depending on the type of action, General Annex D of the HE
Work Programme should be applied.
5. Two-step selection procedure (HE)
The selection procedure of the co-funded calls must follow a two-step procedure, ensuring
for:
Step 1: review at national or transnational level (including national eligibility checks)
Step 2: single international peer review
and that in Step 2:
– proposals must be evaluated with the assistance of at least three independent
experts
– proposals must be ranked according to the evaluation results and the selection
must be made on the basis of this ranking
– the selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer, who
must make a report.
Only entities/consortia that are eligible for funding under BOTH Horizon Europe rules and
national funding rules should be invited to Step 2.
The co-funded calls and projects must in principle comply BOTH with the applicable
Horizon Europe and with the national funding rules of the beneficiaries.
Best practice: Where possible, the beneficiaries are however encouraged to harmonise the
national rules and implementation modalities for their transnational calls (e.g. by using only
Horizon Europe rules as common rules).
Consortia should be allowed to adjust the budget between Steps 1 and 2, in order to balance
the requested funding and available funding per participating EU Member State and HE
associated country.
6. Independent experts — Observers (HE)
In addition to using expert evaluators for the evaluation of the co-funded calls, the
beneficiaries must appoint, for each call, an independent expert as an observer to verify that
the selection procedure meets the requirements (in particular, for the peer review evaluation
and the ranking).
The observer’s report must be submitted by the coordinator, as part of the periodic report
(see Article 21.2).
7. Ranking list — Joint selection list (HE)
The beneficiaries must base their selection (joint selection list) on the order of the ranking list
(or the ranking lists, if there are different topics).
If proposals have identical scores, the proposals coming from participating EU Member States
or HE associated countries with still available funding can be given precedence, in order to
maximise the number of selected projects.
The ranking list(s) and the joint selection list must be submitted by the coordinator, as part
of the periodic report (see Article 21.2).
419EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
8. Project implementation — Extension of obligations under the Grant Agreement
to final recipients (HE)
The implementation of the transnational projects by final recipients will follow in principle the
rules of the cascade grant agreements they sign with the beneficiaries (e.g. usually national
rules, but they can also decide to use Horizon Europe rules as common rules for those
agreements).
In all cases, the beneficiaries must ensure that the users comply with certain obligations from
the EU grant (see Article 9.4).
Obligations that must be extended to recipients:
▪ Avoiding conflict of interest (see Article 12)
▪ Confidentiality and security obligations (see Article 13)
▪ Ethics and values (see Article 14)
▪ Give visibility to the EU funding as appropriate (see Article 17.2)
▪ Respect specific rules for the action implementation (see Article 18)
▪ Information obligations (see Article 19)
▪ Record-keeping (see Article 20).
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are respected by the final
recipients (e.g. through the cascade grant agreement).
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g.
granting authority, the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office
(OLAF)) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations on the
recipients, and in particular to audit the payments received. If access is denied by the
recipient, the costs will be rejected.
420EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
General > Annex 5 > HE ERC Grants
Specific rules for ERC Grants (HE)
[OPTION for HE ERC Grants: Specific rules for ERC Grants
When implementing ERC Grants, the beneficiaries must ensure that the action tasks described in Annex 1 are
performed under the guidance of the principal investigator.
In accordance with Article 21, beneficiaries must submit progress reports (scientific reports) and periodic
reports according to the schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Points 4.1 and 4.2). Reports
must be prepared using the templates available in the Portal (ERC scientific and periodic reports).
The internal arrangements set out in Article 7 must cover the decision making procedures for scientific and
grant management issues, the distribution of the EU contribution, internal dispute settlement and division of
responsibilities for cases of rejection of costs or reduction of the grant.
In addition to the obligations set out in Article 17, communication and dissemination activities as well as
infrastructure, equipment or major results funded by the grant mustmoreover display the following special
logo:
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the following conditions for the principal investigator and their
team:
- host and engage the principal investigator for the whole duration of the action
- take all measures to implement the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers — in
particular regarding working conditions, transparent recruitment processes based on merit and career
development — and ensure that the principal investigator, researchers and third parties involved in the
action are aware of them
- enter — before grant signature — into a Supplementary Agreement with the principal investigator,
that specifies:
- the obligation of the beneficiary to meet its obligations under the Grant Agreement
- the obligation of the principal investigator to supervise the scientific and technological
implementation of the action
- the obligation of the principal investigator to assume the responsibility for the scientific
reporting for the beneficiary and contribute to the periodic reporting
- the obligation of the principal investigator to meet the time commitments for implementing
the action and for working in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe associated country, as
set out in Annex 1
- the obligation of the principal investigator to apply the beneficiary’s usual management
practices
421EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- the obligation of the principal investigator to inform the beneficiary immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect the Grant Agreement, such as:
- a planned portability of the grant (or part of it) to a new beneficiary (see Articles 32.2,
39, 40, 41)
- any personal grounds affecting the implementation of the action
- any changes in the information that was used as a basis for signing the supplementary
agreement
- any changes in the information that was used as a basis for awarding the grant
- the obligation of the principal investigator to ensure the visibility of EU funding in
communications or publications and in applications for the protection of results (see Article
16 and 17)
- the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights — during the implementation of
the action and afterwards —, in particular, the obligation of the principal investigator to
uphold the intellectual property rights of the beneficiary and full access — on a royalty-free
basis — for the principal investigator to background and results needed for their activities
under the action
- the obligation of the principal investigator to maintain confidentiality (see Article 13)
- for portability of the grant to a new beneficiary (see Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41):
- the right of the principal investigator to request the portability of the grant, provided that
the objectives of the action remain achievable
- the obligation of the principal investigator to:
- propose to the coordinator (in writing) to what extent the action will be transferred
and the details of the transfer arrangement
- provide a statement to the coordinator with the detailed results of the research up to
the time of transfer
- the right of the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court of
Auditors (ECA), etc.) to exercise their rights also towards the principal investigator
- the applicable law and the dispute settlement forum
- provide the principal investigator with a copy of the signed Agreement
- guarantee the principal investigator scientific independence, in particular for the:
- use of the budget to achieve the scientific objectives
- authority to publish as senior author and invite as co-authors those who have contributed
substantially to the work
- preparation of scientific reports for the action
- selection and supervision of the other team members, in line with the profiles needed to
conduct the research and in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual management practices
- possibility to apply independently for funding
- access to appropriate space and facilities for conducting the research
- provide — during the implementation of the action — research support to the principal investigator
and the team members (regarding infrastructure, equipment, access rights, products and other
services necessary for conducting the research)
- support the principal investigator and provide administrative assistance, in particular for the:
- general management of the work and their team
- scientific reporting, especially ensuring that the team members send their scientific results
to the principal investigator
422EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
- periodic reporting, especially providing timely and clear financial information (for actual
costs)
- application of the beneficiary’s usual management practices
- general logistics of the action
- access to the electronic exchange system
- inform the principal investigator immediately (in writing) of any events or circumstances likely to
affect the Agreement
- ensure that the principal investigator enjoys adequate:
- conditions for annual, sickness and parental leave
- occupational health and safety standards
- insurance under the general social security scheme, such as pension rights
- allow (for both mono and multi-beneficiary actions) the portability of the grant to a new beneficiary,
if requested by the principal investigator and provided that the objectives of the action remain
achievable (see Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41). The beneficiary may object only on the basis that the
portability of the grant is not possible under national law. In particular, the beneficiary must:
- agree with the principal investigator and the new beneficiary on a plan for the transfer of the
intellectual property rights under the Agreement to the new beneficiary
- transfer to the new beneficiary any part of the pre-financing received which is not covered by
an approved periodic report, if requested by the granting authority
- transfer to the new beneficiary the equipment purchased and used exclusively for the action
— against reimbursement of the costs that have not yet been depreciated (for actual cost
grants) or under fair and reasonable conditions agreed among the concerned beneficiaries (for
lump sum grants) — if requested by the principal investigator and the granting authority, and
unless the transfer is not possible under national law.
For ERC Grants with more than one principal investigator, the above-mentioned obligations must be ensured
by each beneficiary towards their principal investigators and their teams (and by each principal investigator
towards their beneficiary, the coordinator and the other principal investigators). Moreover, the following
specificities must be observed:
- for the implementation of the action: the corresponding principal investigator bears the overall
responsibility for the supervision of the scientific and technological implementation of the action,
while the other principal investigators must contribute to the overall implementation and supervise
each one their parts
- for the reporting: the corresponding principal investigator assumes the primary responsibility for the
scientific reporting and contribution to the periodic reporting, while the other principal investigators
must contribute to both the scientific and periodic reporting
- for events or circumstances likely to affect the Agreement: each principal investigator must inform
the coordinator, their beneficiary and the other principal investigators
- for portability of the grant by one of the principal investigators (Articles 32.2, 39, 40, 41):
- the corresponding principal investigator must verify that the beneficiary of the principal
investigator and the coordinator were informed
- the principal investigator concerned must provide the coordinator and their beneficiary with a
statement on the detailed results of the research up to the time of transfer
- for the internal arrangements (Article 7): they must also cover settlement of disputes between the
principal investigators and between them and the beneficiaries).
For ERC Proof of Concept Grants, the specific rules on reporting (scientific and periodic reporting) and the
special conditions for the principal investigator and their team do not apply.]
423EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
1. Specific rules for ERC Grants (HE)
The specific rules for ERC Grants apply to all HE ERC types of action (i.e. calls with ERC ToA,
including ERC SyG and ERC PoC).
ERC types of action that use actual costs also have two special cost categories in
Article 6.2.D.7 and 6.2.D.8.
2. Actions under the guidance of the principal investigator (PI) (HE)
ERC Grants are designed to attract excellence in fundamental research and focus on principal
investigators (PIs).
PIs do not become party to the Grant Agreement, but they are the key actors, in charge of
the research activities. The host institution which hosts and engages the PI is the one that
must apply for the ERC Grant (and will act as coordinator, in case of multi-beneficiary
grants).
For ERC Synergy Grants (SyG), there might be several host institutions (beneficiaries
hosting and engaging a PI). In this case, the coordinator will be the entity hosting and
engaging the corresponding PI, who will be the administrative contact point for the group of
PIs.
The host institution becomes the signatory of the Grant Agreement and formally subscribes
to the legal and financial obligations under it.
The hosting institution must ensure that the action is performed under the guidance of the PI.
Due to the key role of the PI, they can NOT be replaced by any other researcher during the
action. Requests for amendments to change the PI will be rejected.
Combining ERC & other EU grants — ERC grants do NOT prevent PIs from applying
independently (i.e. in their own name) for further EU funding for other actions or for the same
action, but for costs that are not eligible (or not declared) under the ERC grant.
The fact that the funding rate for ERC grants is 100% does not mean that the grant pays for
100% of the costs of the ERC action. Therefore, cost items not declared under the ERC grant may
be covered by other EU funding.
2. Scientific and financial reporting (HE)
The ERC Grant Agreements set out different reporting periods for the financial and scientific
reporting.
The financial reporting corresponds to the periodic reporting in standard EU grants. The
scientific reporting is a special form of progress reporting.
The scientific reporting is done separately from the periodic reporting (i.e. in addition to the
financial reports which are needed to receive interim and final payments).
Normally, the two types of reports alternate between them. At the end of the action, they are
submitted together in a single periodic report, in order to receive the final payment.
For ERC Starting Grants, Consolidator Grants and Advanced Grants, where the usual duration
is 60 months, the first scientific report is submitted after 24 months, while the first periodic
(financial) report is submitted after 30 months. Depending on the overall duration of the
action the periodicity may change.
424EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
For ERC Synergy Grants, where the normal duration is 72 months, the scientific reports are
expected at month 24, 48 and 72, whereas the periodic (financial) reports are expected at
month 18, 36, 54 and 72.
Scientific reports (progress reports):
The scientific reports must be submitted through the Portal (Scientific Reporting tool).
These scientific reports include:
– information about the scientific progress of the work
– the achievements and results of the action
– information on whether and how open access has been provided to the results
– information on how the results have been disseminated
– a summary of the achievements of the action, for publication by the granting
authority.
Financial reports (periodic reports):
The financial reports are available directly through the Portal (Periodic Reporting tool).
These financial reports include:
– an overview of the action implementation indicating in particular any significant
deviation in relation to the DoA Annex 1
– a narrative containing information on the eligible costs, including an explanation on
the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
– an individual financial statement
– a consolidated financial statement, created automatically by the IT system (on the
basis of all financial statements submitted by the beneficiaries and affiliated entities
for the reporting period), which counts as the request of payment
– the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (when required by the Grant
Agreement; see Article 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3).
3. Host and engage the PI (HE)
The principal investigator must be hosted and engaged by the host institution, for the whole
duration of the action.
This obligation is also an eligibility criterion for ERC actions. Like all eligibility criteria, it
must be fulfilled for the entire duration of the action (see Article 7) — otherwise the
action may have to be terminated (see Article 32).
Normally the PI will be employed by the host institution, but there may be cases where the
PI’s employer is a third party who makes the PI available to work for the host institution,
where the PI is self-employed, or where the PI has a particular status in the HI (e.g.
‘emeritus’).
The specific conditions of engagement (which normally should be similar to those of an
employee of the host institution) will be subject to clarification and approval by the granting
authority during the grant preparation (or in case of an amendment request).
425EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
4. Supplementary agreement (HE)
The host institution must — before grant signature — conclude a supplementary agreement
(SA) with the principal investigator.
The ‘Supplementary Agreement (SA)’ is an agreement between the host institution and the
principal investigator to set out their internal arrangements for implementing the grant and
govern their relationship during the ERC action.
The supplementary agreement is NOT intended to replace the employment/engagement
contract.
It should cover all the practical issues that may arise in the context of the grant
implementation and must remain in place at least for the action duration (— without any
interruptions). For ERC Synergy grants (i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs),
each host institution must conclude a supplementary agreement with the PI(s) it engages.
The supplementary agreement must be concluded before grant signature (or in case of
portability before submission of the amendment request) and have the following minimum
content:
Main obligations (towards the PI):
▪ Host and engage the PI for the whole duration of the action
▪ Scientific independence, to achieve the action’s objectives under the best possible
conditions, and within the time agreed
▪ Research support, to conduct the research as described in the Grant Agreement
▪ Access to and protection of intellectual property rights
▪ Adequate working conditions, always in accordance with national law and
institutional rules
▪ Administrative support, to manage the legal and financial aspect of the action
▪ Grant portability, allowing and facilitating the transfer of the grant to another host
institution.
Main obligations (of the PI):
▪ Supervision of the scientific and technological implementation of the action
▪ Responsibility for the scientific reporting and contribution to the financial reporting
▪ Meeting the time commitment for implementing the action (see below”)
▪ Applying the host institution’s usual management practices (in particular,
regarding the way the work is organised, the premises where it is carried out, and
the manner in which it is supervised)
▪ Informing the host institution immediately of any events or circumstances likely to
affect the Grant Agreement
▪ Ensure the visibility of EU funding
▪ Upholding the intellectual property rights of the beneficiaries
This obligation is not limited to respecting the host institution’s intellectual
property rights (IPRs). The PI must actively inform it, if they become aware of any
violations.
426EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Example: The PI reads a research article and discovers a violation of the host institution’s
project IPRs. They are obliged to inform the host institution.
▪ Maintaining confidentiality.
A template for a model supplementary agreement is available on the ERC website. The model
is not mandatory; beneficiaries may use other clauses, provided they benefit the research
action and do not contradict the Grant Agreement (e.g. if the supplementary agreement
contains additional provisions concerning intellectual property, they must allow the host
institution to comply with its obligations under Article 16 of the Grant Agreement).
The granting authority is NOT party to the supplementary agreement and has NO responsibility
for it (nor for any adverse consequences).
It must NOT contain any provisions contrary to the Grant Agreement. Contradicting provisions are
considered void and cannot be opposed to the granting authority.
5. PI time commitments (HE)
The host institution must make sure that the principal investigator ensures a sufficient time
commitment and presence throughout the action, to guarantee its proper implementation.
The host institution must in particular make sure that the PI complies with the minimum
requirements set out in the DoA Annex 1 regarding working time on the action and working
time in an EU Member State or HE associated country.
These two time commitment obligations are as follows:
- % of working time that the PI must work on the action
- % of working time that the PI must work in an EU Member State or HE associated
country.
To be operational, these two percentages must be translated into working days, i.e.:
- minimum number of days that the PI must work in the action over its duration
- minimum number of days that the PI must work in an EU Member State or HE
associated country over the duration of the action.
The calculation should be done as follows:
Step 1 — For each year of the action, the percentages of PI commitment are applied to
215 fixed annual days.
The 215 fixed annual days work as a ceiling: they apply even if the PI works in total
more days (i.e. has other parallel affiliations, freelance activities or work-related
obligations or works more days on the action). In this case, the time commitment is
capped at 100% and the days are calculated on the 215 fixed annual days.
By contrast, if the PI works in total less days than the 215 fixed annual days, the time
commitment obligation will be reduced proportionally (e.g. in cases of part-time
employment, maternity leave, sick leave…).
The total work of the PI will be determined by adding up all their days of remunerated
work, including under contracts with entities other than the host institution.
Example: The % of PI commitment to the ERC action is 50%. The PI works 129 annual days at
the host institution and has another contract with a different entity to work 35 days over the
year. The days that the PI works in total are 164 days (129 + 35). Since this amount is lower
than the 215 fixed annual days, the time commitment obligation will be: 164 x 50 % = 82 days
427EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
Step 2 — Sum up the results for each year of Step 1 to get the total number of days over
the action duration.
The percentages must be reached for the overall action duration (NOT annually or per
reporting period).
The PI's time commitments obligations must ALWAYS be fulfilled — even if no personnel
costs are charged for them to the project.
6. Transfer of the GA (portability) (HE)
Portability means that the PIs have a right to request the transfer of their grant to a new host
institution — provided that the objectives of the action remain achievable and that the new
host institution meets the eligibility criteria set out in the ERC work programme/call
conditions.
Portability allows the PI to request the transfer of the entire grant or part of it, and it applies
both in case of mono-beneficiary grants and multi-beneficiary grants. In ERC Synergy Grants
(i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs), each PI has the right to transfer their part
of the action. They must inform and consult the other PIs, to ensure that the action’s
objectives can still be achieved.
ERC grants can thus be transferred to a new host institution (‘new beneficiary’) — at any time
during the action.
Transfers without a formal amendment are void and may result in grant termination. The
former host institution remains fully responsible until the granting authority has approved the
amendment.
The transfer may be based on any ground that is beneficial for the PI and does not affect the
achievement of the action’s objectives.
The transfer may be refused, if the objectives of the action do not remain achievable or if
there is an issue with eligibility (e.g. if the PI requests a transfer to an institution established
in a non-associated third country). In this case the Grant Agreement may be terminated (see
Article 32). Exceptions, in line with the applicable ERC work programme/call conditions, may
apply for ERC Synergy Grants.
In addition, the former host institution (‘former beneficiary’) may oppose a transfer if it is not
allowed under national law.
The transfer conditions (including transfer of team members, intellectual property rights and
equipment) should be negotiated with the new host institution, taking into account the views
of the PI.
Amendment procedure:
Portability transfers are done directly in the Portal Amendment tool as in/out amendment
(AT4 beneficiary termination is combined with AT1 Addition of a new beneficiary; see Article
39; new for 2021-2027).
The procedure is therefore in principle the one for consortium-initiated partner terminations
(see Article 32).
The PI should first contact the host institution that signed the Grant Agreement (i.e. the
former host institution).
Best practice: Both the beneficiaries and the PI should keep records of the consultation and
decision-making process for each portability case.
428EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
The former host institution must submit a request for amendment to the granting authority
(see Article 39). The amendment should normally cover both the termination of the old host
institution and the addition of the new host institution.
The termination/addition may exceptionally (and in duly justified cases) not be necessary,
if the old host institution remains in the action as normal beneficiary (and the action becomes
a multi-beneficiary action), but in this case the amendment will have to do a change of
coordinator to change the roles (AT11).
The transfer date must be indicated in the amendment request. If the new host institution
joins the action, the transfer date must be the same date as the accession date. Retroactive
dates may be accepted only in exceptional cases, if duly justified.
In addition, the financial reporting periods may be adapted to match the transfer date (can
be done in the same amendment). The scientific reporting periods will usually remain
unchanged (since the transfer normally has no effect on the scientific implementation of the
action).
For more guidance on amendments, see the Amendment Guide and the Online Manual >
Amendments.
Effects:
The effects are also those of consortium-initiated partner terminations (see Article 32).
The host institution must — within 60 days from either the transfer date or the date of
signature of the amendment whichever is the latest — submit:
− a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned (only in case of
multi-beneficiary grants)
− a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period
until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the financial
statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the certificate
on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
The documents will be used for calculating the next payment due to the former beneficiary.
The granting authority will moreover instruct the former host institution to transfer the
remaining pre-financing to the new host institution.
If the PI requests it, the granting authority may also require the former host institution to
transfer equipment that was purchased and used exclusively for the action.
The former host institution may oppose this only if it is not possible under national law. It
may however negotiate transfer conditions with the new host institution, taking into account
the views of the PI.
Thus, the new host institution should make its best effort to buy the equipment fully used for
the project. If it does so, it may declare the costs of this purchase (and any other related
costs, i.e. dismantling, transfer and installation), if they fulfil the eligibility conditions set out
in Article 6. In particular, the purchase price should not be higher than the net accounting
value of the equipment at the former host institution (i.e. initial value of the asset minus
depreciation incurred until the transfer).
Specific cases (ERC):
PI employed by a third party — The PI may be employed not by the host institution but by
a third party (from an EU Member State or HE associated country), i.e.:
− a third party that provides the PI as in-kind contribution or
429EU Grants: AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement: V2.0– 01.04.2025
− an affiliated entity.
This must be specifically justified in the proposal (or amendment request) and included in the
DoA Annex 1.
In this case, the supplementary agreement should be signed by the PI, the host institution
and the third party employing the PI.
Retired PI — The PI may be retired. In this case, there must still be an ‘engagement’
relationship, comparable to an employment relationship, between the PI and the host
institution, ensuring that the PI will have the scientific independence and the necessary rights
to supervise the research and the team, and comply with the rights and obligations specified
in the Grant Agreement.
PI who is also the representative of the host institution— If the PI is at the same time
the representative of the host institution entitled to sign the supplementary agreement on
behalf of the host institution (because of their position in the institution), the supplementary
agreement must be counter-signed by another person empowered by the institution. The PI
can NOT sign their own supplementary agreement for both sides.
Portability — If the Grant Agreement is transferred to another host institution, a new
supplementary agreement must be signed with the new host institution. The new
supplementary agreement must take effect from the grant transfer date (or before). The
Grant Agreement cannot be amended before the new supplementary agreement has been
provided to the granting authority.
Former host institution remains beneficiary — If certain team members (or equipment)
stay with the former host institution, while the PI moves to a new host institution, the Grant
Agreement is transferred and changed into a multi-beneficiary grant (allowing both the
former host institution and the new host institution to participate in the grant). The former
host institution stays on as beneficiary, the organisation that hosts and engages the PI is the
new host institution.
If the former host institution remains only for a limited time (e.g. to ensure a smooth
handover), it can then be terminated at a later stage (see Article 32).
Recruitment costs — The host institution must guarantee the PI scientific independence to
select the other team members. Thus, for ERC actions, recruitment costs, if clearly
attributable to the action, are eligible as ‘other direct costs’, even for the unsuccessful
candidates (because recruitment is part of the action activities).
Purchase of scientific publications — The host institution must provide research support
to the PI regarding any equipment, products or services necessary for conducting the
research. Consequently, costs related to the purchase of scientific publications (e.g. books,
manuscripts, articles, digital copies, etc) may be eligible, if their direct link to the action and
their necessity for the action is demonstrated.
Costs for ‘teaching buy-outs’ — The host institution must support the PI and provide
administrative assistance. However, if the host institution hires substitutes to perform some
of the PI’s duties that are not linked to the ERC grant (e.g. teaching), these costs are NOT
eligible.

ERC Work Programme and the call and topics pages of the ERC calls.

on the European Charter for Researchers
and on a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment
of Researchers
The Commission ofthe European Communities
Having regard to the Treatyestablishing the European Community, and in
particular Article 165 thereof
Whereas
(1) The Commission considered itnecessaryin January2000 1to estab-
lish the European Research Area asthe linchpin ofthe Community’s
future action in thisfield with a view to consolidating and giving struc-
ture to a European research policy.
(2) The Lisbon European Council set the Community the objective of
becoming the mostcompetitive and dynamicknowledge economyin
the world by2010.
(3) The Councilhasaddressed issuesrelated to the profession and the
career ofresearcherswithin the European Research Area in itsResolution
of10 November 2003 2and welcomed in particular the Commission’s
intention to worktowardsthe developmentofa European Researcher’s
Charter and a Code ofConductfor the RecruitmentofResearchers.

the profession and the career ofresearcherswithin the European Research Area).
3(4) The identified potentialshortage ofresearchers3, particularlyin cer-
tain key disciplines, will pose a serious threat to EU’s innovative
strength, knowledge capacity and productivity growth in the near
future and mayhamper the attainmentofthe Lisbon and Barcelona
objectives. Consequently, Europe must dramatically improve its
attractiveness to researchers and strengthen the participation of
women researchersbyhelping to create the necessaryconditionsfor
more sustainable and appealing careersfor them in R&D 4.
(5) Sufficientand well-developed human resourcesin R&D are the cor-
nerstone of advancement in scientific knowledge, technological
progress, enhancing the qualityoflife, ensuring the welfare ofEuro-
pean citizensand contributing to Europe’scompetitiveness.
(6) New instrumentsfor the career developmentofresearchersshould be
introduced and implemented, thuscontributing to the improvement
ofcareer prospectsfor researchersin Europe.
(7) Enhanced and more visible career prospectsalso contribute to the
building of a positive public attitude towards the researchers’ pro-
fession, and thereby encourage more young people to embarkon
careersin research.
(8) The ultimate politicalgoalofthisRecommendation isto contribute to
the development of an attractive, open and sustainable European
labour marketfor researchers, where the frameworkconditionsallow
for recruiting and retaining high qualityresearchersin environments
conducive to effective performance and productivity.
(9) Member States should endeavour to offer researchers sustainable
career developmentsystemsatallcareer stages, regardlessoftheir
contractualsituation and ofthe chosen R&D career path, and they

4should endeavour to ensure thatresearchersare treated asprofes-
sionalsand asan integralpartofthe institutionsin which theywork.
(10) Even though Member Stateshave made considerable effortsto over-
come administrative and legalobstaclesto geographicaland inter-
sectoralmobility, manyofthese obstaclesstillremain.
(11) Allformsofmobilityshould be encouraged aspartofa comprehen-
sive human resource policyin R&D atnational, regionaland institu-
tionallevel.
(12) The value ofallformsofmobilityneedsto be fullyrecognised in the
career appraisal and career advancement systems for researchers,
thusguaranteeing thatsuch an experience isconducive to their pro-
fessionaldevelopment.
(13) The development of a consistent career and mobility policy for
researchersto 5and from the European Union should be considered
with regard to the situation in developing countriesand regionswithin
and outside Europe, so thatbuilding research capacitieswithin the
European Union does not occur at the expense of less developed
countriesor regions.
(14) Fundersor employersofresearchersin their role asrecruitersshould
be responsible for providing researcherswith open, transparentand
internationallycomparable selection and recruitmentprocedures.
(15) Societyshould appreciate more fullythe responsibilitiesand the pro-
fessionalism thatresearchersdemonstrate in executing their workat
different stages of their careers and in their multi-faceted role as
knowledge workers, leaders, projectcoordinators, managers, super-
visors, mentors, career advisorsor science communicators.

respective national, regionalor sectorallegislation requirements.
(17) ThisRecommendation providesMember States, employers, funders
and researcherswith a valuable instrumentto undertake, on a vo-
luntarybasis, further initiativesfor the improvementand consolidation
ofresearchers’ career prospectsin the European Union and for the
creation ofan open labour marketfor researchers.
(18) The generalprinciplesand requirementsoutlined in thisRecommen-
dation are the fruits of a public consultation process to which the
members of the Steering Group on Human Resources and Mobility
have been fullyassociated,
Herebyrecommends:
1. ThatMember Statesendeavour to undertake the necessarystepsto
ensure thatemployersor fundersofresearchersdevelop and main-
tain a supportive research environmentand working culture, where
individuals and research groups are valued, encouraged and sup-
ported, and provided with the necessarymaterialand intangible sup-
port to enable them to fulfil their objectives and tasks. Within this
context, particular priority should be given to the organisation of
working and training conditionsin the earlystage ofthe researchers’
careers, asitcontributesto the future choicesand attractivenessof
a career in R&D.
2. ThatMember Statesendeavour to take, wherever necessary, the cru-
cialstepsto ensure thatemployersor fundersofresearchersimprove
the recruitmentmethodsand career evaluation/appraisalsystemsin
order to create a more transparent, open, equaland internationally
accepted system of recruitment and career development as a pre-
requisite for a genuine European labour marketfor researchers.
63. That Member States - as they formulate and adopt their strategies
and systemsfor developing sustainable careersfor researchers- take
duly into account and are guided by the general principles and
requirements, referred to asThe European Charter for Researchers
and the Code ofConductfor the RecruitmentofResearchersoutlined
in the Annex.
4. ThatMember Statesendeavour to transpose these generalprinciples
and requirementswithin their area ofresponsibilityinto nationalre-
gulatoryframeworksor sectoraland/or institutionalstandardsand
guidelines(chartersand/or codesfor researchers). In so doing they
should take into accountthe greatdiversityofthe laws, regulations
and practiceswhich, in differentcountriesand in differentsectors,
determine the path, organisation and working conditionsofa career
in R&D.
5. That Member States consider such general principles and require-
ments as an integral part of institutional quality assurance mecha-
nismsbyregarding them asa meansfor establishing funding criteria
for national/regionalfunding schemes, aswellasadopting them for
the auditing, monitoring and evaluation processesofpublicbodies.
6. ThatMember Statescontinue their effortsto overcome the persisting
legaland administrative obstaclesto mobility, including those related
to intersectoral mobility and mobility between and within different
functions, taking into accountan enlarged European Union.
7. ThatMember Statesendeavour to ensure thatresearchersenjoyade-
quate socialsecuritycoverage according to their legalstatus. Within
thiscontext, particular attention should be paid to the portabilityof
pension rights, either statutory or supplementary, for researchers
moving within the publicand private sectorsin the same countryand
also for those moving across borders within the European Union.
Such regimesshould guarantee thatresearcherswho, in the course
7oftheir lives, change jobsor interrupttheir careersdo notundulysuf-
fer a lossofsocialsecurityrights.
8. ThatMember Statesputin place the necessarymonitoring structures
to review thisRecommendation regularly, aswellasto measure the
extentto which employers, fundersand researchershave applied the
European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the
RecruitmentofResearchers.
9. That the criteria for measuring this will be established and agreed
with the Member Stateswithin the contextofthe workundertaken by
the Steering Group on Human Resourcesand Mobility.
10. That Member States in their role as representatives in the interna-
tionalorganisationsestablished atintergovernmentalleveltake due
accountofthisRecommendation when proposing strategiesand tak-
ing decisionsconcerning the activitiesofthose organisations.
11. This Recommendation is addressed to the Member States but it is
also intended asan instrumentto encourage socialdialogue, aswell
asdialogue among researchers, stakeholdersand societyatlarge.
12. The Member Statesare invited to inform the Commission, asfar as
possible, by 15th December 2005 and annually thereafter of any
measures they have taken further to this Recommendation, and to
inform it of the first results of its application as well as to provide
examplesofgood practice.
13. ThisRecommendation willbe reviewed periodicallybythe Commis-
sion in the contextofthe Open Method ofCoordination.

8ANNEX
Section 1
The European CharterforResearchers
The European Charter for Researchersisa setofgeneralprinciplesand
requirementswhich specifiesthe roles, responsibilitiesand entitlements
of researchers as well as of employers and/or funders of researchers6.
The aim of the Charter is to ensure that the nature of the relationship
between researchersand employersor fundersisconducive to successful
performance in generating, transferring, sharing and disseminating
knowledge and technological development, and to the career develop-
mentofresearchers. The Charter also recognizesthe value ofallformsof
mobility as a means for enhancing the professional development of
researchers.
In thissense, the Charter constitutesa frameworkfor researchers, employers
and funderswhich invitesthem to actresponsiblyand asprofessionals
within their working environment, and to recognise each other assuch.
The Charter addressesallresearchersin the European Union atallstages
oftheir career and coversallfieldsofresearch in the publicand private
sectors, irrespective ofthe nature ofthe appointmentor employment7, the
legalstatusoftheir employer or the type oforganisation or establishment
in which the workiscarried out. Ittakesinto accountthe multiple rolesof
researchers, who are appointed not only to conduct research and/or to
carryoutdevelopmentactivitiesbutare also involved in supervision, men-
toring, managementor administrative tasks.
6 See definition in Section 3.
7 See definition in Section 3.
9This Charter takes as its premise that researchers as well as employers
and/or fundersofresearchershave an overriding obligation to ensure that
theymeetthe requirementsofthe respective nationalor regionallegisla-
tion. Where researchers enjoy a status and rights which are, in certain
respects, more favourable than those provided for in thisCharter, itsterms
should notbe invoked to diminish the statusand rightsalreadyacquired.
Researchers, aswellasemployersand funders, who adhere to thisChar-
ter willalso be respecting the fundamentalrightsand observe the prin-
ciplesrecognised bythe Charter ofFundamentalRightsofthe European
Union 8.

10General Principles and Requirements
applicable to Researchers:
Research Freedom
Researchersshould focustheir research for the good ofmankind and for
expanding the frontiersofscientificknowledge, while enjoying the free-
dom ofthoughtand expression, and the freedom to identifymethodsby
which problemsare solved, according to recognised ethicalprinciplesand
practices.
Researchers should, however, recognise the limitations to this freedom
thatcould arise asa resultofparticular research circumstances(including
supervision/guidance/management) or operational constraints, e.g. for
budgetaryor infrastructuralreasonsor, especiallyin the industrialsector,
for reasons of intellectual property protection. Such limitations should
not, however, contravene recognised ethicalprinciplesand practices, to
which researchershave to adhere.
Ethicalprinciples
Researchersshould adhere to the recognised ethicalpracticesand fun-
damentalethicalprinciplesappropriate to their discipline(s) aswellasto
ethicalstandardsasdocumented in the differentnational, sectoralor insti-
tutionalCodesofEthics.
Professionalresponsibility
Researchersshould make everyeffortto ensure thattheir research isre-
levantto societyand doesnotduplicate research previouslycarried out
elsewhere.
11Theymustavoid plagiarism ofanykind and abide bythe principle ofintel-
lectualpropertyand jointdata ownership in the case ofresearch carried
out in collaboration with a supervisor(s) and/or other researchers. The
need to validate new observationsbyshowing thatexperimentsare repro-
ducible should notbe interpreted asplagiarism, provided thatthe data to
be confirmed are explicitlyquoted.
Researchersshould ensure, ifanyaspectoftheir workisdelegated, that
the person to whom itisdelegated hasthe competence to carryitout.
Professionalattitude
Researchers should be familiar with the strategic goals governing their
research environmentand funding mechanisms, and should seekallne-
cessaryapprovalsbefore starting their research or accessing the resources
provided.
They should inform their employers, funders or supervisor when their
research projectisdelayed, redefined or completed, or give notice ifitis
to be terminated earlier or suspended for whatever reason.
Contractualand legalobligations
Researchers at all levels must be familiar with the national, sectoral or
institutional regulations governing training and/or working conditions.
This includes Intellectual Property Rights regulations, and the require-
ments and conditions of any sponsor or funders, independently of the
nature oftheir contract. Researchersshould adhere to such regulationsby
delivering the required results(e.g. thesis, publications, patents, reports,
new productsdevelopment, etc) assetoutin the termsand conditionsof
the contractor equivalentdocument.
12Accountability
Researchers need to be aware that they are accountable towards their
employers, fundersor other related publicor private bodiesaswellas, on
more ethical grounds, towards society as a whole. In particular,
researchersfunded bypublicfundsare also accountable for the efficient
use oftaxpayers’ money. Consequently, theyshould adhere to the prin-
ciplesofsound, transparentand efficientfinancialmanagementand co-
operate with anyauthorised auditsoftheir research, whether undertaken
bytheir employers/fundersor byethicscommittees.
Methodsofcollection and analysis, the outputsand, where applicable,
detailsofthe data should be open to internaland externalscrutiny, when-
ever necessaryand asrequested bythe appropriate authorities.
Good practice in research
Researchersshould atalltimesadoptsafe working practices, in line with
nationallegislation, including taking the necessaryprecautionsfor health
and safetyand for recoveryfrom information technologydisasters, e.g. by
preparing proper back-up strategies. Theyshould also be familiar with the
currentnationallegalrequirementsregarding data protection and confi-
dentialityprotection requirements, and undertake the necessarystepsto
fulfilthem atalltimes.
Dissemination, exploitation ofresults
All researchers should ensure, in compliance with their contractual
arrangements, that the results of their research are disseminated and
exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research settingsor,
if appropriate, commercialised. Senior researchers, in particular, are
expected to take a lead in ensuring thatresearch isfruitfuland thatresults
13are either exploited commercially or made accessible to the public (or
both) whenever the opportunityarises.
Publicengagement
Researchersshould ensure thattheir research activitiesare made known
to societyatlarge in such a waythattheycan be understood bynon-spe-
cialists, therebyimproving the public’sunderstanding ofscience. Direct
engagement with the public will help researchers to better understand
publicinterestin prioritiesfor science and technologyand also the pub-
lic’sconcerns.
Relation with supervisors
Researchersin their training phase should establish a structured and re-
gular relationship with their supervisor(s) and faculty/departmentalrep-
resentative(s) so asto take fulladvantage oftheir relationship with them.
Thisincludeskeeping recordsofallworkprogressand research findings,
obtaining feedbackbymeansofreportsand seminars, applying such feed-
backand working in accordance with agreed schedules, milestones, deliv-
erablesand/or research outputs.
Supervision and managerialduties
Senior researchersshould devote particular attention to their multi-faceted
role assupervisors, mentors, career advisors, leaders, projectcoordina-
tors, managers or science communicators. They should perform these
tasksto the highestprofessionalstandards. With regard to their role as
supervisorsor mentorsofresearchers, senior researchersshould build up
a constructive and positive relationship with the early-stage researchers,
in order to setthe conditionsfor efficienttransfer ofknowledge and for the
further successfuldevelopmentofthe researchers’ careers.
14Continuing ProfessionalDevelopment
Researchersatallcareer stagesshould seekto continuallyimprove them-
selvesbyregularlyupdating and expanding their skillsand competencies.
Thismaybe achieved bya varietyofmeansincluding, butnotrestricted to,
formaltraining, workshops, conferencesand e-learning.
15General Principles and Requirements applicable to Employers and
Funders:
Recognition ofthe profession
Allresearchersengaged in a research career should be recognised aspro-
fessionals and be treated accordingly. This should commence at the
beginning of their careers, namely at postgraduate level, and should
include alllevels, regardlessoftheir classification atnationallevel(e.g.
employee, postgraduate student, doctoralcandidate, postdoctoralfellow,
civilservants).
Non-discrimination
Employers and/or funders of researchers will not discriminate against
researchers in any way on the basis of gender, age, ethnic, national or
social origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation, language, disability,
politicalopinion, socialor economiccondition.
Research environment
Employers and/or funders of researchers should ensure that the most
stimulating research or research training environment is created which
offersappropriate equipment, facilitiesand opportunities, including for
remote collaboration over research networks, and thatthe nationalor sec-
toralregulationsconcerning health and safetyin research are observed.
Fundersshould ensure thatadequate resourcesare provided in supportof
the agreed workprogramme.
16Working conditions
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thatthe working conditionsfor
researchers, including for disabled researchers, provide where appropri-
ate the flexibilitydeemed essentialfor successfulresearch performance in
accordance with existing nationallegislation and with nationalor sectoral
collective-bargaining agreements. They should aim to provide working
conditionswhich allow both women and men researchersto combine fam-
ilyand work, children and career 9. Particular attention should be paid,
interalia, to flexible working hours, part-time working, tele-working and
sabbaticalleave, aswellasto the necessaryfinancialand administrative
provisionsgoverning such arrangements.
Stabilityand permanence ofemployment
Employers and/or funders should ensure that the performance of
researchersisnotundermined byinstabilityofemploymentcontracts, and
should therefore committhemselvesasfar aspossible to improving the
stability of employment conditions for researchers, thus implementing
and abiding bythe principlesand termslaid down in the EU Directive on
Fixed-Term Work10.
9 See SEC(2005) 260, Women and Science: Excellence and Innovation – Gender Equalityin
Science.
10 Which aimsto preventfixed-term employeesfrom being treated lessfavourablythan similar
permanentemployees, to preventabuse arising from the use ofsuccessive fixed-term con-
tracts, to improve accessto training for fixed-term employeesand to ensure thatfixed-term
employeesare informed aboutavailable permanentjobs. CouncilDirective 1999/70/ECcon-
cerning the “FrameworkAgreementon fixed-term work” concluded byETUC, UNICEand CEEP,
adopted on 28 June 1999.
17Funding and salaries
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould ensure thatresearchers
enjoyfair and attractive conditionsoffunding and/or salarieswith ade-
quate and equitable social security provisions (including sickness and
parentalbenefits, pension rightsand unemploymentbenefits) in accor-
dance with existing nationallegislation and with nationalor sectoralcol-
lective bargaining agreements. Thismustinclude researchersatallcareer
stagesincluding early-stage researchers, commensurate with their legal
status, performance and levelofqualificationsand/or responsibilities.
Gender balance 11
Employersand/or fundersshould aim for a representative gender balance
atalllevelsofstaff, including atsupervisoryand manageriallevel. This
should be achieved on the basisofan equalopportunitypolicyatrecruit-
mentand atthe subsequentcareer stageswithout, however, taking prece-
dence over qualityand competence criteria. To ensure equaltreatment,
selection and evaluation committees should have an adequate gender
balance.
Career development
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould draw up, preferablywithin
the frameworkoftheir human resourcesmanagement, a specificcareer
developmentstrategyfor researchersatallstagesoftheir career, regard-
lessoftheir contractualsituation, including for researcherson fixed-term
contracts. Itshould include the availabilityofmentorsinvolved in provi-
ding supportand guidance for the personaland professionaldevelopment
of researchers, thus motivating them and contributing to reducing any
11 See SEC(2005) 260, Women and Science: Excellence and Innovation – Gender Equalityin
Science.
18insecurity in their professional future. All researchers should be made
familiar with such provisionsand arrangements.
Value ofmobility
Employersand/or fundersmustrecognise the value ofgeographical, inter-
sectoral, inter- and trans-disciplinaryand virtual12mobilityaswellasmobi-
lity between the public and private sector as an important means of
enhancing scientificknowledge and professionaldevelopmentatanystage
ofa researcher’scareer. Consequently, theyshould build such optionsinto
the specificcareer developmentstrategyand fullyvalue and acknowledge
anymobilityexperience within their career progression/appraisalsystem.
Thisalso requiresthatthe necessaryadministrative instrumentsbe putin
place to allow the portabilityofboth grantsand socialsecurityprovisions,
in accordance with nationallegislation.
Accessto research training and continuousdevelopment
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thatallresearchersatanystage
of their career, regardless of their contractual situation, are given the
opportunityfor professionaldevelopmentand for improving their employ-
abilitythrough accessto measuresfor the continuing developmentofskills
and competencies.
Such measuresshould be regularlyassessed for their accessibility, take-
up and effectivenessin improving competencies, skillsand employability.
12 i.e. remote collaboration over electronicnetworks.
19Accessto career advice
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thatcareer advice and job place-
mentassistance, either in the institutionsconcerned, or through collabo-
ration with other structures, isoffered to researchersatallstagesoftheir
careers, regardlessoftheir contractualsituation.
IntellectualPropertyRights
Employers and/or funders should ensure that researchers at all career
stagesreap the benefitsofthe exploitation (ifany) oftheir R&D results
through legal protection and, in particular, through appropriate protec-
tion ofIntellectualPropertyRights, including copyrights.
Policies and practices should specify what rights belong to researchers
and/or, where applicable, to their employersor other parties, including
externalcommercialor industrialorganisations, aspossiblyprovided for
under specificcollaboration agreementsor other typesofagreement.
Co-authorship
Co-authorship should be viewed positivelybyinstitutionswhen evaluating
staff, asevidence ofa constructive approach to the conductofresearch.
Employersand/or fundersshould therefore develop strategies, practices
and proceduresto provide researchers, including those atthe beginning
oftheir research careers, with the necessaryframeworkconditionsso that
theycan enjoythe rightto be recognised and listed and/or quoted, in the
contextoftheir actualcontributions, asco-authorsofpapers, patents, etc,
or to publish their own research resultsindependentlyfrom their supervi-
sor(s).
20Supervision
Employersand/or fundersshould ensure thata person isclearlyidentified
to whom early-stage researcherscan refer for the performance oftheir pro-
fessionalduties, and should inform the researchersaccordingly.
Such arrangementsshould clearlydefine thatthe proposed supervisors
are sufficientlyexpertin supervising research, have the time, knowledge,
experience, expertise and commitment to be able to offer the research
trainee appropriate supportand provide for the necessaryprogressand
review procedures, aswellasthe necessaryfeedbackmechanisms.
Teaching
Teaching isan essentialmeansfor the structuring and dissemination of
knowledge and should therefore be considered a valuable option within
the researchers’ career paths. However, teaching responsibilitiesshould
notbe excessive and should notpreventresearchers, particularlyatthe
beginning oftheir careers, from carrying outtheir research activities.
Employers and/or funders should ensure that teaching duties are ade-
quatelyremunerated and taken into accountin the evaluation/appraisal
systems, and thattime devoted bysenior membersofstaffto the training
ofearlystage researchersshould be counted aspartoftheir teaching com-
mitment. Suitable training should be provided for teaching and coaching
activitiesaspartofthe professionaldevelopmentofresearchers.
Evaluation/appraisalsystems
Employersand/or fundersshould introduce for allresearchers, including
senior researchers, evaluation/appraisalsystemsfor assessing their pro-
fessionalperformance on a regular basisand in a transparentmanner by
an independent(and, in the case ofsenior researchers, preferablyinter-
national) committee.
21Such evaluation and appraisal procedures should take due account of
their overall research creativity and research results, e.g. publications,
patents, managementofresearch, teaching/lecturing, supervision, men-
toring, nationalor internationalcollaboration, administrative duties, pub-
lic awareness activities and mobility, and should be taken into
consideration in the contextofcareer progression.
Complaints/appeals
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould establish, in compliance
with nationalrulesand regulations, appropriate procedures, possiblyin
the form of an impartial (ombudsman-type) person to deal with com-
plaints/appeals of researchers, including those concerning conflicts
between supervisor(s) and early-stage researchers. Such procedures
should provide allresearch staffwith confidentialand informalassistance
in resolving work-related conflicts, disputesand grievances, with the aim
of promoting fair and equitable treatment within the institution and
improving the overallqualityofthe working environment.
Participation in decision-making bodies
Employers and/or funders of researchers should recognise it as wholly
legitimate, and indeed desirable, thatresearchersbe represented in the
relevantinformation, consultation and decision-making bodiesofthe insti-
tutionsfor which theywork, so asto protectand promote their individual
and collective interestsasprofessionalsand to activelycontribute to the
workingsofthe institution 13.
13 In thiscontextsee also EU Directive 2002/14/EC.
22Recruitment
Employers and/or funders should ensure that the entry and admission
standardsfor researchers, particularlyatthe beginning attheir careers, are
clearly specified and should also facilitate access for disadvantaged
groupsor for researchersreturning to a research career, including teachers
(ofanylevel) returning to a research career.
Employersand/or fundersofresearchersshould adhere to the principles
setoutin the Code ofConductfor the RecruitmentofResearcherswhen
appointing or recruiting researchers.
23Section 2
The Code ofConductforthe RecruitmentofResearchers
The code ofconductfor the recruitmentofresearchersconsistsofa setof
generalprinciplesand requirementsthatshould be followed byemployers
and/or funders when appointing or recruiting researchers. These prin-
ciples and requirements should ensure observance of values such as
transparencyofthe recruitmentprocessand equaltreatmentofallappli-
cants, in particular with regard to the developmentofan attractive, open
and sustainable European labour market for researchers, and are com-
plementary to those outlined in the European Charter for Researchers.
Institutionsand employersadhering to the Code ofConductwillopenly
demonstrate their commitment to act in a responsible and respectable
wayand to provide fair frameworkconditionsto researchers, with a clear
intention to contribute to the advancementofthe European Research Area.
General Principles and Requirements for the Code of Conduct
Recruitment
Employersand/or fundersshould establish recruitmentprocedureswhich
are open 14, efficient, transparent, supportive and internationallycompa-
rable, aswellastailored to the type ofpositionsadvertised.
14 Allavailable instrumentsshould be used, in particular internationalor globallyaccessible
web-based resources such as the pan-European Researcher’s Mobility Portal:
http://europa.eu.int/eracareers.
24Advertisementsshould give a broad description ofknowledge and com-
petencies required, and should not be so specialised as to discourage
suitable applicants. Employersshould include a description ofthe working
conditions and entitlements, including career development prospects.
Moreover, the time allowed between the advertisementofthe vacancyor
the callfor applicationsand the deadline for replyshould be realistic.
Selection
Selection committeesshould bring together diverse expertise and compe-
tencesand should have an adequate gender balance and, where appropri-
ate and feasible, include membersfrom differentsectors(publicand private)
and disciplines, including from other countriesand with relevantexperience
to assessthe candidate. Whenever possible, a wide range ofselection prac-
ticesshould be used, such asexternalexpertassessmentand face-to-face
interviews. Membersofselection panelsshould be adequatelytrained.
Transparency
Candidatesshould be informed, prior to the selection, aboutthe recruitment
processand the selection criteria, the number ofavailable positionsand the
career developmentprospects. Theyshould also be informed after the selec-
tion processaboutthe strengthsand weaknessesoftheir applications.
Judging merit
The selection processshould take into consideration the whole range of
experience 15ofthe candidates. While focusing on their overallpotentialas
researchers, their creativity and level of independence should also be
considered.
15 See also The European Charter for Researchers: Evaluation/Appraisalsystemsin Section 1 of
thisdocument.
25Thismeansthatmeritshould be judged qualitativelyaswellasquantita-
tively, focusing on outstanding resultswithin a diversified career path and
notonlyon the number ofpublications. Consequently, the importance of
bibliometricindicesshould be properlybalanced within a wider range of
evaluation criteria, such asteaching, supervision, teamwork, knowledge
transfer, managementofresearch and innovation and publicawareness
activities. For candidatesfrom an industrialbackground, particular attention
should be paid to anycontributionsto patents, developmentor inventions.
Variationsin the chronologicalorder ofCVs
Career breaksor variationsin the chronologicalorder ofCVsshould notbe
penalised, butregarded asan evolution ofa career, and consequently, as
a potentiallyvaluable contribution to the professional development of
researcherstowardsa multidimensionalcareer track. Candidatesshould
therefore be allowed to submit evidence-based CVs, reflecting a repre-
sentative arrayofachievementsand qualificationsappropriate to the post
for which application isbeing made.
Recognition ofmobilityexperience
Anymobilityexperience, e.g. a stayin another country/region or in another
research setting (publicor private) or a change from one discipline or sector
to another, whether aspartofthe initialresearch training or ata later stage
ofthe research career, or virtualmobilityexperience, should be considered
asa valuable contribution to the professionaldevelopmentofa researcher.
Recognition ofqualifications
Employersand/or fundersshould provide for appropriate assessmentand
evaluation ofthe academicand professionalqualifications, including non-
formalqualifications, ofallresearchers, in particular within the contextof
26internationaland professionalmobility. Theyshould inform themselves
and gain a fullunderstanding ofrules, proceduresand standardsgover-
ning the recognition of such qualifications and, consequently, explore
existing nationallaw, conventionsand specificruleson the recognition of
these qualificationsthrough allavailable channels16.
Seniority
The levelsofqualificationsrequired should be in line with the needsofthe
position and notbe setasa barrier to entry. Recognition and evaluation
ofqualificationsshould focuson judging the achievementsofthe person
rather than his/her circumstancesor the reputation ofthe institution where
the qualifications were gained. As professional qualifications may be
gained atan earlystage ofa long career, the pattern oflifelong profes-
sionaldevelopmentshould also be recognised.
Postdoctoralappointments
Clear rulesand explicitguidelinesfor the recruitmentand appointmentof
postdoctoralresearchers, including the maximum duration and the objec-
tives of such appointments, should be established by the institutions
appointing postdoctoral researchers. Such guidelines should take into
accounttime spentin prior postdoctoralappointmentsatother institutions
and take into consideration that the postdoctoral status should be
transitional, with the primarypurpose ofproviding additionalprofessional
development opportunities for a research career in the context of long-
term career prospects.

KI-NA-21620-EN-C The European Commission has adopted the European Charter for
Researchers and a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of
Researchers. These two documents are key elements in the EU’s
policy to make research an attractive career, which is a vital
feature of its strategy to stimulate economic and employment
growth. The Charter and Code of Conduct will give individual
researchers the same rights and obligations wherever they may
work throughout the EU. This should help counter the fact that
research careers in Europe are fragmented at local, regional,
national or sectoral level, and allow Europe to make the most of
its scientific potential.Annex to GB decision no. CleanHydrogen-GB-2022-02

10Executive summary
This document represents the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA2) 2021-2027
of the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (hereafter also Clean Hydrogen JU3). It covers
therefore the duration of Horizon Europe and identifies the key priorities and the essential
technologies and innovations required to achieve the objectives of the joint undertaking4.
The Clean Hydrogen JU is the continuation of the successful Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint
Undertakings (FCH JU and FCH 2 JU), under FP7 and Horizon 2020 (H2020) respectively. It
is set up in the form of an institutionalised partnership under the Research and Innovation
Framework Programme Horizon Europe.
The EU remains committed to the 2030 Agenda, by setting and implementing an ambitious
policy programme to deliver on sustainability in the EU and beyond. As part of its policy agenda,
on 11 December 2019 the European Commission presented the European Green Deal, a new
growth strategy for Europe aiming to transform the Union into a modern, resource-efficient and
competitive economy. The implementation of the Green Deal would set the EU on a course to
become a sustainable climate-neutral and circular economy by 2050. To achieve these
ambitious goals, the European Commission adopted the Fit-for-55 package with a set of policy
proposals approaching the goal of emission reductions from many different angles, with both
targeted and horizontal policy measures. In this set of proposals the role of clean energy
technologies and carriers is prominent, becoming in essence the enablers for achieving EU’s
ambitious goals.
In this context and due to its multiple possible uses, hydrogen is expected to play a key role in
a future climate-neutral economy, enabling emission-free transport, heating and industrial
processes as well as inter-seasonal energy storage. To emphasise its importance and facilitate
the scaling up of hydrogen applications, the Commission adopted in 2020 the EU hydrogen
strategy, aiming to accelerate the development of clean hydrogen. To achieve this, it will require
among others the improvement of its competitiveness against other energy carriers, research
and innovation into breakthrough technologies and an infrastructure network that can bring it
to a geographically spread market.
Focusing on research and innovation rather than deployment, the Council and the Parliament
adopted the Single Basic Act, a regulation establishing the Joint Undertakings under Horizon
Europe, including the establishment of the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking. The Clean
Hydrogen JU will have the leading role in research activities related to hydrogen, collaborating
closely with most of the end-use European partnerships on hydrogen applications in the
relevant sectors.
The Clean Hydrogen JU will contribute to the European climate neutrality goal by producing
noticeable, quantifiable results towards the development and scaling up of hydrogen
applications. This will help develop a number of hydrogen technologies, which are currently
either not competitive or have a low technology readiness level, but are expected to contribute
to the 2030 energy and climate targets and most importantly make possible climate neutrality
by 2050.
2 Previously known as Multi-Annual Work Plan (MAWP) for FCH 2 JU.
3 For purposes of communication with the public, the name Clean Hydrogen Partnership is also used
instead of the legal name of the JU. In the present document only the legal name is used.
4 According to the Article 2-Definitions of the SBA
11The scope of the research and innovation activities of the Clean Hydrogen JU will have a
different scope compared to FCH 2 JU, shifting to areas related primarily to the production of
clean hydrogen, as well as the distribution, storage and end use applications of low carbon
hydrogen in hard to abate sectors. They will be guided to a large extent by EU’s Hydrogen
Strategy and the policy developments in this context, contributing to its implementation.
Planned research and innovation actions
The key component in the implementation of the Programme is the annual Call for Proposals,
covering a number of the research and innovation actions described in the SRIA. They
represent a set of prioritised actions, consistent with the objectives of the Clean Hydrogen JU,
divided into the Pillars presented in Section 3.1.
The emphasis given to different actions in different pillars reflects the industry and research
partners’ assessment of the state of the technological maturity of the applications and their
estimated importance to achieve critical objectives of the Clean Hydrogen JU.
Below the main scientific priorities and challenges for the different pillars and activities:
Hydrogen production
Further improvements are required especially in cost reduction and efficiency increase for a
variety of renewable hydrogen production routes, the main workhorse being electrolysis,
supported by other routes exploiting direct sunlight such as thermal dissociation of water using
concentrated solar energy or through photocatalysis, biomass/biogas or other biological routes.
Water electrolysis will be the main technology supported, covering both high TRL types -
Alkaline Electrolysis (AEL), Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis (PEMEL), Solid Oxide
Electrolysis (SOEL) - and less mature types - Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolysis (AEMEL)
and Proton Conducting Ceramic Electrolysis (PCCEL).
Hydrogen storage and distribution
As explicitly mentioned in the EU Hydrogen Strategy, it is essential that hydrogen becomes an
intrinsic part of an integrated energy system. For this to happen, hydrogen will have to be used
for daily and/or seasonal storage providing buffering functions, thereby enhancing security of
supply in the medium term. The strategy also calls for an EU-wide logistical infrastructure that
needs to be developed to transport hydrogen from areas with large renewable potential to
demand centres across Europe.
A pluralistic approach with respect to the technologies that will be investigated and supported
is envisaged, to have a complete set of technologies that can serve as building blocks of the
EU-wide logistical infrastructure.
Hydrogen end uses - transport
The technology developments so far are not sufficient to meet the ambitious emission
reductions in transport. A number of technology routes still need further improvements,
especially in the context of reducing costs and increasing durability, in order to make them
competitive with incumbent technologies.
It should be also stressed that, especially in the case of hydrogen-based transportation, the
competitiveness of hydrogen technologies is dependent on research and innovation
breakthroughs, on production volumes of vehicles and components and on the price and
availability of hydrogen as a fuel. Therefore, actions aimed at stimulating a broad rollout of FC
12vehicles around Europe are equally important to research and innovation actions, in particular
for hard to abate sectors, in order to drive the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the FC vehicles
down.
Hydrogen end uses - clean heat and power
Hydrogen offers a unique chance to decarbonise the power generation and heating sectors
reliably and independently from weather or seasonal conditions. The overall goal of this pillar
is to support European supply chain actors to develop a portfolio of solutions providing clean,
renewable and flexible heat and power generation for all end users’ needs and across all
system sizes; from domestic systems all the way to large-scale power generation plants.
Preferential support will be for solutions running on 100% hydrogen. However, there is still room
to support solutions running on a hydrogen mixture in the gas grid (up to 20% within the context
of the activities included in this support area) during the transition phase5.
Cross-Cutting activities
Mass-market commercialisation of hydrogen-based technologies presents a number of
systemic (or horizontal) challenges that need to be addressed to effectively kick-start a
hydrogen ecosystem of significant scale throughout the EU in the coming decade.
Cross-cutting activities are structured around three focus areas: (i) Sustainability; (ii) Education
and public awareness; and (iii) Safety, pre-normative research and regulations, codes and
standards.
Hydrogen Valleys
Since 2014, FCH JU has pursued the concept of hydrogen territories, which have evolved into
the most recent concept of Hydrogen Valleys. A Hydrogen Valley is a defined geographical
area, city, region or industrial area where several hydrogen applications are combined together
and integrated within an FCH ecosystem. The idea is to demonstrate how all the different parts
of the use of hydrogen as an energy vector fit together in an integrated system approach. This
concept has gained momentum and is now one of the main priorities of industry and the
European Commission (EC) for scaling-up hydrogen deployments and creating interconnected
hydrogen ecosystems across Europe.
Hydrogen Supply Chains
Hydrogen technologies and systems have been recently identified by the European
Commission as an emerging and strategic value chain for Europe.6 A set of actions are
foreseen aiming at strengthening the overall supply chain of hydrogen technologies, from
processing the raw materials into specialised materials (e.g. electro-catalysts), production of
components and sub-system to system integration. The supply chain is complemented by the
wider view of the value chain approach vis-à-vis creation of jobs, added value to economy and
industry competitiveness.
Strategic Research Challenges
To ensure a continuous generation of early stage research knowledge, the above actions will
be supplemented by multidisciplinary investigations, gathering expertise at different technology

13scale (materials, component, cell, stack and system). All the generated knowledge needs also
to be combined in such a way to allow further comprehensive interpretations. The proposed
approach considers gathering, with a long-term vision and covering the whole Clean Hydrogen
JU activities, the needed capabilities and expertise from European Research and Technology
Organisations (RTO).
Other activities
Although the financial support to research and innovation actions is the main tool of the JU to
achieve its objectives, it is not sufficient. A number of additional activities are necessary to fulfil
its objectives, as follows:
Activities related to Synergies
In line with the SBA, the JU will develop close cooperation and ensure coordination with other
European partnerships, including by dedicating, where appropriate, a part of the joint
undertaking’s budget to joint calls. Moreover, it will seek and maximise synergies with and,
where appropriate, possibilities for further funding from relevant activities and programmes at
Union, national and regional level.
Activities related to Regulations, Codes and Standards
The Clean Hydrogen JU will contribute to supporting the implementation of hydrogen-specific
regulatory and enabling frameworks by a strategic and coordinated approach to RCS issues
within the Programme, which will mostly be implemented through Pre-Normative Research
(PNR) activities. Moreover, a RCS Strategy Coordination (RCS SC) Task Force will be set up
to better coordinate these activities.
Activities related to European Hydrogen Safety
Independently of the research and innovation actions addressing hydrogen safety issues, the
Clean Hydrogen JU will retain and further reinforce the European Hydrogen Safety Panel
(EHSP), aiming to support the development and deployment of inherently safer hydrogen
systems and infrastructure.
Activities related to Sustainability and Circularity
The Clean Hydrogen JU will set up a European Hydrogen Sustainability and Circularity Panel
(EHS&CP) at the Programme level which will act as a focal point or “advisor” to the Programme
in these matters in an independent, coordinated and consolidated way.
Activities related to knowledge management
The main goals of the Clean Hydrogen JU knowledge activities will be to support the collection
and diffusion of high quality new knowledge and support evidence-based implementation of
Union policies, while monitoring progress towards the achievement of the objectives of the
Clean Hydrogen JU.
Activities related to SMEs
The Clean Hydrogen JU will continue to rely on the innovativeness of SMEs. To do this, it will
need to deal with two of the largest obstacles that SMEs must overcome, the need to raise
financing, especially in the early stages of growth, and to kick-start sales and thereby gain
valuable field experience.
14Activities related to international cooperation
The Clean Hydrogen JU will build on the actions undertaken by its predecessor and expand
them accordingly, in order to support the European Commission under its coordination in the
implementation of its international cooperation agenda in research and innovation.
Activities related to Communication
The JU will undertake a number of communication activities with the objective to promote the
development of the hydrogen technologies sector, build public awareness and acceptance of
the hydrogen technologies and ensure communication towards and between stakeholders.
Such communication activities will be coordinated with the European Commission.
Programme Implementation and Governance
The budget of the Clean Hydrogen JU shall be formed of contributions from the Union and its
members other than the Union – namely Hydrogen Europe and Hydrogen Europe Research.
The financial contribution from the Union to cover administrative and operational costs of the
Clean Hydrogen JU shall be 1 billion euro, with the private members contributing at least the
same amount. In order to achieve its objectives, the Clean Hydrogen JU shall provide financial
support mainly in the form of grants for research and innovation activities to participants,
following open and competitive Calls for proposals.
In order to manage and implement its budget, the JU will retain a similar structure to the one of
the FCH 2 JU. The Governing Board will be the decision-making body of the JU that decides
on the long-term strategic orientation of the partnership, as well as its annual priorities. The
Executive Director shall be the chief executive responsible for the day-to-day management of
the joint undertaking in accordance with the decisions of the GB and, operating under his
responsibility, the Programme Office will execute all the necessary tasks for the implementation
of the mandate of the Clean Hydrogen JU. The Member States and associated countries will
be represented through the States Representative Group, while the public and private
stakeholders active in the field of hydrogen will also be able to provide input on the strategic
priorities of the JU via the Stakeholders Group.
The Clean Hydrogen JU prepared a Strategy Map7 in order to better map its objectives coming
from the Single Basic Act and the Horizon Europe Regulation and assist in preparing its
programme implementation strategy. The Strategy Map links the resources of the JU and the
actions taken (operational objectives / indicators) towards concrete outcomes (specific
objectives / indicators) and directly to one (or more) of the general objectives and intended
impacts of the Clean Hydrogen JU, which would contribute in turn to one or more high-level
objectives of the Union.
To facilitate the tracking of progress towards the objectives, the Clean Hydrogen JU has set up
a monitoring framework that will allow it to continuously monitor its management activities and
perform periodic reviews of the outputs, results and impacts of its projects, implemented in
accordance with the Horizon Europe Regulation.
The successful implementation of all the above require a modern and effective administration.
For this reason, Clean Hydrogen JU aims for an effective management of human resources in
order to optimise the capacity to deliver on the Clean Hydrogen JU’s objectives and core
business. The Clean Hydrogen JU relies on a performance culture in which staff is motivated
7 See Figure 3 Strategy Map of the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, Section 7.
15and can deliver work of a consistently high quality, adding value. The Clean Hydrogen JU will
ensure its organisational structure and staff allocation is adapted to its needs and priorities,
allocating staff efficiently taking into account the talent and potential of staff and workload
issues.
The above will be complemented by sound financial management and cost-effective controls,
which give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of underlying
transactions. In line with the Commission’s Digital Strategy, the JU continue its transition to the
new digital era, on the basis of paperless procedures, improved access and use of data and IT
systems permitting the efficient collaboration of staff independent of their location. Finally, the
Clean Hydrogen JU will strive to improve its environmental impact in all its actions and will
actively promote measures to reduce the related day-to-day impact of the administration and
its work.
161. Introduction
This document represents the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA8) 2021-2027
of the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (hereon also Clean Hydrogen JU9). The overall goal
of the Clean Hydrogen JU is to support research and innovation (R&I) activities in the Union in
clean hydrogen solutions and technologies, under EU’s new funding programme for research
and innovation, Horizon Europe, established by the Horizon Europe Regulation10, and in
synergy with other EU initiatives and programmes. The Clean Hydrogen JU is the continuation
of the successful Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertakings (FCH JU and FCH 2 JU), under
FP7 and Horizon 2020 (H2020) respectively.
The European Green Deal and the climate neutrality ambition of Europe
As part of the sustainable development agenda, the "2030 Agenda"11 as summarised in the 17
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)12, all countries are committed to develop strategies to
address the global challenge for sustainable development. The aim is to support economic
growth, while addressing in parallel a range of social needs and tackling climate change and
environmental sustainability.
The EU remains committed to the 2030 Agenda, by setting and implementing an ambitious
policy programme to deliver on sustainability in the EU and beyond. As part of its policy agenda,
on 11 December 2019 the European Commission (also Commission or EC in the text)
presented the European Green Deal13, a new growth strategy for Europe aiming to transform
the Union into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The implementation of
the Green Deal would set the EU on a course to become a sustainable climate-neutral and
circular economy by 2050.
At the core of the European Green Deal lies the need to fight climate change. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that in order to be on a pathway
to limit temperature increase to 1.5 °C by the end of the century, net-zero CO emissions at
2
global level need to be achieved around 2050 and neutrality for all other greenhouse gases
somewhat later in the century. This would require the EU to become climate neutral by 2050.14
Both the European Parliament and the European Council (also referred to as Parliament and
Council, respectively) have endorsed the long-term EU climate-neutrality objective.15, 16 On 4
March 2020, a European Climate Law was proposed by the Commission, capturing the climate-
neutrality objective in EU law. At the same time, it underlined the need to review the Union’s
targets for 2030 and define a trajectory compatible with the climate neutrality objective by 2050.
To this end, the Commission adopted on September 2020 the 2030 Climate Target Plan,17
proposing the increase of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction ambition for 2030, from
8 Previously known as Multi-Annual Work Plan (MAWP) for FCH 2 JU.

1740% to at least 55%, setting Europe on a cost-effective path for climate neutrality by 2050.
On 28 June 2021 the ambitious Commission proposals were adopted at EU level, writing into
law the goals set out in the European Green Deal. The first European Climate Law18 not only
sets the goal of climate-neutrality and the aspirational goal for EU to strive to achieve negative
emissions after 2050, but also includes a binding EU climate target of a reduction of net
greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) of at least 55% by 2030
compared to 1990.
To achieve these ambitious goals, the European Commission adopted on 14 July 2021 the ‘Fit
for 55’ package19 of policy proposals to make the EU's climate, energy, land use, transport and
taxation policies fit for this target. It is a broad package, containing 13 different proposals
approaching the goal of emission reductions from many different angles, with both targeted and
horizontal policy measures:
• Increasing renewable energy, energy efficiency and member states’ non-ETS targets;
• Strengthening the EU emission trading system (EU ETS), including creating a new ETS
for buildings and road transport (ETS-2);
• Restructuring energy taxation in Europe, including the introduction of a carbon border
adjustment mechanism;
• Revising the CO2 emission standards for new cars;
• Accelerating the development of alternative fuel infrastructure, while at the same time
promoting the use of sustainable fuels in Aviation and Maritime;
• Creating a social climate fund and acknowledging the importance of forests and land
use in achieving our climate goals.
In this set of proposals the role of clean energy technologies and carriers is prominent,
becoming in essence the enablers for achieving EU’s ambitious goals.
The Fit-for-55 package was complemented by a second package in December, the gas markets
and hydrogen package.20 The package consists of the Regulation and the Directive on common
rules on the internal markets for renewable and natural gases and in hydrogen. The main scope
of this massive redrafting is to enable the creation of a European hydrogen market, which would
be fully regulated, as is the case for the current gas and electricity markets, from 2030 onwards.
The role of hydrogen technologies
Fighting climate change will require a deep energy transition. The energy sector – comprising
the use of energy for power generation, transportation, heating and manufacturing – is
responsible for more than 70% of the global GHG emissions. Achieving climate neutrality would
require us to substantially restrict the use of fossil fuels in the energy sector, replacing them
with renewable energy sources and other climate neutral or low carbon fuels, as much as
possible.
As a direct consequence, the share of EU renewable electricity production and other

amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’).

18decarbonised energy carriers are set to gradually replace all current fossil uses. Such an
accomplishment would largely decarbonise electricity from the grid in 2030 and turn it climate
neutral by 2050. This would also present a significant opportunity to make the demand sectors
of our economy climate neutral (buildings, transport, and industry).
Nevertheless, energy transformation comes together with a number of challenges that need to
be addressed. The significant deployment of renewable energy sources in the power sector will
require also the deployment of energy storage and smart grid solutions capable to address its
variable generation profile. At the same time, although electrification based on today’s
technology perspectives seems to be seen an increasingly cost-efficient solution for some
sectors, this does not hold true for all.
Across different examined alternatives complementing electrification, almost all recent
economic analyses indicate that hydrogen is an energy carrier that can play a critical role in
filling the gap and addressing these challenges. Hydrogen can be used as a feedstock, a fuel,
an energy carrier and an energy storage medium, and thus has many possible applications
across industry, transport, power and buildings sectors. Most importantly, when produced
sustainably, it does not emit CO and does not pollute the air when used. It is therefore an
2
important part of the overall solution to meet the 2050 climate neutrality goal of the European
Green Deal.
Complementing other storage applications, including hydro pumps and batteries, as well as
smart grid applications, it can act as a vector for seasonal storage of renewable energy. At the
same time, low-carbon hydrogen can be used to replace fossil fuels in hard to abate sectors
and complement renewable energy sources in the effort to transform our economy.
Furthermore, there is also considerable potential to repurpose the current gas infrastructure to
carry and store this hydrogen, helping achieve EU’s climate goals much faster and more
economically using existing infrastructure.
In its strategic vision for a climate-neutral EU presented by the European Commission on 28
November 2018, the share of hydrogen in Europe’s energy mix is projected to grow from the
current less than 2% to 13-14% by 2050. The projections were confirmed in the recent impact
assessment for the 2030 Climate Target Plan21, as well as the impact assessments supporting
the various policy proposals of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, where the policy scenarios considered
project a ramp up of the installed electrolyser capacity between 37-66 GW by 2035, while for
2050 all policy scenarios project the share for hydrogen in final energy consumption to be at
least 9% across policy scenarios. The Fit-For-55 package also considers a 50% target (by
2030) for RFNBOs (which include renewable hydrogen) in industry and a target of at least 2.6%
in transport. Blending hydrogen with natural gas in the pipelines is facilitated in the gas and
hydrogen markets package, by allowing blends of up to 5% hydrogen volume into natural gas
flows to be accepted and facilitated at cross-border points from October 2025, while voluntary
agreements for higher blends at interconnection points between Member States remain
possible.22
In order for hydrogen to claim this position in the energy mix, it will require among others the
improvement of its competitiveness against other energy carriers, research and innovation into
breakthrough technologies and an infrastructure network that can bring it to a geographically

The EU hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe
On 8 July 2020, the Commission adopted the Energy System Integration23 and Hydrogen
Strategies24. Together they aim to address a vision on how to accelerate the transition towards
a more integrated and clean energy system, in support of a climate neutral economy.
The Energy System Integration Strategy addresses the planning and operation of the energy
system “as a whole”, across multiple energy carriers, infrastructures, and consumption sectors.
The Strategy sets out 38 actions to implement the necessary reforms, including legal, financial
and research and development actions. The strategy is built on three complementary and
mutually reinforcing elements:
1. A more circular energy system.
2. The use of cleaner electricity produced from renewable sources.
3. The promotion of renewable and low-carbon fuels, including hydrogen, for sectors that
are hard to decarbonise.
Recognising the complexity of the hydrogen value chain and the need to act on different areas
in order to promote low-carbon hydrogen, the Commission also adopted a Hydrogen Strategy,
complementing the Energy System Integration Strategy. Its aim is to identify means to unlock
the potential of renewable hydrogen, by decarbonising hydrogen production and expanding the
use of low-carbon hydrogen in hard to decarbonise sectors, where it can replace fossil fuels.
Building on the Commission’s New Industrial Strategy for Europe25 and the Recovery Plan for
Europe26, the Strategy sets out a vision of how the EU can turn hydrogen into a viable solution
to decarbonise different sectors over time. Most notably, it sets the ambitious goal of installing
at least 6 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolysers in the EU by 2024 to produce 1 million tons
of hydrogen and 40 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolysers by 2030 to produce 10 million
tons of hydrogen.
Through the Hydrogen Strategy a first attempt to define the different types of hydrogen is made,
based on their means of production. This document uses to the largest extent the terminology
proposed in the Hydrogen Strategy27:
- Renewable hydrogen refers to either electricity-based hydrogen produced through the
electrolysis of water and with the electricity stemming from renewable sources or
through the reforming of biogas or biochemical conversion of biomass.
- Clean hydrogen refers to renewable hydrogen.

25 New Industrial Strategy for Europe. COM (2020) 102 final.
26 Europe's moment: Repair and Prepare for the Next Generation. COM (2020) 456 final.
27 According to the Energy System Integration Strategy, the Commission was planning to propose a
comprehensive terminology for all renewable and low-carbon fuels and a European system of
certification of such fuels by June 2021. Such a proposal has been included in the revision of the
Renewable Energy Directive in the context of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, but only for renewable hydrogen.
As stated in the impact assessment of the proposal, a political decision is required for the inclusion or
not of the certification of low-carbon fuels in the same or different proposal, such as the Hydrogen and
Decarbonised Gas Market Package planned for the fourth quarter of 2021. For this reason it was
decided to remain with the Hydrogen Strategy terminology.
20- Electricity-based hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced through electrolysis, regardless
of the electricity source.
- Fossil-based hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced through a variety of processes
using fossil fuels as feedstock, mainly the reforming of natural gas or the gasification of
coal.
- Fossil-based hydrogen with carbon capture is a subpart of fossil-based hydrogen, but
where greenhouse gases emitted as part of the hydrogen production process are
captured.
- Low-carbon hydrogen28 encompasses fossil-based hydrogen with carbon capture and
low-carbon electricity-based hydrogen.
The Hydrogen Strategy identifies as the priority for the EU to develop renewable hydrogen,
produced using mainly wind, hydro and solar energy. This should be the main form of hydrogen
in the long-term, towards 2050, supported by the very high shares of renewable electricity. In
the mid-term, other forms of low-carbon hydrogen will also be needed, both to support the
uptake of hydrogen as energy carrier and feedstock, and to replace most polluting forms of
producing hydrogen.
The Hydrogen Strategy describes a roadmap with three phases of development:
1st phase: 2020-2024 (activation)
• Install at least 6 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolysers to decarbonise existing
hydrogen production, producing 1 Mt of renewable hydrogen in the EU;
• Scaling up of manufacturing of electrolysers;
• Planning of transmission and carbon capture infrastructure;
• Setting up the regulatory and enabling framework for a hydrogen market.
2nd phase: 2025-2030 (upscaling)
• Install at least 40 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolysers, producing 10 Mt of
renewable hydrogen in the EU;
• Increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable hydrogen;
• New application for hydrogen, including steel making, trucks, rail and maritime transport
applications.
• Electricity-based hydrogen offering flexibility services to the power system;
• Retrofitting of existing fossil-fuel production with carbon capture;
• Emergence of EU-wide logistical and transportation infrastructure for hydrogen;
• Development of Hydrogen Valleys;
• Financial support to stimulate investments;
• Completion of an open and competitive EU hydrogen market.
28 In the Gas and Hydrogen Market package, a newer definition is provided for low-carbon hydrogen.
According to it, it refers to “hydrogen the energy content of which is derived from non-renewable
sources, which meets a greenhouse gas emission reduction threshold of 70%”.
213rd phase: 2031-2050 (market uptake)
• Low carbon hydrogen technologies reaching maturity, able to be deployed at large scale
to reach all hard to decarbonise sectors.
Achieving the above targets will require significant research and innovation efforts, in particular
for the second and third phases of the roadmap.
On the generation side, there is a need to optimise and develop specific renewable assets for
the renewable hydrogen production and to upscale electrolysers in order to increase
competitiveness compared to fossil-based hydrogen, but also develop solutions which are
currently at a lower technology readiness level. On the distribution side, further developments
are needed in relation to the distribution, storage and dispensing of hydrogen in large volumes
and possibly over long distances. Finally, on the demand side, large scale end-use applications
need to be further developed, notably in industry and in heavy transport.
Pre-normative research, including the safety dimension, should be tailored to assist deployment
plans and enable improved, harmonised standards. Reliable methodologies have to be
developed for assessing the environmental impacts of hydrogen technologies and their
associated value chains, including their full life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and
sustainability. Coordinated EU research and innovation support is also needed for large-scale
high-impact projects across the entire hydrogen value chain.
The Commission aims to address these challenges through its coordinated research and
innovation support.
On 11 December 2020, the Council adopted conclusions on steps to be taken towards creating
a hydrogen market for Europe.29 The conclusions gave political guidance to the implementation
of the EU Hydrogen Strategy presented by the European Commission on 8 July 2020. In its
conclusions, the Council recognised the important role of hydrogen, especially from renewable
sources, and the need for the hydrogen market to be significantly scaled up, asking the
Commission to further elaborate and implement the EU Hydrogen Strategy. The pathway
towards the roadmap’s objectives should use joint programmes, be cost-efficient and prioritise
energy efficiency and electrification from renewable sources. The Council also sees the need
to develop an ambitious hydrogen roadmap and strategy for climate neutrality in the end-use
sectors, which makes use of flexible policies.
On 19 May 2021, the European Parliament also adopted a resolution30 on the European
Strategy for Hydrogen. The Member of the Parliament requested for incentives to encourage
demand and to create a European hydrogen market and fast deployment of hydrogen
infrastructure. They also emphasised the need to phase out fossil-based hydrogen as soon as
possible, while certification should be applied to all hydrogen imports, similar to EU-produced
hydrogen. Finally, they requested to assess the possibility of repurposing existing gas pipelines
for the transport and underground storage of hydrogen.
As the first step in the implementation of the EU Hydrogen Strategy, the ‘Fit for 55’ package
contains a number of measures aiming to promote the production and use of hydrogen and
hydrogen based fuels in the different sectors of the economy. The revised Renewable Energy

(2020/2242(INI))
22Directive31 proposes the extension of the EU-wide certification system for renewable fuels to
include hydrogen, as well as targets for transport and industry that include renewable hydrogen
consumption. Additional financial incentives for hydrogen are foreseen by the revision of the
EU ETS proposal,32 which shall extend to maritime, establish emissions trading for transport
and buildings; and include electrolytic hydrogen under ETS, thus making low carbon hydrogen
eligible for free allowances. Further incentives shall be given through the preferential taxes for
the use of low carbon hydrogen, foreseen in the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive.33
Hydrogen is promoted specifically in the transport sector by three additional targeted proposals:
the more stringent CO standards for Cars and Vans;34 the revision of the Alternative Fuel
2
Infrastructure Regulation35, requiring one hydrogen refuelling station available every 150 km
along the TEN-T core network and in every urban nodes by 2030; and the FuelEU Maritime
proposal36 promoting strongly low carbon hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels (including
methanol and ammonia).
The proposals in the new Gas Markets Decarbonisation package address a number of issues
associated with gas markets and networks, most notably ensuring that the necessary hydrogen
infrastructure and contestable hydrogen markets are in place to serve the expected rising
supply and demand. References to hydrogen have been introduced all over the gas Regulation
and Directive, so that provisions for gas markets apply also for the hydrogen market (including
the introduction of hydrogen network operators, hydrogen terminals and hydrogen storage
facilities). Barriers for blended hydrogen are removed, in order to boost hydrogen’s role in the
gas market.
The Commission also places a focus on network planning, including a push for gas network
operators to include information on infrastructure that can or will be decommissioned and could
potentially be repurposed to transport hydrogen. Finally, a certification scheme will be
introduced to confirm whether the gas brought on the market is renewable or low-carbon. The
European Commission has now added a definition for low carbon gases and fuels under the
same certification scheme as renewable gases.
The R&I support of hydrogen activities of the European Union
The EU has been supporting research and innovation on hydrogen for many years, starting
through traditional collaborative projects, and subsequently mainly with the FCH JU established
in 2008.
The early EU Framework Programmes (FP) supported research and development in fuel cells
and hydrogen technologies with increasing funding levels over time. Nevertheless, these efforts
were fragmented and uncoordinated across the different FP sub-programmes. Recognising this
issue, the European Commission facilitated the creation of a European Hydrogen and Fuel Cell

23Technology platform (HFP) (2004-2007), bringing together all interested stakeholders. This
process confirmed that a coherent, long-term approach at EU level is essential for achieving
critical mass in terms of scale, excellence and potential for innovation.
In May 2008, the Council adopted a Regulation37 setting up a Joint Undertaking for Fuel Cells
and Hydrogen. The aim of FCH JU under FP7 was to accelerate the development and
deployment of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies by executing an integrated European
programme of Research Technology and Development activities for the period 2007-2013.
The programme entered its second phase, with FCH 2 JU, in Horizon 2020. FCH 2 JU was a
public-private partnership with three members: the industry grouping Hydrogen Europe, the
research grouping Hydrogen Europe Research and the European Commission. The focus was
on accelerating the commercialisation of fuel cells and hydrogen technologies to ensure a world
leading, competitive European FCH industry while increasing jobs.
These efforts have enabled several technologies to come close to maturity, alongside the
development of high-profile projects in promising applications, and to achieve EU global
leadership for future technologies, notably on electrolysers, hydrogen refuelling stations and
megawatt-scale fuel cells. EU funded projects also allowed improvement in the understanding
of the applicable regulation for boosting the production and utilisation of hydrogen in the EU.
Nevertheless, these developments are far from sufficient to meet the increased ambition
reflected in the Hydrogen Strategy. Therefore, the Commission plans to carry out a set of
actions targeting research, innovation, and relevant international cooperation, supporting the
energy and climate policy objectives.
On one hand, it can provide financial support through the EU ETS Innovation Fund, to facilitate
first-of-a-kind demonstration of innovative hydrogen-based technologies, and through targeted
support to build the necessary capacity for preparation of financially sound and viable hydrogen
projects.
On the other hand, and focusing more on research and innovation rather than deployment, the
Council and the Parliament adopted a regulation establishing the Joint Undertakings under
Horizon Europe (hereon Single Basic Act or SBA),38 including the establishment of the Clean
Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, the continuation of FCH 2 JU. The Clean Hydrogen JU will have
the leading role in research activities related to hydrogen. Since hydrogen can be deployed as
a fuel, energy carrier and for storing energy it is essential that the clean hydrogen partnership
establishes structured collaboration with many other European partnerships, notably for end-
use. However, hydrogen related research will also be supported by other partnerships and EU
Funds under direct supervision of the European Commission, as well as collaborative research
and innovation actions of Horizon Europe and other EU programmes. Moreover, low technology
readiness levels for hydrogen may also be supported through calls for applications of the
European Research Council. Finally, intergovernmental coordination of EU Member States and
other States under the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) agenda, has led to emergence of
a proposal for Mission Innovation 2.0 on hydrogen, where the European Commission is
expected to co-lead with Australia, Chile, Germany and the United Kingdom a mission on
hydrogen. Mission Innovation 2.0 will also aim at intergovernmental initiatives on research and

24innovation. To this end, a framework of co-operation aiming to benefit from the synergies across
the different programmes has been set up, described in more detail in Section 4.1.
The Clean Hydrogen JU is set up in the form of an institutionalised partnership under the
Research and Innovation Framework Programme Horizon Europe. Its main focus will be on
renewable hydrogen production, as well as hydrogen transmission, distribution and storage,
alongside selected fuel cell end-use technologies.
2. Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking
Mission and vision of the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking
Clean Hydrogen JU Vision
Support a sustainable hydrogen economy,
contributing to EU’s climate goals
Clean Hydrogen JU Mission
Facilitate the transition to a greener EU society
through the development of hydrogen technologies.
The Clean Hydrogen JU will contribute to the European climate neutrality goal by producing
noticeable, quantifiable results towards the development and scaling up of hydrogen
applications. This will help develop a number of hydrogen technologies, which are currently
either not competitive or have a low technology readiness level, but are expected to contribute
to the 2030 energy and climate targets and most importantly make possible climate neutrality
by 2050.
The focus of the research and innovation activities of the Clean Hydrogen JU will have a
different scope compared to FCH 2 JU, shifting to areas related primarily to the production of
clean hydrogen, as well as the distribution, storage and end use applications of low carbon
hydrogen in hard to abate sectors. They will be guided to a large extent by EU’s Hydrogen
Strategy and the policy developments in this context, contributing to its implementation.
In particular the Clean Hydrogen JU will aim to accelerate the development and deployment of
the European value chain for safe and sustainable clean hydrogen technologies, strengthening
its competitiveness and with a view to supporting notably SMEs, accelerating the market entry
of innovative competitive clean solutions. The final goal is to contribute to a sustainable,
decarbonised and fully integrated EU energy system, and to the EU’s Hydrogen Strategy,
playing an important role in the implementation of its roadmap towards a climate neutrality and
circular European Society.
To this end, cross-cutting aspects such as safety, circularity and sustainability may be
embedded throughout the entire Clean Hydrogen JU Programme, guiding and underpinning
the activities undertaken within. Concerning circularity and sustainability aspects, in particular,
it is foreseen that activities should not only address these aspects as part of the “post-
development” assessment, but also for orientating and/or looking for solutions and/or taking
decisions (e.g. materials selection) to develop a product, technology and/or a value chain in a
more sustainable and circular manner. In this sense, “Safety and circularity by design” should
25become essential aspects across the Clean Hydrogen JU Programme.
Objectives of the Clean Hydrogen JU for 2021-2027
The Clean Hydrogen JU objectives are defined in articles 4, 5 and 73 of the Single Basic Act38.
Articles 4 and 5 describe the general, specific and operational objectives common to all
partnerships. These objectives were identified in a coordinated impact assessment for all
partnerships, aiming to align them with the objectives of Horizon Europe and EU policy in
general. Article 73 adds additional general and specific objectives to the Clean Hydrogen JU,
more specific to its role and scope.
Overall, the objectives of the Clean Hydrogen JU significantly increase, compared to the ones
of FCH 2 JU. In particular, the three general objectives of FCH 2 JU become seven in total, four
of which are specific to the Clean Hydrogen JU. Similarly, the specific objectives from five in
FCH 2 JU become nine in total, four of which are specific to the Clean Hydrogen JU. To these
nine, more operational objectives are added, common to all partnerships. In total, the Single
Basic Act identifies twenty-nine objectives for the Clean Hydrogen JU, eleven of which specific
to the Clean Hydrogen JU.
The common objectives for all partnerships ensure clear impact for the EU and its people,
achieving strategic objectives such as accelerating the transition towards sustainable
development goals and a green and digital Europe, while contributing to recovery from the
COVID-related crisis. They aim to strengthen and integrate the Union’s scientific and
technological capacities to support the creation and diffusion of new high-quality knowledge
notably with a view to deliver on global challenges, securing Union competitiveness,
sustainability and contributing to a reinforced European Research Area.
The objectives specific to the Clean Hydrogen JU reflect the need to strengthen and integrate
Union scientific capacity in order to accelerate the development and improvement of advanced
clean hydrogen applications ready for market, across energy, transport, building and industrial
end-uses. In order for that acceleration to become possible, it needs to be combined with
actions strengthening competitiveness of the Union clean hydrogen value chain, and notably
SMEs. Particular attention is given to the co-operation with other European partnerships under
Horizon Europe.39 For that purpose, a specific structure – the Stakeholder Representative
Group (see Section 6.5) – will be reporting to the Governing Board. The Clean Hydrogen JU
would be the only partnership focused on addressing hydrogen production technologies.
Collaboration with end-use partnerships should in particular focus on integration and
demonstration.
In this context, the Single Basic Act defines the following general objectives specific for the
Clean Hydrogen JU, while following the principle of technological neutrality:
a) Contribute to the objectives set out in the 2030 Climate Target Plan and the European
Green Deal and the European climate law, by raising the Union’s ambition on reducing
greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55 % below 1990 levels by 2030, and climate
neutrality at the latest by 2050;
b) Contribute to the implementation of the 2020 European Commission’s Hydrogen
39 See also recital 58 of the SBA, where it is explicitly mentioned that “The clean hydrogen European
partnership should interact in particular with the zero emission road and waterborne transport, Europe’s
railway, clean aviation, processes for the planet and clean steel European partnerships.”.
26Strategy for a climate neutral Europe40;
c) Strengthen the competitiveness of the Union clean hydrogen value chain, with a view
to supporting, notably SMEs, accelerating the market entry of innovative competitive
clean solutions;
d) Stimulate research and innovation on clean hydrogen production, distribution, storage
and end use applications.
These are then translated in the following specific objectives:
1. Improve through research and innovation, including activities related to lower
Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, reliability,
quantity and quality of clean hydrogen solutions, including production, distribution,
storage and end uses developed in the Union;
2. Strengthen the knowledge and capacity of scientific and industrial actors along the
Union’s hydrogen value chain, while supporting the uptake of industry-related skills;
3. Carry out demonstrations of clean hydrogen solutions with the view to local, regional
and Union-wide deployment, aiming at involving stakeholders in all Member States and
addressing renewable production, distribution, storage, and use for transport and
energy-intensive industries as well as other applications;
4. Increase public and private awareness, acceptance, and uptake of clean hydrogen
solutions, in particular through cooperation with other European partnerships under
Horizon Europe.
The last specific objective concerning the co-operation with other European partnerships
reflects the importance of hydrogen as a fuel, energy carrier and energy storage medium, with
application in all end-use sectors. Therefore, it is deemed important that the Clean Hydrogen
JU establishes a structured collaboration with many other Horizon Europe partnerships. This
aspect is discussed in more detail in Section 4.1.
40 Some objectives by 2030: produce clean hydrogen at around €1.5-3/kg, which will require reaching
the 2030 targets in efficiency improvement and lowering CAPEX costs. In addition, this also assumes
the availability of renewable electricity at favourable prices, as well as allowing penetration into mass
markets, and reducing distribution costs to less than €1/kg of hydrogen at scale.
273. Research and Innovation Activities
Structure of the Clean Hydrogen JU Programme
The Programme of the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking has been structured so as to cover
all aspects of the hydrogen value chain.
Figure 1 Overview of the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking activities
Its main focus will be on research and innovation actions on renewable hydrogen production,
but also hydrogen transmission, distribution and storage, alongside stationary and transport
end-use technologies, with a strong emphasis on “circularity and safety by design”:
Pillar 1: Renewable Hydrogen Production (Section 3.2)
Pillar 2: Hydrogen storage and distribution (Section 3.3)
Pillar 3: Hydrogen end uses
Pillar 3.1: Transport applications (Section 3.4)
Pillar 3.2: Clean heat and power (Section 3.5)
In addition to working within each of these pillars, mass deployment requires support and
coordination action, but also flagship actions41 to be taken at system level. They are thus
complemented by four additional horizontal and cross-cutting activities, necessary as follows:
Horizontal Activity 1: Cross-cutting Issues (Section 3.6)
Horizontal Activity 2: Hydrogen Valleys (Section 3.7)
Horizontal Activity 3: Hydrogen Supply Chains (Section 3.8)
Horizontal Activity 4: Strategic Research Challenges (Section 3.9)
For each Pillar and Horizontal Activity, specific objectives are described, accompanied by a
41 The definition of flagship projects can be found in Section 5.2.
28number of actions42 aiming to contribute towards their achievement. These actions comprise of
long-term, breakthrough-oriented research, applied research and technology development,
demonstrations and supporting actions, including strategic studies, pre-normative actions and
technology assessment. All these elements are described in detail in Section 0. The research
and innovation activities are complemented by a number of additional activities described in
Section 4.
Types of Actions in the SRIA
Research and Innovation Actions consisting of activities aiming to establish new
knowledge (Early Stage Research Actions) and/or to explore the feasibility of a new or
improved technology, product, process, service or solution (Development Stage Research
Actions). Such actions target in general lower Technology Readiness Level (TRL).
Innovation Actions consisting of activities aimed at producing plans and arrangement or
designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services, and will include
prototypes, demonstrations or pilot, and market replication activities. Projects may include
limited research & innovation activities and have in general a higher TRL.
Coordination and support actions consisting, inter alia, of measures such as
standardisation, dissemination, awareness raising and communication, networking,
coordination or support services, and studies.
Renewable Hydrogen production
Most of the hydrogen that is currently being produced in the EU and worldwide is produced
from fossil fuels – either by steam reforming of natural gas or gasification of coal. If hydrogen
is to realise its potential to be an energy vector in a decarbonised economy, it needs to be
produced on a mass scale in a sustainable way. For that to happen, renewable hydrogen needs
to become cost-competitive and its technologies need to be scaled up in a fashion similar to
renewable technologies during the last decade. For renewable hydrogen to be competitive with
conventional fuels in transport applications, a cost around 5 €/kg at the pump must be achieved
for cost parity with diesel fuel43, which can be further lowered though through the aid of the
recently proposed ETS-2 and some of the new measures included in the revision of the Effort
Sharing Decision. For Industry, renewable hydrogen costs must reach levels between 2-3 €/kg
as a feedstock44, in order to achieve parity with fossil-based inputs, once the cost of carbon is
included in the feedstock cost.
To reach this objective, further improvements are required especially in cost reduction and
efficiency increase for a variety of renewable hydrogen production routes, the main workhorse
being electrolysis, supported by other routes exploiting direct sunlight such as thermal
dissociation of water using concentrated solar energy or through photocatalysis,
biomass/biogas or other biological routes. Through electrolysis, higher and more efficient
42 The actions proposed for all the pillars are based on the final draft of the SRIA-HE/HER (October
2020). These should be considered indicative, especially considering the dynamic and fast growing
field of research and development in hydrogen technologies, which may very likely shift the priorities
over the next few years.

Europe and Hydrogen Europe Research

2020
29integration of renewables within the overall energy system can be also achieved.
Water electrolysis will be the main technology supported, covering high TRL types - Alkaline
Electrolysis (AEL), Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis (PEMEL), Solid Oxide Electrolysis
(SOEL) - and less mature types - Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolysis (AEMEL) and Proton
Conducting Ceramic Electrolysis (PCCEL).
As presented in Annex 2, state of the art electrical consumption at stack level is 50 kWh/kg for
AEL and 55 kWh/kg of hydrogen for PEMEL while the target for 2030 is for these figures to be
reduced to 48 kWh/kg for AEL and 50 kWh/kg for PEMEL (69% efficiency, LHV). For SOEL
current 40 kWh /kg for SOEL and 10 kWh /kg is to be reduced to 37 kWh /kg and 8 kWh /kg
e th e th
by 2030. Similarly, the current cost of MW-size AEL electrolysers is 600 €/kW, for PEM 900
€/kW and 2,130 €/kW for SOEL. These costs are to be reduced to 400 €/kW, 500 €/kW and
520 €/kW for AEL, PEM and SOEL respectively by 2030. Further reduction could be achieved
through streamlined manufacturing processes. In regions where renewable electricity is cheap,
electrolysers are expected to be able to compete with fossil-based hydrogen in 2030.
Cheap renewable electricity can be produced onshore, but also offshore. The EU Strategy on
Offshore Renewable Energy proposes to increase Europe's offshore wind capacity from its
current level of 12 GW to at least 60 GW by 2030 and to 300 GW by 2050. Particular attention
therefore will be paid to offshore renewable Hydrogen production.
Clean Hydrogen JU’s support to hydrogen production demonstration will be limited to
renewable hydrogen, while support to low-carbon hydrogen production could be provided by
other EU funding programmes, such as the Innovation Fund, or by other partnerships within
Horizon Europe. Low-carbon hydrogen, however, is not excluded from the hydrogen storage,
distribution and end-use activities of this SRIA.
Electrolysis
Rationale for Support
Water electrolysis has been used to produce hydrogen in industry for nearly a century.
Electrolysis has the potential to be a zero-emission form of hydrogen production, if powered by
renewables45. Electrolysis is a key means for enabling renewable energy penetration into all
sectors, with electrolytic hydrogen being produced at, or transported to, the points of use.
Renewable hydrogen produced through electrolysis enables the increased penetration of
variable renewable energy into hard to decarbonise sectors like industry, transport, building &
heating. However, considerable development of electrolyser technology, cost, performance
and durability, connectivity to renewables, water management and the scale of deployment is
still needed to achieve this vision. Other technologies such as reversible electrolysis and co-
electrolysis will contribute to technology progress, widening the impact to the energy and
industrial sectors.
Approximately 8 Mt/year of hydrogen46 is currently used in Europe in a wide range of industrial
processes (mainly refining & ammonia production). These quantities are largely fossil-based
hydrogen produced by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) from fossil natural gas and can be
replaced by renewable hydrogen. Furthermore, renewable hydrogen can replace fossil fuels as
a feedstock in other industrial processes (e.g. coke as a reducing agent in the steel

30manufacturing process, particularly in Direct Reduced Iron – DRI - furnaces) and can be used
in combination with CO (preferably sustainable), producing liquid fuels, synthetic natural gas
2
and important petrochemicals as well as an energy source for heat and power generation. The
scale and particularities of industrial forecourts dictate particular developments for electrolysers
for their successful integration.
European manufacturers and supporting industries are well placed to keep Europe as the
global leader on electrolysis technologies, securing high value jobs through manufacturing and
supply chain. R&I will be key to maintain this leadership in time.
Deployment of competitive renewable hydrogen implies the need of tackling electrolysis cost
and performance in parallel to renewable power cost (including the electrical grid), since the
cost of renewable power is the main driver of the cost of renewable hydrogen. Reaching a
competitive renewable hydrogen will request the development of dedicated renewable assets
(i.e. wind turbines, associated orchestration systems, hydro, batteries, converters,
transformers, other grid assets…). The variable nature of renewable have a direct impact on
the design of the electrolysis and respective costs (i.e. CAPEX, OPEX…). A system thinking
approach between renewable asset, electrical grid, controls and electrolysis is essential to
know which research path are the most viable to reach parity with fossil fuel-based hydrogen
production while optimising EU funding availability.
State of the Art
Water and Steam electrolysis demonstration projects for AEL, PEMEL and SOEL technologies
up to few MW scale are already operational. Projects ranging from 20 MW to more than 100
MW are under development with current hydrogen costs in the range of 5-8 €/kg. In the context
of the Green Deal Call under H2020, the European Commission launched a call for a 100 MW
electrolyser. Electrolyser OEMs are scaling up manufacturing facilities to multi-GW per annum,
some announcing targets of 1.5 $/kg of renewable hydrogen for 202547 provided low-cost
renewable power can be secured.
Alkaline systems of more than 100 MW have been deployed worldwide in industry, typically in
aluminium production, although historically they were deployed in ammonia plants which pre-
date cheap natural gas and for chlorine production in chlor-alkali electrolysis.
The largest electrolyser demonstration projects of FCH 2 JU include:
1. DJEWELS48 (2019), a 20 MW pressurised AE to be installed at Nobian’s Delfzijl site in
the Netherlands, to produce green methanol;
2. REFHYNE49 (2018), a 10 MW pressurised PEME to be installed at Shell’s Cologne
refinery;
3. H2FUTURE50 (2016), a 6 MW atmospheric PEME installed and operating since late
2019 in a steel plant in Linz;
4. MULTIPLHY51 (2019), a 2.6 MW SOEL to be installed at NESTE’s Rotterdam
biorefinery;

metal industry, including electricity grid balancing.
Objectives
Hydrogen production via electrolysis is currently more expensive than via other methods due
to the high capital costs of the electrolysers and dependence on electricity costs. The key
objectives for realising the 2030 vision are:
1. Reducing electrolyser CAPEX and OPEX;
2. Improving dynamic operation and efficiency, with high durability and reliability,
especially when operating dynamically;
3. Increasing current density and decreasing footprint;
4. Demonstrate the value of electrolysers for the power system through their ability to
provide flexibility and allow higher integration of renewables;
5. Ensure circularity by design for materials and for production processes, minimising the
life-cycle environmental footprint of electrolysers;
6. Increasing the scale of deployment;
7. Improved manufacturing for both water and steam electrolysis.
In terms of industrial scale applications of electrolysers, the goal is to replace fossil-based
hydrogen with renewable hydrogen in existing industrial uses such as NH production and
3
refineries, saving 60 MtCO per year and to successfully introduce and demonstrate the use of
2
renewable hydrogen in steel, cement and petrochemical industries that need to be converted
to use hydrogen. The Clean Hydrogen JU will not be able to provide alone the necessary
support/funding for this. Synergies will be sought with the Clean Steel and Processes4Planet
(P4P) partnerships for large scale demonstrations in the steel, cement and petrochemical
industries, as well as with Member State specific funding programmes such as the National
Recovery and Resiliency Plans (NRRP), Important Projects of Common European Interest
(IPCEI). Using the example of the steel industry, technological developments or innovations
dealing with hydrogen production, distribution and storage will be within the scope of the Clean
Hydrogen JU, while developments in new steel production plants or processes will be within
the scope of the Clean Steel and P4P partnerships54.
To ensure a cost-competitive renewable hydrogen supply chain to serve the European
economy, further research and innovation efforts are required on the hydrogen production side.
This will entail more efficient and cost-effective electrolysers, as well as upscaling to larger size,
developing electrolyser modules of tens of megawatts, which would lead to electrolyser plants
in the range of gigawatts. Together with mass-manufacturing capabilities and new materials,
they would supply renewable hydrogen to large consumers. By the end of 2030, the aim of the
EU Hydrogen Strategy is for at least 40 GW of electrolysers to be installed in Europe. Together
with improvements in efficiency, the resulting cost reductions should make it possible for
electrolysis to be capable of producing renewable hydrogen at a levelised cost of hydrogen

32below 3 €/kg assuming 40 €/MWh and 4,000 full load hours operation55.
In order to contribute towards achieving these objectives, the following areas of research and
development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
Future cost reductions and increased lifetime in the different electrolysis technologies may be
realised through new materials/manufacturing processes/concepts as per the priorities below.
• Generic for all electrolysis: Develop new electrodes and membranes, reducing / free of
critical raw materials (CRMs) and reducing / without per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
in order to avoid in the medium-long term their use in different materials or components
such as electrocatalysts, MEAs, etc, as well as novel and breakthrough cell design, to
increase the current density, while improving their lifetime and efficiency, develop low-
cost metallic materials coatings and seals, develop and validate integrated mounting
concepts, thermal management and innovative manufacturing processes;
• Development of novel catalysts (low PGM, non-PGM, bioinspired) for water
electrolysis);
• Minimisation of environmental impact / aim for circularity (energy, resources/material,
recyclability);
• AEL: develop more compact stack design, reach high current density without noble
metals, 3D electrodes, pulsed voltage;
• PEMEL: Reduce precious metals content in catalysts and consider recycling, develop
PGM-free catalysts, develop new/advanced membranes, reduce gas crossover while
increasing current densities and operating pressures;
• SOEL: pressurised stack, improved hydrogen purity at exit of stack; new stack designs
and use of advanced manufacturing techniques;
• AEMEL: improved materials, new membranes, reduction of KOH concentration,
increase scale/capacity, aiming for waste minimisation / circularity;
• PCCEL: planar or tubular cells of improved materials and optimised design and
performances in view of scaling up to hundreds of kilowatts size;
• Others: investigate the possibility of non-pure water electrolysis.
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
Several concepts for reducing electrolyser costs and improving technical Key Performance
Indicators (KPI) have been demonstrated in the laboratory. This area can support promising
applications identified through the research programme suggested above as well as:
• Improve cell design for high performance and increase cell/stack robustness through
improved thermal and process-flow management;
• Develop larger area cells/stacks components with adequate manufacturing quality for
high power systems;
55 The Future of Hydrogen, IEA, 2019
33• Consider innovative system designs and improved balance of plant components to
reduce parasitic losses and reduce cost (e.g. purpose-built rectifiers, integrated cooling
systems, electrical heaters and heat-exchangers), when relevant in optimised electrical
integration with renewables;
• Develop tools and methods for monitoring, diagnostics and control of electrolyser
systems;
• Develop high pressure stacks to avoid/reduce the need for downstream compression
or alternative compression techniques (e.g. electrochemical);
• Consider original concepts like reversible operation (electrolysis, fuel cell) and co-
electrolysis (to produce syngas);
• Explore the options for utilising by-product oxygen and waste heat;
• Develop new stack and balance of plant (BoP) designs adapted to several end uses,
e.g. onshore and offshore windmill direct connection, coupling with renewables in
remote areas and related constraints.
R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
• Projects are needed to demonstrate that electrolysis technology, when deployed at
scale, has the potential to meet cost and performance KPIs, thus demonstrating novel
integration concepts, use cases or business models validated in demo activities;
• Develop automation and quality control processes for continuous production of large
volumes of cell/stacks components;
• Demonstrate at the MW range the alternative electrolysis technologies – AEMEL and
PCCEL;
• Provide a compelling economic and environmental case for key applications e.g.
feedstock for industries, transport, energy storage, heat and power;
• Operate with variable load and adequate flexibility to be coupled with renewable energy;
• MW scale direct coupling to renewable generation (both on- and off-grid) including
offshore hydrogen production, aiming at identifying the best system configuration to
reach competitiveness;
• Integrating large scale electrolysers (50-200 MW) into industrial production plants,
demonstrating dynamic operation;
• Renewable hydrogen (both on and off-grid) for refining crude oil into complex fuels (e.g.
kerosene/jet fuel);
• Ammonia and methanol production with renewable hydrogen (both on and off-grid) to
decrease GHG emissions and managing energy loads;
• Production of synthetic petrochemicals (e.g. olefins, BTX and syngas) using renewable
hydrogen (both on and off-grid);
• Demonstrate the ability of renewable hydrogen (both on and off-grid) as a reducing
agent in iron and steel production (replacing fossil fuels such as coke and natural gas);
• Consider industrial applications where oxygen and electrolysis waste heat could also
be exploited besides renewable hydrogen (both on and off-grid).
34Flagship Actions
Support for flagship projects recognises the environmental advantages of electrolysis and helps
them to realise further cost reductions by creating true demand at scale (e.g. 100 x 10 MW
systems per year per manufacturer). The integration of large-scale electrolysers in particular in
industrial / building environments could lead to changes to their specifications in order to obtain
installation and operation permits, the process providing valuable feedback to the electrolysis
industry. In terms of capacity, such flagship projects should aim to develop and demonstrate
single modules of large capacity (few tens of megawatts) which when repeated in commercial
projects could achieve hundreds of megawatts capacity, on-grid or off-grid, onshore or offshore.
Synergies
Potential synergies will be explored with P4P and Clean Steel partnerships in successfully
demonstrating the use of renewable hydrogen in industry. Possible synergies may also be
explored with the CETP partnership. See Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the
synergies.
Other routes of renewable hydrogen production
Rationale for Support
Traditionally, hydrogen has been produced from fossil sources by steam methane reforming of
natural gas. However, hydrogen can also be produced from a broad range of renewable energy
sources, the technology of first choice being water electrolysis using renewable electricity.
Solutions at lower Technology Readiness Level need also to be incentivised and developed,
such as hydrogen production from biological origin (e.g. algae, microbes) through several
processes (e.g. dark fermentation), from direct solar water splitting using solar thermal heat or
direct sunlight (photonic energy), or from pyrolysis/gasification processes for hydrogen
production from biomass/biogas with solid carbon as a by-product. At the same time, attention
needs to be paid to sustainability requirements – these routes could potentially be
environmentally positive. The topic of pyrolysis and carbon black production is outside the
scope of the current SRIA and will be covered through the synergies with P4P.
State of the Art
Gasification of biomass and biowaste is an area being actively pursued by several SMEs
worldwide. Some small-scale demonstration plants have operated successfully (e.g. Gas Goes
Green Programme56 in the UK), yet there are no MW scale plants operating. The FCH 2 JU
has supported renewable hydrogen production from dry biomass through gasification or the
reforming of raw biogas in novel reactors but efficiencies reached were around 40% (project
BIONICO).
Similarly, the FCH 2 JU has supported projects related to the thermal dissociation of water
using concentrated light culminating to the construction of a demonstration plant of 750 kW
th
(Hydrosol-Plant57) concluding that there is considerable room for further improvement in
materials and processes as there is a significant gap between the theoretical and measured
efficiency (25 and less than 1% respectively). There is a range of technologies being explored
at the laboratory scale for using solar energy to split water by photochemical and
photoelectrochemical means. Solar to renewable hydrogen efficiencies higher than 20% have
56 https://www.energynetworks.org/creating-tomorrows-networks/gas-goes-green
57 https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/219835/factsheet/en
35been reached on small specimens in the lab, dropping to 10% for cells of a few m² operating
with sunlight (project PECSYS).
In terms of biological processes, the FCH JU has supported only one project (HYTIME) and
there is a need to move beyond the pilot-plant to demonstration scale. In the case of bio-
electrochemical processes, there are several pilot-plant systems throughout the world using
different types of feedstocks, producing hydrogen and other by-products from different
wastewaters. Currently, higher volume reactors range from 120 litres to 1 m³, with a maximum
hydrogen purity between 94% and around 100%. The EU has supported under FP7 some low
TRL projects for the treatment of wastewater, or other wastes, and the simultaneous production
of hydrogen (Waste2bioHy58).
Objectives
The objective of the research and innovation support to be provided by the Clean Hydrogen JU
will aim to make a range of technologies available by 2030 which can produce renewable, low
cost (around 3 €/kg including feedstock cost) hydrogen operating either at distributed or central
facilities with capacities approaching MW of hydrogen production, with reduced land use.
The objectives can be summarised below:
1. Reducing CAPEX and OPEX
2. Improving the efficiency of processes
3. Increasing carbon yield for processes based on biomass/raw biogas (kg hydrogen / kg
carbon)
4. Scaling up
The alternative renewable hydrogen production routes on which the current Programme will be
focusing are:
1. Biomass & bio-waste gasification for distributed hydrogen production, potentially
associated with carbon, capture & storage (CCS), the latter being outside the scope of
the Clean Hydrogen JU;
2. Raw biogas reforming for distributed hydrogen production, potentially associated with
CCUS (possible negative CO emissions) the latter being outside the scope of the Clean

Flagship Actions
Support for renewable hydrogen production in all deployment schemes is available from policy
and regulation. There is a case for supporting one very large-scale deployment in Europe of
the most promising direct sunlight technology given the potential for this technology to
revolutionise the energy system.
Synergies
Potential synergies will be explored with P4P especially in the field of pyrolysis of
biomass/biogas. See Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the synergies.
37Hydrogen storage and distribution
As explicitly mentioned in the EU Hydrogen Strategy, it is essential that hydrogen becomes an
intrinsic part of an integrated energy system. In order for this to happen, hydrogen will have to
be used for daily and/or seasonal storage providing buffering functions thereby enhancing
security of supply in the medium term. The strategy also calls for an EU-wide logistical
infrastructure that needs to be developed in order to transport hydrogen from areas with large
renewable potential to demand centres across Europe. Consequently, a pan-European grid will
have to be established59 along with a far-reaching network of Hydrogen Refuelling Stations60.
A policy brief61 by the Joint Research Centre assessing hydrogen delivery options concludes
that there is no single optimal hydrogen delivery solution across every transport scenario. The
most cost effective way to deliver renewable hydrogen depends on a number of parameters,
notably distance, amount of hydrogen, final use and whether there is infrastructure already
available. The calculation becomes even more complex when the whole coupled energy
system and its congestion management costs and capabilities to integrate renewables are
considered, taking into due account electricity, molecules and heat (as a single whole).
In general, the development of infrastructure requires significant investments and should
therefore be planned in a sound manner across the whole energy system, not only at vehicle
or hydrogen production and delivery level, to avoid costly stranded assets and duplications (for
instance between gaseous and liquid hydrogen infrastructure).
For distances compatible with the European territory, compressed and liquefied hydrogen
solutions, and especially compressed hydrogen pipelines, offer lower costs than chemical
carriers do. The repurposing of existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen use is expected to
significantly lower the delivery cost, making the pipeline option even more competitive in the
future. By contrast, chemical carriers become more competitive the longer the delivery distance
(due to their lower transport costs) and thus can more easily be traded in the global hydrogen
markets.
In line with the above, a pluralistic approach with respect to the technologies that will be
investigated and supported is envisaged, in order to have a complete set of technologies that
can serve as building blocks of the EU-wide logistical infrastructure.
Hydrogen Storage
Rationale for Support
For hydrogen to become a key solution in the energy transition and to enable the integration of
intermittent renewable energy sources in the grid there needs to be an available and low-cost
form of bulk storage that can act as a buffer but also in order to support the industrial use of
hydrogen. Large-scale seasonal energy storage can be achieved by storing hydrogen in
underground salt caverns and gas fields, which are located in many places in Europe. Some of
the salt caverns, which are used to store natural gas today, could be repurposed to store
59 The Commission is expected to propose specific policy measures in this direction in the upcoming
Hydrogen and Gas markets Decarbonisation Package.
60 The revised Directive on deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (AFIR) requires Member
States to ensure a minimum number of accessible hydrogen refuelling stations by 2030: (a) one HRS
with a minimum 2 tonnes/day capacity and at least a 700 bar dispenser per 150 km along the TEN-T
core, (b) at least HRS in each urban node, and (c) at least one liquid hydrogen HRS per 450 km. The
JU will examine ways to support its implementation.

38hydrogen. However, as underground storage sites are not so common, there will also be a need
to store large quantities of hydrogen above ground in large pressurised cylinders, in liquid form
or in solid-state to reduce footprint and improve safety to support the hydrogen clusters of the
future.
State of the Art
Hydrogen has been successfully stored at a large scale for industrial applications for many
years. For example, underground gas storage sites in salt caverns were used to store hydrogen
in the Teesside chemical complex in the UK for many years.
The industrial and chemicals sector is very experienced in handling and storing large quantities
of hydrogen in salt caverns (Gulf coast). Europe’s industrial actors have tremendous
experience in storing large quantities of natural gas in porous or natural caverns. Further work
will be necessary to enrich this expertise for the storage of hydrogen in this media.
Large-scale hydrogen industrial storage sites are linked with the pipeline networks in the
Benelux region and in Teesside, UK. The storage of hydrogen through blending is also being
tested in Europe in aquifer and depleted gas reservoirs.62
Regarding cryogenic options, it should be stressed that over the past decade Europe has
developed a unique industrial expertise in cryogenic storage for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).
It therefore has the industrial and academic competences to support the development of liquid
cryogenic hydrogen storage.
Objectives
1. To undertake research aimed at improving cost and efficiency of aboveground storage
solutions.
2. To demonstrate distributed aboveground storage solutions available at a capital cost
lower than 300 €/kg by 2030
3. To undertake research activities on underground storage to validate the performance in
different geologies, to identify better and more cost effective materials and to encourage
improved designs.
4. Demonstrate the large-scale underground storage across various media at a capital
cost lower than 30 €/kg by 2030
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
Develop novel concepts that can reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of hydrogen
storage at a bulk level. This includes the use of lower pressure (lower cost) vessels in concert
with low-cost hydride or adsorbent storage materials with high reversibility (higher than 90% of
original storage capacity over at least 1,000 cycles) using lower targets for weight density than
needed for other applications.
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
Development projects are required to develop the maturity of new concepts for aboveground
and underground storage and their integration into the energy system including energy system
62
39modelling. Examples of areas for development are:
• Sustainable and safe designs for underground storage and the associated aboveground
infrastructure more suited to energy system applications. This should include improving
discharge rates and increasing pressure ranges within the underground storage, while
also addressing the purity aspects for the recovery of hydrogen from the storage media;
• Studies on materials to enable long-lasting wells in hydrogen underground storage.
Consequently, address costs reduction of these materials, if possible;
• Studies on lined mined caverns for storing hydrogen when neither salt nor porous media
are available. Cryogenic and pressurised solutions to be considered;
• Studies on microbial activity and effects depending on the underground media;
• Developing low-cost materials and system architectures for aboveground storage tanks,
targeting optimised pressures;
• Storage using solid nanostructured absorbers (microporous materials, metal-organic
framework materials - MOFs);
• Low cost metal hydride and adsorbent hydrogen storage materials;
• Novel designs and hybrid solutions for storage containers;
• Techno-economic analysis on the optimisation of the logistics and operation for
hydrogen underground storage (iteration with the power market -including ancillaries
congestion management and network physics basics-, and renewable energy
production, transport strategies, electrolysis operation mode, sizing, etc);
• Feasibility studies are further proposed to study the consequences of hydrogen over
main natural gas underground storage infrastructures (e.g. reservoir, wells and
treatments plants). In particular:
o Effects on cap rock and reservoir integrity due to diffusion issues and
acidification of reservoir fluids;
o Changes on the storage efficiency due to diffusion issues, geochemical &
microbiological reactions that could impact on the gas quality, effective porosity
& permeability, losses in pressure & energy;
o Wells integrity (cement, tubular couplings & elastomers);
o Changes on surface facilities efficiency (fluids & treatment process) and
integrity.
R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
A demonstration phase is necessary to highlight the readiness of hydrogen storage for
integration within the overall energy system. There is the need for demonstrations of projects
for both aboveground and underground operation, aiming to reduce cost and improve
efficiency, including:
• Medium-scale projects to both prove and optimise aboveground hydrogen storage
solutions. Examples here could be:
o Bulk hydrogen storage for residential quarters running on hydrogen energy;
o Bulk hydrogen storage for local hydrogen distribution centres;
40o Bulk hydrogen storage for Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS) in densely
populated regions;
o Bulk hydrogen storage for isolated systems in remote territories such as islands
with high penetration of intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (RES)
• A large-scale demonstration project for underground hydrogen storage that is
progressing in terms of state of the art. (e.g. in terms of capacity, or volumetric density).
Flagship Action
• Flagship action for a bulk underground storage of hydrogen of at least 250,000 m³.
Alternatively, future projects should focus on including large-scale storage within large-
scale projects.
• Policy studies should be used to develop the underpinning evidence on the need for
bulk hydrogen storage for energy or for other industrial applications. This should be
done in order to make the case for policy and regulatory support for market activation.
Synergies
Potential synergies can be explored with P4P in successfully demonstrating underground
storage of hydrogen in depleted gas fields. Other potential synergies can be identified with the
Innovation Fund, which foresees the funding of large-scale energy storage projects. See
Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the synergies.
Hydrogen in the Natural Gas Grid
Rationale for Support
According to the recent Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Package proposed by the European
Commission63, low carbon hydrogen and other low carbon or carbon neutral gaseous fuels are
expected to gradually replace the use of fossil gas. In terms of transportation of hydrogen via
pipelines, developing a dedicated hydrogen infrastructure in the long-term is necessary to
release the full potential of this energy carrier is specific end-use applications. In the short and
medium term, other forms of low-carbon gases in particular low-carbon hydrogen can play a
role, primarily to rapidly reduce emissions from existing hydrogen production and support the
parallel and future uptake of renewable hydrogen.
Therefore, the deployment of various renewable and low carbon types of gases is likely to
happen in parallel and is expected to develop at a different pace across the EU, requiring:
• a hydrogen-based infrastructure to progressively complement the natural gas grid;
• a gas infrastructure where natural gas will progressively be replaced by clean gases.
Beyond the importance of the natural gas grid for transporting the hydrogen molecule across
long distances, it also offers an enormous storage potential, which can play a critical role in a
climate neutral future. There is therefore a significant energy system benefit in using existing
gas assets, as they can provide large seasonal storage potential and help manage large swings
in daily demand.
The pathways that will be explored for the decarbonisation of the natural gas grid and for the
63 Proposal for Regulation “Internal markets for renewable and natural gases and for hydrogen
(recast)”. COM(2021) 804 final, December 2021.
41distribution of hydrogen are the following:
• Blending hydrogen with natural gas;
• Repurposing natural gas pipelines for transmission and distribution of 100% hydrogen;
• Building new pipelines for 100% hydrogen transmission and distribution.
ACER conducted a study on “Transporting Pure Hydrogen by Repurposing Existing Gas
Infrastructure: Overview of existing studies and reflections on the conditions for repurposing”.64
The study concludes that all the following conditions should be met in order to consider
repurposing for hydrogen as a serious option:
• Presence of loop (parallel) lines of NG pipeline systems, of which at least one string
could be repurposed for pure hydrogen.
• Ensuring security of NG supply to consumers, during and after the conversion of a line
(or loop) to pure hydrogen. This means that there should be free available capacity for
NG transport in that segment of the network, or alternative routes of supply.
• Hydrogen market uptake in the location or regions serving that pure hydrogen corridor.
There should be supply developments of low carbon hydrogen production from RES or
CSS, synchronously with demand developments. This hydrogen demand could stem
from switching from “grey” to “green” or “blue” hydrogen for existing hydrogen industrial
consumers, and switching from fossil fuels (coal, gas) to hydrogen for new hydrogen
industrial consumers for high-grade heat applications.
The study notes that it is unclear when and where these conditions would be met (if at all).
Timing for repurposing NG pipelines would be highly dependent on hydrogen market
developments and therefore relative investment decisions should follow a prudent and no-
regrets approach.
State of the Art
Injecting hydrogen into the natural gas distribution networks is technically feasible today.
Depending on the specific network and / or region, as pipeline networks vary significantly
between Member States, blends of hydrogen up to 20% by volume may be possible without
requiring pipeline or appliance conversion. High-pressure transmission pipelines have more
uncertainties, regarding the impact of hydrogen depending on the materials that are utilised
and the pressure ranges of operation. Projects like HyDeploy65 (UK) and Hyblend66 (US) aim
to understand how higher concentrations of hydrogen could work on different parts of the gas
grid and what could be their effects on piping and pipeline materials. In all cases, safety must
also be assessed.
For deeper decarbonisation, conversion to 100% hydrogen is possible. Conversion of parts of
the gas T&D infrastructure to 100% hydrogen is under consideration in the UK (H2167, H10068,
HYNET69) and plans are developing in countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium,
France and Slovakia. In these cases, existing transmission and distribution infrastructure could

42be repurposed for hydrogen. Existing pipelines, as a whole or certain of their critical
components, need to be adapted to tolerate hydrogen content. Similarly, other system
components, including compression and drivetrain solutions, may need to be replaced. For
these purposes, international research and innovation actions across Europe will be important.
There are several demonstration projects injecting hydrogen into natural gas distribution grids,
generally up to 20% in terms of volume70,71. Limited demonstrations of conversions of steel
pipes to 100% hydrogen are commencing. An example is a 12 km pipeline formerly used for
transporting natural gas that has been transformed for transportation of 100% hydrogen in the
south west of the Netherlands72 in 2018.Another example is the launch of the “NortH2” in
Groningen that is expected to produce and distribute around 800,000 tonnes of hydrogen
through Gasunie’s natural gas infrastructure.73
The formation European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) initiative is another indication for the
increasing momentum on the repurposing of natural gas pipelines in Europe. The EHB group
vision currently involves 23 gas infrastructure companies from 21 countries. In their most recent
report it presents a vision for a 39,700km hydrogen pipeline infrastructure expanding in 21
countries. Two-thirds of the network is based on repurposing of natural gas pipelines.74
Objectives
1. Development of technologies and materials to explore and support the
transportation of H2 via the natural gas grid.
2. Enable through research and demonstration activities the transportation of
hydrogen through the natural gas grid either by blending or via repurposing to 100%
hydrogen.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
• Develop testing techniques in order to precisely map the influence of hydrogen on
different pipeline materials
• Qualify the effects of hydrogen on the following types of materials and components:
o Grades of steel in pipes and their welded joints and induced phenomena
(embrittlement, crack propagation, etc);
o Metallic materials existing in the distribution network (cast iron, copper, brass,
lead, aluminium) and induced phenomena (embrittlement, propagation of
cracks, fatigue, etc);
o Materials of elastomer types present mainly in equipment in the distribution
network (regulator membranes, meters, etc).
• Precisely model the influence of hydrogen including blends on identified safety and risk

• Develop insight in the effects of contamination in existing networks on the purity of the
hydrogen at the exit point.
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
• Develop technologies to limit the impact of hydrogen on the existing network using an
internal coating and in situ robotic application or other solutions (e.g. pipe in pipe);
• Identification and development of new materials (steels, joints, components, coatings)
optimised for hydrogen transport;
• Develop time energy content tracking for energy billing that are able to cope with
admixtures;
• Specify, develop and adapt leak detection/tracking tools in the presence of hydrogen;
• Compact blending and mixing units for hydrogen injection;
• Check the metrological response and the potential drift of metering at different levels of
hydrogen rate under dynamic network conditions;
• Qualify the impact of hydrogen on network compressor stations and its components, as
well as components regularly found in metering and regulating stations such as filters,
heat exchangers, pressure regulators and develop new compatible components;
• Since a major cost component for hydrogen transport through pipelines is the
construction cost of new infrastructure, actions aimed at understanding the techno-
economic potential for repurposing natural gas pipelines should be supported.
R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
• Develop methods for connecting current off-grid projects to the gas market;
• Construct local demonstration projects both for hydrogen blending and pure hydrogen
pipelines with cross border participation, aiming to a gradual shift to pure hydrogen
pipelines.
Flagship Actions
Flagship cluster projects could be foreseen demonstrating cross border transmission.
Additionally, possible projects could focus on blending, and a mix industrial, mobility and
residential uses. A current example of the latter is the HyNet / H100 project in the UK.
Synergies
Synergies with the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) could be investigated for the Flagship
Actions. See Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the synergies.
Liquid Hydrogen Carriers
Rationale for Support
Hydrogen is one of the most dense energy carriers by mass, but it is extremely light and so the
volumetric energy density in standard conditions is very low. Moreover, liquid hydrogen carriers
are currently the only mean of importing mass quantities of renewables (TWh to PWh-order)
from long distances (Australia, South America). There is therefore a huge advantage in
44developing cost effective and efficient ways of transporting hydrogen in liquid form. This can be
done by liquefying hydrogen or by bonding it with other molecules forming hydrogen carriers
such as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), ammonia and other CO neutral carriers. In
2
order to be able to transport significant amounts of hydrogen in the coming years, all types of
hydrogen carriers will be considered.
State of the Art
Conventional liquefaction of hydrogen is a mature technology but has not been subject to
significant innovation in recent decades. There is therefore scope to improve cost, scale and
efficiency. Several companies are developing hydrogen carriers as well as technology to
recover pure hydrogen out of these carriers, some of which, however, have not yet been
deployed at an industrial scale.
There is interest in a range of hydrogen carriers, which could provide energy efficient, safe and
practicable solutions to transport hydrogen. They give the opportunity to be used directly or to
allow pure hydrogen recovery for enabling safe and affordable mid-size to large-scale energy
storage and dispatch hydrogen storage. Few examples are:
• Hydrogen Liquefaction: liquefaction is a conventional means of transporting hydrogen.
Hydrogen is cooled to -253°C. After liquefaction, liquid hydrogen is transported in super-
insulated “cryogenic” tankers. At the distribution site, it is vaporised to a high-pressure
gaseous product. During the transfer of liquid hydrogen, some is evaporated due to
boil-off, which leads to certain losses of hydrogen. The same phenomenon happens
during storage but at a far lower level.
• LOHCs: LOHCs are typically hydrogen-rich aromatic and alicyclic molecules that can
be easily transported using existing infrastructure. The hydrogenation reaction occurs
at elevated hydrogen pressures of 10-50 bar and is exothermic. Dehydrogenation is
endothermic and occurs at low pressures. The unloaded carrier is returned to the
production site for reloading with possible degradation of the carrier happening
depending on chemistries, catalysts, operating conditions and number of cycles. Work
has been done on this topic already within FCH 2 JU project HYSTOC that aims to
demonstrate the feasibility of the LOHC technology for the distribution and storage of
hydrogen to supply Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS).75
• Ammonia: Ammonia production via renewable hydrogen is receiving increasing interest
as costs of renewable energy drop. Conventional ammonia production via the Haber-
Bosch process must be adapted for proper integration with renewable hydrogen.
Ammonia cracking is done in the presence of a catalyst and generates hydrogen which
is followed by a purification step. Development of novel catalysts for the
cracking/reforming process could be foreseen. However, it should be noted that actions
under the topic of ammonia synthesis are outside the scope of the Clean Hydrogen
Joint Undertaking.
Objectives
1. To increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of hydrogen liquefaction technologies.
2. To contribute to the roll-out of next generation liquefaction technology to new bulk
hydrogen production plants.
75 https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/213080_en.html
453. To continue the research on carrier cycling performance, chemistries, catalysis and
reactors which show potential for improved roundtrip efficiency and life cycle
assessment.
4. Develop a range of hydrogen carriers that will be used commercially to transport and
store hydrogen while improving their roundtrip efficiency and lowering their cost.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
• Hydrogen liquefaction:
o Energy efficiency improvements and cost reductions could come from next
generation materials and technology for liquefaction such as new cooling
materials and devices for cryogenic vessels;
o Support would target innovations with the potential to reduce energy cost of
liquefaction, reduce boil off losses, improve efficiency and improve reliability.
• Hydrogen Carriers
o Develop novel catalysts and reactor technologies;
o Reduce the amount of expensive raw materials needed in hydrogenation /
dehydrogenation reactions;
o Reduce the CO equivalent footprint (including carrier supply chain and potential
2
degradation);
o Electrochemical reforming or synthesis of hydrogen carriers
o Research on the potential hazards (e.g. toxicity, flammability) associated with
hydrogen packaging solutions is needed due to their presence in new settings.
This research should lead to the development of adequate technological
solutions and the elaboration of safety regulations.76
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
• Hydrogen Liquefaction:
o Development of new, more energy efficient and lower cost small-scale LH -
2
production processes.
o Design of new processes able to follow fluctuations in hydrogen demand and
variable renewable power inputs.
• Hydrogen carriers:
o Development of most promising concepts from early stage work into working
prototype systems, with a focus on new technologies with improved safety, cost
and performance. In addition, the possibility of flexible operation of plants in
order to profit from favourable low electricity prices should be investigated, in
order to bring down costs.77
76
46o Upscale from the prototype to large-scale plants.
o Studies on designing and optimising large capacity hydrogenation and
dehydrogenation plants.
R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
• Hydrogen Liquefaction and micro-liquefaction: One demonstration project may be
supported, based on the solutions validated in the early stage R&D projects;
• Hydrogen carriers: Most promising concepts which have been developed will be
deployed in a real-world application.
Flagship Actions
Flagship actions may be required once the technology readiness has improved and the costs
have been lowered. The different hydrogen transportation options are expected to compete for
the different end-uses.
Synergies
Potential synergies can be explored with P4P, which is also envisaging work to be done for
Ammonia, methanol and LOHCs as hydrogen carriers. See Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more
details on the synergies.
Improving Existing Hydrogen Transport means
Rationale for Support
Hydrogen presents unique challenges for transportation and distribution due to its low
volumetric density. If hydrogen is to become a widespread energy carrier, distributed from
centralised production facilities in high volumes across large geographic areas, the scale–up
of existing transport means as well as the development of novel transportation methods
optimised for large-scale hydrogen delivery is necessary.
There are a number of transportation options that can be envisaged:
• Transportation via new-built pure hydrogen pipelines;
• Road transportation of gaseous hydrogen;
• Road transportation of liquid hydrogen;
• Shipping of bulk liquid hydrogen.
State of the Art
Pipelines are the leading option for delivering large volumes of hydrogen over land. In Europe
there are already more than 1,000 km dedicated hydrogen pipelines serving the industry, albeit
in a very concentrated geographical region. This network should be expanded by new build
pure hydrogen pipelines. Development of new high strength materials resistant to hydrogen
cracking can increase the pressure and capacity of hydrogen pipelines, decreasing the cost of
transportation. Dedicated hydrogen networks remain necessary where hydrogen applications
require different pressures and purities, particularly where high purity hydrogen is required.
Hydrogen as chemical feedstock requires different purities than hydrogen for combustion, or
hydrogen for fuel cell use.
The main limitation for road transport of gaseous hydrogen is that most tube trailers in operation
47today deliver small quantities of compressed hydrogen gas (up to 300kg of hydrogen per
delivery) at a low pressure (up to 200bar). The development of a tube trailers at increased
pressure and capacity will reduce costs per kg hydrogen delivered. The ambition is the
development of a 700 bar tube trailer (capacity 1,500kg) in the coming years.
Hydrogen in liquid form is the most conventional means of transporting bulk hydrogen on the
road. Hydrogen is stored at -253°C in super-insulated ‘cryogenic’ tankers. However,
liquefaction is energy intensive and the storage and transport of the liquid hydrogen results in
heat ingress and hydrogen losses due to evaporation. “Boil-off” losses can be reduced by
improved insulation concepts or, as illustrated by NASA, by an integrated refrigeration and
storage system. It should be noted that most of the boil-off happens during transfer phase
(Storage to Trailer, Trailer to local storage), far above the vaporisation inside storage tanks.
Overseas transport and global trading of renewable energy between regions rich and short in
energy will become essential at some point in time. Overall, Europe is expected to import
renewable energy. Shipping of bulk LH follows in essence the business model of today’s LNG
2
shipping and trading. Kawasaki Heavy Industry has built the first LH vessel78 as a
2
demonstration project. Further technology development is required for the scale-up of LH
2
containment, systems integration and overall ship design.
Objectives
1. To increase the pressure and capacity for new builds of 100% hydrogen pipelines while
reducing their cost.
2. To reduce road transport costs of compressed hydrogen by increasing the capacity of
tube trailers.
3. To improve the efficiency of road transport of liquid hydrogen while reducing costs.
4. To enable scale-up of solutions for shipping of bulk liquid hydrogen and support its
commercialisation.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
• Early phase development of new high strength and lightweight materials (both steel and
fibre reinforced polymers) resistant to pure hydrogen;
• Welding processes consistent with 100% hydrogen content;
• Research into hydrogen embrittlement / permeation;
• Odorisation of hydrogen in dedicated pipelines, i.e. chemical additives acting as
odorants that minimise the negative effects for the use in fuel cells.
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
• Development of very high capacity pressurised tube trailer concepts (e.g. at 700 bar);
• Optimisation of transport and storage of liquid hydrogen in road transport, minimising /
eliminating hydrogen losses by evaporation. Potential areas for development are
improved insulation concepts and the implementation of an integrated refrigeration and
78 https://global.kawasaki.com/en/corp/newsroom/news/detail/?f=20191211_3487

• Development of new thermal insulation concepts and their integration with the
containment tank for the scale-up and cost reduction of shipping of bulk LH ;
2
• Development of dedicated hydrogen terminals and/or the co-existence of LNG and
hydrogen terminals, including investigating and developing methods for the adaptation
of LNG terminals towards H .

R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
A study that considers multiple hydrogen transportation methods may be required before any
actions. The key objective of the study would be the techno-economic comparison between the
different transportation methods, integration and the optimisation of the hydrogen logistics as
a whole.
Flagship Actions
Growing markets for hydrogen and hydrogen applications should provide the pull needed to
reach volumes for distribution methods.
No funding from the Programme is considered for these actions.
Synergies
No synergies have been identified.
Compression, Purification and Metering Solutions
Rationale for support
The ability to move, measure and compress hydrogen will be an important part of the transition
to using hydrogen more widely in the energy system. Today, a limited range of auxiliary
equipment exists for the distribution of hydrogen, and there is considerable scope for
optimisation of the efficiency and cost of these components. More specifically:
• Compression – There is wide range of applications within the Hydrogen Economy that
are requiring purpose built hydrogen compressors. As an example, for the transport
sector hydrogen needs to be pressurised above 700 bar to enable refuelling of high-
pressure storage tanks and in the range of 100 bar for injecting in pipelines.
Furthermore, hydrogen refuelling stations have intermittent usage which means
compressors are subject to stop-start loads. There is a need to create compressors
designed for purpose with better reliability, lower cost and higher efficiency than today.
• Metering, piping and instrumentation – the accuracy of current hydrogen meters needs
to be sized up and improved. There is a need for more accurate, larger and cheaper
meters, sensors with an accuracy sufficient for weights, measure standards and suitable
piping, valves, spare parts compatible with hydrogen or mixture blend, as well as safety
aspects and communication protocols.
• Purification and separation – hydrogen for use in low temperature PEM fuel cells
requires a very high purity, as much as 99.999%. Current purification techniques are
costly and inefficient, novel methods to purify hydrogen at lower cost would improve the
overall supply chain. The separation of hydrogen from other gases will be valuable for
a range of future industrial uses (e.g. separation from ammonia, methane or CO
2
streams, particularly when hydrogen is present at low concentrations). A range of new
49membrane, electrochemical and thermochemical techniques are being developed to
improve processes for both purification and separation of hydrogen from different gas
streams. One of the priorities is the separation of hydrogen from hydrogen and natural
gas blends with low hydrogen content (up to 20%).
State of the Art
Currently, hydrogen compressors may be available, but are the main source of failure in
hydrogen stations. Novel techniques are only available at lab scale (metal hydride,
electrochemical). Several options are under development including liquid piston compressor,
metal hydride-based compression and electrochemical compression. Innovative compression
technologies have been supported already with projects such as H2REF, COSMHYC and
COSMHYC XL that have focused on developing solutions tailored towards Hydrogen Refuelling
Stations79. Large scale turbo compressors and their respective drivetrains are still in early
phase evaluations, but will be required for the future gas grid, when hydrogen will need to be
distributed.
European manufacturers have now developed systems with the required accuracy but work is
still required to produce cheaper systems and monitoring protocols. On the topic of metering
the FCH 2 JU has already conducted some work through the procurement of a study for the
development of a Metering Protocol for HRS.80 Still at this point however, current metering
accuracy prevents approved custody transfer for hydrogen in filling stations.
Purification is based at the moment on energy intensive pressure swing absorption (PSA).
Membrane-based purification technologies improving efficiency of hydrogen production from
hydrocarbons and intermediate carriers (e.g. ammonia) are being developed and first field tests
start to appear. Some work has been done already through FCH 2 JU projects HyGrid and
MEMPHYS that have been developing proof-of-concepts for membrane and electrochemical
separation and purification systems.81,82 It should be noted that AFCs and SOFCs do not require
purification of hydrogen from ammonia source.
Objectives
Key technologies for compression, purification and metering of hydrogen are the building blocks
of the distribution of hydrogen at large scale. Development of these technologies is therefore
critical. The overall objective will be to make sure that by the end of 2030, we have a range of
compression, purification technologies available and cost competitive enough to enable further
decrease of hydrogen distribution costs.
More specifically the main objectives will be:
1. To develop more efficient compressor and purification technologies
2. To reduce the total cost of ownership of compression and purification technologies
3. To reduce the energy and consumption and increase the recovery factor of purification
technologies
4. To increase the reliability and lifetime of compression and purification technologies
5. To improve metering technologies and standards, especially in terms of accuracy and

50protocols.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
• Hydrogen Compression:
o Development of novel and hybrid technologies for compression, including
chemical and electrochemical compression;
o Testing of electrochemical, thermal and hydride compression at low, medium
and high temperatures and pressure;
o Novel cryogenic compression approaches.
o Development of turbo compressors and their drivetrains to meet future pipeline
demands
o Upscaling of existing HRS compression technologies to meet higher demands
(high-flow) while improving their availability
• Hydrogen purification and separation:
o Development of low or free content PGM solutions;
o Concepts to increase hydrogen purity levels to 99.999% with a reduction in
energy consumption;
o The purification of hydrogen with medium and high temperature electrochemical
processes;
o Development of new purification/separation technologies (i.e. membranes,
electrochemical and thermochemical processes).
o Purity management to control the ratio between hydrogen & impurities in the
natural gas pipeline
• Material compatibility / resistance in contact with hydrogen and blends requires the
testing of the materials involved in the key technologies (compression and purification).
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
Validation projects are necessary to optimise storage and distribution technologies for
hydrogen. Development efforts should focus on the following areas:
• Producing compression units with higher performance levels (reliability, efficiency,
lifetime, capacity) and in-field testing;
• Development of large compression technologies and their drivetrains for injection of
hydrogen into gas pipelines (from 5 bar to 100-200 bar);
• Development of a greater accuracy within hydrogen sensors and flow meters;
• Projects which could reduce the cost of hydrogen separation and increase poisoning
resistance;
• Methodologies for separating hydrogen from blended natural gas at relevant separation
flow rates;
51• Reducing the energy intensity for purification through improved flow sheets for
purification system (better integration with production processes) and/or use of novel
membranes and other components.
R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
• Demonstration of novel and hybrid concepts for compression (pure hydrogen or blended
hydrogen / natural gas mixture) at a real-world scale (i.e. higher than 200kg/day for
hydrogen stations, tens of tons/day for pipeline injection);
• Demonstration of novel concepts for hydrogen purification and separation (i.e. hydrogen
purification, hydrogen separation from blended hydrogen / natural gas mixture) at a real-
world scale.
• Integration of innovative metering, piping and instrumentation technologies into the
overall hydrogen innovation actions.
Flagship Actions
No flagship actions are foreseen.
Synergies
Potential synergies with the European partnership on Metrology83 could be identified and
pursued for the topic of metering. Additionally synergies with the P4P can be foreseen that will
be also undertaking work on the topic of hydrogen purification and separation from natural gas
streams. See Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the synergies.
Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS)
Rationale for Support
Deploying hydrogen vehicles and in particular heavy-duty vehicles, is an important part of EU’s
Hydrogen Strategy. The study procured by the FCH 2 JU on Fuel Cell Hydrogen Trucks,84
which conducted a comparison of alternative powertrain technologies, showed that FCH
applications present a very promising zero-emission alternative. Due to their high operational
flexibility and relatively short refuelling time compared to electricity charging, FC heavy-duty
vehicles are particularly suited for long-haul operations.
However, in order to have a viable case for the widespread use of FC Heavy-Duty Vehicles
(HDV), it will be essential that there is an EU-wide network of publicly accessible HRS.
Furthermore, the larger heavy-duty fuelling applications such as buses and trains will require
very reliable, high capacity stations capable of delivering many tonnes each day. To address
this, the revision of the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Regulation85, requires one hydrogen
refuelling station available every 150 km along the TEN-T core network and in every urban
nodes by 2030.
State of the Art
In line with the growing number of trial and demonstration projects, there is an increasing
number of HRS in Europe. There have been so far 20 projects funded by FCH JUs that have
demonstrated HRS for both cars and buses with the most prominent in terms of deployment
83 https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/european-partnership-metrology_en
84 Study on fuel cells hydrogen trucks, FCH 2 JU, 2020
85 Regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. COM (2021) 559 final.
52being H2ME and H2ME2. In total the projects have already contributed to the commissioning
of 74 stations.86 To date, most existing HRS are dedicated to the use of passenger vehicles
and cannot be used by heavy-duty trucks due to different technological requirements for filling
up the much larger truck tanks. However, the increasing number of stations is promising, and
the existing foundation of HRS in Europe could partly be upgraded for truck-specific refuelling
soon. As refuelling infrastructure is adjusted to meet the needs of heavy-duty trucks, more
demonstration projects become feasible, providing a foundation for larger scale commercial
deployment.
European manufacturers dominate the global supply of hydrogen stations. Furthermore,
Europe has a larger deployment of hydrogen stations compared to any other region,87 which
provides greater experience in the operation and support of these stations than elsewhere. This
positions Europe to be a long-term leader in the supply of stations worldwide.
Based on the experience from the HRS deployment so far, there are significant issues with
publicly accessible stations, which can all be resolved over the coming years:
• The costs of the refuelling stations are high (both CAPEX and OPEX) which creates a
challenge in creating a competitive refuelling station business model, particularly in the
early years when utilisation is low;
• The station availability is currently too low. This creates issues for customers who
cannot rely on their hydrogen supply and can be particularly problematic for HDV users.
This situation will be partly resolved through increased throughput at the stations but
will also benefit from improved components (particularly compressors and dispensers);
• The permitting and construction process is too long – leading to a need to improve
standardisation, technical certification and also levels of education and awareness
amongst regulators;
• The design of the HRS is heavily influenced by the respective fuelling protocols which
need to be jointly developed with vehicle manufacturers to allow a safe and reliable
refuelling. Regarding maturity, refuelling protocols for Light Duty Vehicles (LDV) will be
in place more readily, while for heavy-duty vehicles there is an urgent need for their
quick development in order to enable the massive deployment of HDV foreseen by
2030;
• In addition, there is technical work which needs to be done to develop and optimise
concepts for high capacity refuelling for heavy-duty vehicles & vessels, as well as to
facilitate the use of renewable hydrogen, e.g. produced onsite by electrolysis or
biomass. Heavy-duty transport is expected to be a relevant driver for HRS deployment;
• Finally, there is a lack or limited availability of existing cross-border infrastructure and
cooperation.
Objectives
1. To tackle the technical challenges associated with heavy-duty hydrogen refuelling
stations in order to develop a commercial solution that conforms to the heavy-duty
requirements;
86 http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/198091_en.html
87 See Chapter 1 – Technology & Market Report 2021, FCHO.
532. To reduce the energy consumption of Hydrogen Refuelling Stations;
3. To increase the reliability and availability of Hydrogen Refuelling Stations;
4. To support the creation of a network of Heavy-duty HRS across Europe;
5. To decrease the total cost of ownership of Hydrogen Refuelling Stations.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
Moreover, this work will be facilitating the progress towards the AFIR objectives by investigating
technology building blocks on hydrogen infrastructure equipment and processes such as
electrolysers, safety and leak detection, transport and storage, novel compression
technologies, hydrogen quality and protocols.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
• Better interfacing technology is required between hydrogen vehicles and HRS to ensure
optimal (and safe) filling protocols;
• Increase flexibility and enable low inlet pressure are necessary to support the use of
renewable hydrogen produced on-site;
• Specific components are currently missing and need to be developed to contribute in
the HRS schedule e.g.: heavy-duty nozzles and flexibles, chillers for heavy-duty
purposes, multipurpose refuelling protocols.
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
• Development of new approaches to decrease overall HRS footprint;
• Develop high throughput stations for large scale vehicles (ships, fleets of trains, large
fleets of buses or trucks), including higher than 1,000 kg/day capacity and individual fills
in excess of 200 kg (in less than 20 minutes);
• Reduction in the CAPEX and OPEX of high capacity HRS through integrating innovative
technological components – development work here would focus on how to integrate
those components;
• Facilitate the use of locally produced renewable hydrogen, e.g. by enabling low inlet
pressure and flexible operation for variable RES.
R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
• Standardise and industrialise heavy-duty HRS equipment and components;
• Increase the reliability, safety and availability of heavy-duty HRS equipment and
infrastructure for all road vehicles;
• Deployment of high throughput stations (multi-ton/day) for large scale ships, fleets of
trains or large fleets of buses and trucks;
• Support improved efficiency and minimisation of boil off during hydrogen transfer and
distribution at a HRS based on liquid hydrogen;
• Explore novel business models, for example, on-demand hydrogen refuelling and
compact hydrogen mobile stations.
54Flagship Actions
Funding through flagship actions will help encourage HRS operators to invest in hydrogen
technology by lowering the initial capital cost of HRS and hence helping to create the initial
networks required to deploy hydrogen vehicle technologies.
Synergies
Synergies with CEF must support the roll-out of road HRS. European support is envisaged
alongside Member State support for a large HRS deployment in Europe. See Section 4.1 and
Annex 7 for more details on the synergies.
Hydrogen end uses: Transport applications
Transport is a key area of economic growth in our society, responsible for around 30% of EU
total CO emissions. Most importantly, global transport CO emissions are expected to increase
2 2
in the future in a business as usual scenario, as the technical improvements in the conventional
thermal engines do not seem sufficient to abate emissions from the ever-increasing fleets of
newly registered vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, aircrafts, trains and ships. The European Green
Deal has set the ambition for at least 90% reduction in transport emissions by 2050 to be
consistent with climate neutrality. Hence, there is a need to urgently take measures to
decarbonise the transport sector.
Regulatory aspects will define the speed of adoption of new zero emissions transport means.
The ‘Fit for 55’ package proposes a number of policy measures that promote the use of
hydrogen as a low carbon fuel in the transport sector. Significant focus falls on the road
transport sector, by requiring the reduction in CO2 emissions from cars and light vehicles via
measures such as the introduction of emissions trading in transport (ETS-2), more stringent
CO2 standards, facilitating the development of the necessary hydrogen infrastructure and
promoting higher shares of renewable fuels. There is also considerable focus in maritime
transport, including regulating access of the most polluting ships to EU ports, obliging docked
ships to use shore-side electricity and incentivising the increased uptake of sustainable
alternative fuels, as well as specific targets for shore side electricity supply in TEN-T maritime
and inland ports. Railway and aviation will need to contribute to the CO reduction of transport
2
as well, but especially for aviation the ReFuelEU aviation proposal88 specifies that more
research, effort and time will be needed to make these promising technologies more mature for
wider deployment after 2030.
Regarding transport, there are already some hydrogen applications that have proven to be on
the verge of being ready for market deployment. FC material handling vehicles (HyLIFT
EUROPE and FCLIFT), FC buses (3EMOTION, JIVE and JIVE2) and - to a lesser degree -
FCEV passenger cars (H2ME, H2ME2 and ZEFER), have been successfully developed,
demonstrated and, within the scope of activities of the FCH JUs, have are already been
deployed with limited further subsidies needed.
Nevertheless, these developments are not sufficient to meet the ambitious emission reductions
in transport. We still need to further examine and prove solutions in many sectors such as
heavy-duty vehicles, off-road and industrial vehicles, trains, shipping and aviation. Such
solutions can be based on the transfer of technical knowledge already gained in FC LDV and
FC buses, while cost reductions and higher efficiencies can be achieved by scaling and by
88 Ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport. COM(2021) 561 final.
55process integration, improving the competitiveness of these technologies with a roll down
effect, e.g. by platform approaches of FC modules across sectors.
A number of technology routes still need further improvements, especially in the context of
reducing costs and increasing durability, in order to make them competitive with incumbent
technologies. These include:
• Improvement of main technology building blocks that can be applied across a range of
different transport applications, amongst which fuel cell stacks and hydrogen tanks;
• Adapting fuel cell systems from other vehicles (urban buses / cars) for long distance
coaches and HDV;
• Producing components for rail freight and shunting locomotive applications;
• Adapting FC components to waterborne transport, and developing next generations
based on learnings from first demonstrations;
• Developing tanks and FC technologies specifically adapted for aviation.
It should be also stressed that, especially in the case of hydrogen-based transportation, the
competitiveness of hydrogen technologies is dependent on research and innovation
breakthroughs, on production volumes of vehicles and components and on the price and
availability of hydrogen as a fuel . Therefore, actions aimed at stimulating a broad rollout of FC
vehicles around Europe are equally important to research and innovation actions, in particular
for hard to abate sectors, in order to drive the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the FC vehicles
down. This is particularly true, for example, for the road heavy-duty transport segment where
the. TCO is extremely relevant for final users and ultimately for the market uptake. . Monitoring
of the FC trucks TCO and comparison with battery-powered trucks electrified trucks and others
decarbonisation technologies will be needed. Addressing all of these aspects simultaneously
is necessary to allow for hydrogen transport applications to enter mass market.
Building Blocks
Rationale for Support
In order to fully unlock the potential of hydrogen technologies and introduce them as a
mainstream means of decarbonisation in all transport modes, vehicle prices will need to evolve
towards the prices of vehicles in use today.
This in turn requires a reduction in the cost of the powertrain components – the “technology
building blocks” – the fuel cell stacks, the supporting BoP, which makes up the “fuel cell system”
and the hydrogen storage tank. Cost reduction in these components will be driven by a
combination of technology development and volume of deployment. Embedding the concept of
modularity in the development of components and BoP will also be important in order to reach
mass production efficiently. Modular systems will be adapted to the specific needs of each
transport modes, while avoiding the re-engineering of components and systems hence allowing
the attainment of mass production dynamics despite the low number of units deployed in
different transport modes at early stage.
The strategy for the development of the transport fuel cell system components will continue to
pursue three overarching goals: cost reduction, increased performance and lifetime.
Advancements in this domain will be beneficial to all transport applications regardless of their
current state of the art. Sustainability, recycling and eco-design are also important driving
56principles that will guide the development of components (these aspects are addressed in
more detail in their dedicated chapter).
These efforts will need to be complemented by an adaptation of these “building blocks” to meet
the specific technical needs of transport modes where FC applications have more recently
become a viable option (i.e. marinisation of fuel cells, on-board storage solutions for aviation
etc.).
Within road transport applications, such adaptations will be required for HDV. Due to the fact
that research and innovation activities so far have been mainly dedicated to the development
of components for road applications (passenger’s cars, urban buses, forklifts etc.), the state of
the art of the transport “building blocks” and components for road applications by and large
coincide.
Therefore, even though adaptations of the fuel cell system BoP components for road heavy-
duty applications will require special attention, these will be fewer in number and less
pronounced than the ones required for other transport modes.
Consequently, the strategy for the development of the building blocks and road heavy-duty
applications will be similar in many respects and will be addressed jointly.
At the same time, the building block research area will encompass R&D priorities of interest to
all transport modes. Low TRL priorities such as reduction platinum loading or increased power
density will be pursued with the intention of bringing benefits across all fuel cells applications
in all transport modes.
• Fuel Cell systems
It is clear that increasing production volumes will have a significant impact on cost. According
to the study on Fuel Cell Hydrogen Trucks study, it is expected that an increased annual
production volume of heavy-duty trucks (75.000 units per year in 2030) can lead to a reduction
of the Fuel Cell Module89 cost by around 76%. This cost reduction will be reached more
efficiently if the different building block technologies become modular hence reaching faster
production rates consistent with mass production for different types of vehicles and associated
performance and durability requirements. At the same times Fuel Cell systems may prove to
be effective on operative conditions of other transport modalities, such us maritime, that are
demanding in terms of power and operational conditions.
• Compressed and liquid hydrogen tanks
Volume production and technology developments will also play a similar role for hydrogen
tanks, both gaseous and liquid. The importance of volume is that to develop the components
to a competitive cost level, market deployment programmes to stimulate the market and allow
the technology to mature along the cost curve are crucial. In parallel, technology development
programmes are required to ensure the core technology progresses towards the lower bound
of the cost targets.
State of the Art
These components have been developed to the point where they have the operational reliability
to allow them to be deployed in small series production to mainstream vehicle customers
89 The module includes Fuel cell stack, hydrogen supply of the FC system (e.g. inlet valve),
air compressor, cooling system, power electronics, control unit.
57(thousands of units in the US and Asia90); the main driver for fuel cell technology in Europe is
heavy-duty applications (over 1,600 buses to be deployed). The fuel cell stacks operating in
London’s buses involved in the projects CHIC91 and 3EMOTION92 since 2010 have lasted for
over 35,000 hours, thereby proving their possible longevity in a heavy-duty vehicle at least for
this specific usage. The challenge now is to reduce cost through a combination of increased
production volume and technology development to improve and automate production
techniques, reduce material costs per unit of output (specifically costs of precious metals used
as catalysts in fuel cells and carbon fibre in tanks) and improve designs at stack (e.g. catalyst
layers) and system BoP components level (e.g. air loop). Spill-overs in terms of technology and
upscaling will be considered regarding LDV systems and are expected for other fields of HDV
applications such as rail, marine or aviation (where power ranges are comparable to HDVs).
The FC technology is now validated in numerous European trials and cost reduction is the key
challenge e.g. current FCEV system costs higher than 200 €/kW for passenger cars but need
to fall below 50 €/kW for mass market.
Objectives
Low TRL research activities will drive the development of next generation components, which
is the necessary step in order to further progress towards the full competitiveness of fuel cells
for road applications both in terms of cost and performance.
The main objectives of this technology area will be the following:
1. Improving overall system performance for fuel cell stack technology in terms of power
density, reliability and durability;
2. Reduction or replacement of PGM loadings and development of new materials
advancing the performance of on-board storage technology;
3. Improvements in design, health monitoring and manufacturability of core components
for fuel cell stacks and on-board storage technology;
4. Extending the EU leadership on FC production from automotive to maritime and
aviation, given the high pressure for decarbonisation of these sectors.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
• Fuel cell stack technology:
o Development of new disruptive technologies towards improved areal and
volumetric power density, increased reliability, extended lifetime (validation at
single cell and short stack level) and increased overall system performance;
o Research at material level for PEMFC to reduce or replace PGM loading and
improve the performance of all main stack and fuel cell components
(development of high performance membrane, BPP, GDL etc).

Heavy-duty vehicles
Rationale for Support
Over 75% of the freight transport in the EU is done via road93 and heavy-duty trucks are
responsible for over 25% of the transport CO emissions94. If transport is to contribute to the
2
EU decarbonisation efforts, all transport modes, including heavy-duty, will need to undergo a
93 Energy, transport and environment statistics, Eurostat, 2019
94 Carbon dioxide emissions from Europe’s heavy-duty vehicles, European Environment Agency, 2020
59deep transformation in the coming decade. The rapid uptake of zero emission vehicles is bound
to play a key role. Battery-powered heavy-duty trucks are already on the market, and thanks to
the rapidly developing scale in batteries, coverage of long-haul mission is soon expected.
Hydrogen fuel cells are well suited to applications where long range and/or high payloads are
required due to the relatively high energy density of compressed or liquid hydrogen. In much
the same way as fuel cell buses provide a zero emission solution for public transport operators,
fuel cell trucks are a potential drop-in replacement for diesel trucks as they can be refuelled in
minutes and achieve a range of hundreds of kilometres, while having minimal impact on the
payload.
The heavy-duty vehicles sector is composed of a wide range of segments, with the most
promising for FCs being long-haul heavy-duty trucks for logistics applications (with potential
spill overs to other HDV classes) and refuse collection trucks. In addition, coaches present the
same goals and requirements of long-haul trucks are set/to be pursued and are therefore
covered in this area.
A strong collaboration is envisaged between Clean Hydrogen JU and 2ZERO as both
partnerships will deal with the development and deployment of hydrogen and fuel cells trucks.
An overview of the envisioned distribution of responsibilities between these partnerships is
provided in Annex 7.
State of the Art
Despite a growing number of small-scale FC truck development and demonstration projects
underway in Europe, US, Canada, Korea and China, vehicles have only recently started being
tested and validated in real world operations. A little over 23 projects worldwide led to the
deployment of tens of units95. Among them H2HAUL96, which will develop and demonstrate a
total of 16 new heavy-duty (26–44t) hydrogen fuel cell trucks in real-world commercial
operations, and REVIVE97 tackling the vocational trucks sector. Even though the situation is
rapidly evolving and several announcements98 indicate that a significant ramp up is to be
expected in the near term, the commercialisation of FCH HDV is still at the very early stage;
today there is no FCH HDV original equipment manufacturer (OEM) available on the market
with a commercial offer on a regular basis.
In order to facilitate the commercialisation step, a number of other items, such as the
standardisation and modularity of components, interfaces and development of protocols
allowing faster refuelling operations will need to be developed. Projects such as STASHH99 and
PRHYDE100 are tackling these issues.
Key hurdles to overcome before FC Heavy-Duty Transport (HDT) can become a mainstream
decarbonisation solution include relatively high prices of the vehicles and hydrogen as well as
the deployment of an appropriate refuelling infrastructure. Following the recent adoption of the
EU regulation on the CO standards of Heavy-Duty Vehicles101, an increasing number of
2
European OEMs started investing in FCH HDV solutions and the variety of products on the

Objectives
Building on the development work already underway in this sector, a targeted programme of
support can help to cover the costs of further development activities and attract a growing
number of suppliers. There is a case for funding to support non-recurring engineering costs
and prototyping / development activities in addition to the adaptation of the building blocks for
HD purposes. By 2030 FC suppliers, OEMs, truck operators and infrastructure and hydrogen
providers intend to put on the EU roads up to 100.000 FCH HDV102.
Overall, R&D actions in this area have the following objectives:
1. Reducing the cost of core components such as modules and stacks in order to foster
the competitiveness of FC heavy-duty applications;
2. Improving overall system performance of FC systems in order to improve the availability
and durability and meet the needs of FCH HDV end users;
3. Improvements in design and monitoring procedures of FC systems;
4. Supporting and accelerating the wide roll out of FC HDVs.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
• Improvement or development of strategic BoP components and design of HDV systems
for low cost and scaled-up manufacturing;
• Development of disruptive concepts towards improved volumetric and gravimetric
power and energy density and increased durability of HDV systems;
• Improved and lower cost hydrogen on-board storage (gaseous and liquid) solutions.
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
• Establishing FC HDV specifications required to meet users’ needs and regulation
constraints for a range of truck sizes, duty cycles and auxiliary units (e.g., refrigerated
food transport) power demand.
• Modelling, optimisation and life cycle cost analysis tools are essential to suitably
address optimal HDV and coaches powertrain design and energy management taking
into account a hybridisation with a battery pack, as well as FC-related recycling
potential;

(https://www.fch.europa.eu/publications/study-fuel-cells-hydrogen-trucks)
61• Optimisation of the HDV system to different use cases targeting improved performance
and durability (e.g. hybridised powertrains, range extender, advanced tools and
methods for improving control and strategies);
• Further development of Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) concepts capable of meeting high
power demand of vocational heavy-duty applications (e.g. construction trucks, off-road
vehicles).
R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
Demonstrations should focus on:
• Validating the performance of the technology in a range of real-world operations,
specifically KPIs such as availability, lifetime, efficiency and total cost of ownership;
• Preparing the market for wider roll-out, e.g. by training technicians to maintain hydrogen
components of the vehicles, etc;
• Collecting and analysing empirical evidence on performance (technical and
commercial) of vehicles and associated refuelling infrastructure
• Exploiting the promising synergies between hydrogen-based renewable distributed
energy systems and transport sector;
• Ensuring the most promising range of truck types are tested; (i.e. different weight
classes, niches such as refuse trucks);Ensure fully addressing the safety issues
associated to the significant amount of on-board stored pressurised hydrogen.
Flagship Actions
With a growing need to decarbonise all areas of the transport sector, and a high focus on air
quality issues in cities arising from traffic emissions, the demand for zero emission vehicles in
all segments is anticipated to continue to grow over the next decade. The development and
demonstration activities outlined above will lay the foundations for a larger scale FC HDV roll-
out programme in the mid 2020’s.
Key priorities in the market activation phase include developing and implementing innovative
commercial models to manage risk appropriately and supply chain development to ensure that
the vehicles are fully supported throughout their operational lives. Supporting such priorities
entails meeting customer expectations in terms of FC system reliability and driving range.
Synergies
Potential synergies have been identified with the Towards Zero Emission Road Transport
partnership (2ZERO) on various areas. See Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the
synergies. Furthermore the deployment of FC HDV will need to be developed in parallel to the
deployment of an increasing number of HRS that will need to support such fleet.
Waterborne applications
Rationale for Support
To put the fight against global climate change at the forefront, the International Maritime
Organisation (IMO) adopted an initial GHG reduction strategy in 2018.103 The strategy
envisages that a revised strategy will be adopted in 2023. With projected growth of the shipping
103 https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Pages/06GHGinitialstrategy.aspx
62industry, the IMO estimated that the overall GHG contribution from shipping could double in a
business-as-usual scenario by 2050. The IMO set a target to reduce CO emissions by at least
2
50% in 2050. As ships are generally in service for 15 years or more (sea-going ship and 40
years for some inland vessels), the maritime industry faces an enormous task to achieve this
goal.
At European scale, achieving the EU objective of climate neutrality by 2050 will also require
unparalleled innovations in shipping, including the supply and use of sustainable climate neutral
marine fuels as well as the associated port, storage and bunkering infrastructures. Already
today, Europe’s long-standing leadership in the maritime sector is coming under pressure. The
EU’s share of worldwide shipbuilding production is in decline. By 2017, over 90% of shipbuilding
activity occurred in China, the Republic of Korea and Japan104. Much of this activity relates to
lower-end maritime technologies, leaving European shipbuilders ‘free’ to focus on more
sophisticated, higher added value, vessels and maritime equipment, where Europe remains a
global leader for the time being.
Hydrogen and its derivatives fuels, such as ammonia, together with fuel cells are an important
piece of the puzzle. Assuming an adequate supply, hydrogen and its derivative fuels can
provide potential zero GHG emissions and the possibility of a rapid decrease of the average
GHG emissions for shipping.
Commercial cargo shipping, in particular intercontinental services account for the vast majority
of the sector’s GHG emissions, consequently it will be important that solutions are scalable to
these applications. For example short sea shipping typically carries several hundred tons of
fuel oil and the fuel requirements for intercontinental services are around ten times larger.
One of the most important factors to decarbonise shipping is the availability of climate neutral
fuels in ports. The Clean Hydrogen JU will support actions on the provision of zero-carbon fuels
(hydrogen and its derivatives), shore based infrastructures in addition to adequately sized
technology modules such as high power multi MW fuel cells and storage technologies
applications for ships.
State of the Art
• Fuel Cells for ships
Fuel cells and hydrogen have been demonstrated in e.g. submarines, small inland and coastal
vessels and auxiliary power for supply vessels, proving the viability of the technology at small
scale. In addition, several demonstration projects on small ferries are under execution. A few
larger cargo ship projects have recently been funded, but commercial scale vessels are
generally at the design study stage and a range of fuels and fuel cell types are currently being
tested. Multi fuel combustion engines which are capable of operating with a variety of gaseous
and liquid fuels are already on or are close to the market. The European hydrogen and fuel cell
supply chain is scaling up its interest in waterborne transport, with formal co-operations and
joint ventures between FC manufacturers and some maritime power train providers and system
integrators.
Demonstration projects are underway to highlight the viability of hydrogen to power ships using
FCs and modified combustion engines. For certain use types (inland and small near coastal)
and possibly cruise ships, there is recognition that FCs, using hydrogen are a promising zero-

63emission option. Several demonstration projects have already been launched in Europe:
1. “Hydra” LH ferry105 at Hjelmeland, Norway. A RoPax LH PEMFC ferry now being built
2 2
(operational September 2021) and operated by NORLED;
2. LH Pilot-E.106 Very large-scale grant, delivered in tranches, with the aim to build LH

infrastructure for maritime transport in Norway. This includes production of LH ;

3. HySeasIII (H2020).107 HySeas III’s aim is to deliver a sea-going vehicle and passenger
ferry fuelled with hydrogen produced from renewable energy;
4. HySHIP (FCH JU), development and validation of a 3 MW fuel cell liquid hydrogen ship,
used in a hydrogen bunkering and supply chain;
5. ShipFC (FCH JU),108 “Scaling up and demonstration of a multi-MW Fuel Cell system for
shipping”. It plans to retrofit and operate a ship with a 2 MW SOFC ammonia power
system;
6. Flagships (FCH JU).109 In Flagships there are two demonstrators, where one passenger
ferry is operated by Norled (Norway) and the other a fluvial barge operated by CFT
(France);
7. e-SHyIPS (FCH JU), on pre-normative research on hydrogen-based fuels solutions for
passenger ships.
Whilst to date, the scale of demonstrations remains significantly below to what is required for a
fuel cell to become the primary power source within an intercontinental ship or cruise ship,
several design projects are ongoing to test the applicability of integrating FCs within this type
of vessels. However, due to the diversity of waterborne transport, e.g., magnitude of energy
storage and power required for various user cases, the implications for ship design, integration,
fuel storage and regulation, no consensus on the optimal strategy for fuel and propulsion
technology has been reached.
• Hydrogen in ports
Fuel availability and corresponding port facilities are essential in the operations of vessels.
Dedicated bunker vessels may supply new fuel to ships in ports, at anchor or in ship-to-ship
modes. With the transition to alternative fuels, new bunker vessels have to be developed, and
new bunkering infrastructure is needed alongside the European rivers and coasts. The
bunkering technology has to be adapted to hydrogen both in gaseous and liquid forms as well
as hydrogen derivatives and requires specialised technologies and safety procedures. In
addition, with the electrification of vessels, the need arises for high-power charging facilities in
areas with grid limitations, including stationary FC may be well suited for cold ironing, using
hydrogen FC to supply electricity for operating the vessel while at quay.
Studies and pilot projects have already been launched in Europe and some companies have
announced prototypes:

port machinery of various types for the logistics of containers in port terminals;
3. Study on hydrogen ports and industrial coastal areas (FCH JU), 2021, the study will

Objectives
Development work will focus on improving access to the market for hydrogen, its derivatives
and FCs, initially on smaller vessels. It will develop the necessary safety standards,
components and fuelling systems required for smaller and subsequently for larger ship types.
This will strengthen and consolidate the European maritime hydrogen value chain and set the
foundation for large scale deployment.
The shipping sector involves a wide range of use cases, with both the autonomy and power
requirements of small vessels and large ships differing by three orders of magnitude. This
highlights the importance of defining different strategies for zero emission propulsion for each
vessel type:
1. For inland waterways and short-sea shipping, hydrogen and its derivatives can become
an alternative low emission GHG neutral fuel; For short sea ships, fuel requirements
would be equivalent to several hundred tons of fuel oil and the developed safety
standards, IMO rules and ship integration would also be largely applicable to much
larger ships. In the 5 to 10 MW range, fuel cell power needs would provide a stepping
stone towards deep sea shipping services;
2. Intercontinental deep-sea shipping accounts for more than two thirds of waterborne
GHG emissions. Compared to short sea shipping, powers are 2 to 3 times larger, fuel
capacity 10 times greater with autonomy of around one month. Considering this and the
implications for global fuel supply, solutions will build upon those developed for short
sea shipping as well as ensuring the feasibility of providing adequate fuel, storage and
bunkering infrastructure;
3. For ports, the building of infrastructure to refuel hydrogen and its derivatives, together
with development of the necessary safety and standards for hydrogen bunkering at a
scale relevant for commercial shipping, and the supply of electricity at shore with
stationary FC.
FC and hydrogen technologies can provide a commercially viable option for zero-emission
waterborne transport in certain use cases. For small ships, hydrogen, its derivatives and fuel
cells have the potential to become the mainstream option for zero emission ships. For larger
vessels selecting FCs can be a preferred zero emission propulsion solution, using a range of
fuel types. In order for that to happen, future development work will focus on improving access
to the market for hydrogen, including its derivatives, scaling up the power, efficiency and
operational performance of FC designs towards commercially relevant applications, initially for
smaller vessels and advancing the components and fuelling systems required so that they are
relevant for all short sea vessels and other ship types.
65Establishment of a distribution and bunkering network in ports and along inland waterways
across Europe is key for a large-scale roll-out of hydrogen to provide a feasible service to both
maritime shipping and inland navigation.
Safe, flexible bunkering solutions for hydrogen for different waterborne transport segments, will
therefore have to be realised to facilitate its increased use.
The definition and development of proper and consistent rules, regulations and procedures will
support the introduction of hydrogen as a maritime fuel in ports in the safest way possible for
the infrastructure, the environment and the surrounding population. Furthermore, technical
standards will be developed for transferring to ship, or recharging ships and the directly related
facilities (i.e., nozzles and hoses) to ensure that ships can be serviced throughout Europe.
In summary, R&D actions in this area have the following objectives:
1. Scaling up the power, efficiency and operational performance of FC designs towards
commercially relevant applications;
2. Reducing the CAPEX and OPEX of PEMFC or SOFC systems for maritime applications;
3. Improving overall system performance for FC and stacks, especially in terms of power
density, bunkering rate and operational flexibility;
4. Improvements in ship design and safety procedures, both for ships and ports bunker
terminals;
5. Supporting the wide roll out of FC ships, by providing adequate fuel, storage and
bunkering infrastructure and developing new solutions for ships based on hydrogen and
its derivative fuels.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
• New low cost, scalable technologies with increased power density of FC stacks and
BoP. This will involve LT and HT PEM fuel cells, as well as SOFC systems capable of
using a range of fuels and achieving a high overall (well-to-wake) efficiency;
• Improvement of on-board storage solution for hydrogen, integrated below the vessel
deck and also swappable fuel tank containers on deck;
• Improvement of on-board reforming of hydrogen carriers, if needed.
• Enabling deployment in shipping of hydrogen and ammonia by ensuring safety
underpinned by the necessary onshore norms and regulations (protocols and
standards).
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
• Integration and design activities for using different combinations of fuel cells for short
sea ships (or modified internal combustion engines), a novel BoP configurations and
different hydrogen carriers and possible reforming options to increase operational
flexibility and FC durability;
• Enabling the safe, efficient on-board storage and integration within short sea ships of
large quantities of hydrogen and its derivatives fuels;
66• Enabling the full integration of fuel cells in short sea ship designs;
• Develop novel storage and bunkering solutions for very large volumes of energy in
ports, either as pure hydrogen (Compressed hydrogen gas - CGH - or LH ) or as
2 2
hydrogen carriers;
• Supply/bunkering of large quantities of hydrogen both liquid and gaseous, and other
hydrogen carriers in ports environment.
R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
Further demonstrations in the post-2020 period should focus on:
• Strengthening and consolidating the European maritime value chain by developing and
deploying fuel cells and hydrogen-based fuel storage solutions into new and existing
vessels and installing the associated high capacity refuelling infrastructure into ports;
• Validation of the technical readiness of novel fuel cells and to determine the preferred
fuel option for large vessels;
Integration of fuel cells for large sea-going ships and applicable hydrogen carriers will be
developed in the Zero Emission Waterborne Transport partnership (ZEWT) and synergies
should be explored accordingly.
Flagship Actions
Ports are coastal hubs where industries and transports coexist. The local demand for hydrogen
is thus the sum of the needs for the port operations, the heavy industries and the heavy-duty
transport in the vicinity. For the largest ports, it represents quantities of hydrogen currently not
available at a single location.
The development and demonstration activities outlined above will lay the foundations for a
larger scale FC shipping in the early 2020’s, creating the scale required for this sector.
Key priorities in the market activation phase include developing and implementing innovative
commercial models to manage risk appropriately and hydrogen supply chain development to
ensure that the ships are fully supported throughout their operational lives. Due to their trading
and economic importance, ports are at the heart of future hydrogen valleys. Such valleys are
ecosystems / clusters with dense concentration of users of hydrogen for energy, transport and
industrial purposes. These valleys are the ideal set-ups to initiate a renewable hydrogen
transition. Indeed, stakeholders of the valleys can more easily under a common goal, set clear
milestones, reach economies of scale, share investment risks and ultimately accelerate the
deployment of a hydrogen infrastructure, supply and use.
Synergies
Potential synergies have been identified with ZEWT and P4P (as regards industrial hubs near
ports area). See Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the synergies, as well as a
potential distribution of responsibilities between the JU and ZEWT.
Rail applications
Rationale for Support
The majority of trains operating today are either diesel powered or electrified via overhead
lines. Whilst electrification will deliver emissions equal to the average electricity mix at the point
67of use (unless otherwise certified), overhead lines of traditional electric locomotives are
expensive and logistically complex (so limited to higher capacity lines). Battery electric
propulsion may find applications for passenger trains operating over shorter distances, but
hydrogen offers longer range and several advantages over electric pantograph locomotives
utilising overhead lines , e.g., freedom of the locomotives to roam, relatively little infrastructure
required and the option to secure a zero-carbon fuel supply.
Hydrogen is a key enabling technology for decarbonising rail transport as it can provide the
most cost-effective solution for certain lines that are still operated with diesel trains, by
revamping diesel units or replacing existing trains with new hydrogen-powered ones. As well
as regional passenger trains, FC trains could provide viable zero emission options for freight
trains and shunting locomotives. The technology requires further development, adaptation,
optimisation and integration of flexible FC components and systems into trains, and market
deployment support to increase volumes and reduce costs. There is also considerable effort
required around regulation for the use of hydrogen on railways.
A study of Shif2Rail and FCH 2 JUs110 pointed out a good potential for fuel cells in the railway
environment for the replacement of diesel rolling stock. Some of the cases evaluated already
show a positive TCO for fuel cells, while in others this technology is recognised as the most
adequate zero-emission alternative.
State of the Art
Europe has adopted a leading position on the integration and assembly of FC trains thanks to
the innovative work from Alstom and Siemens. Whilst there is passenger train demonstration
activity in Asia and Canada, it appears that Europe has the lead in this area especially with
regards to the integration of the fuel cell drivetrain, the provision of large-scale infrastructure
and regulation to allow the use of hydrogen on the railways.
Three European companies are developing new hydrogen fuelled fuel cell trains. Use cases
based on this technology indicate that TCO be within 5-20% more of conventional options
(depending on cost of hydrogen):
1. The Alstom iLint FC train111 has a 400 kW FC, and a max range of 1,000 km (350 bar
hydrogen, 260 kg stored on board) and can accommodate up to 300 passengers.
Capital costs are around €5.5 million (excluding hydrogen infrastructure). It has been
approved for commercial operations in Germany, and 2 prototype trains have been in
operation since 2018 with passenger service. In Germany, 41 trains have been ordered
for delivery in 2021/2022, and letters of intent for a total of 60 trains have been signed;
14 trains have been ordered in France for delivery from 2023.
2. Siemens are also working on a fuel cell version of their Mireo train112, and there are
plans to convert freight locomotives to use hydrogen (e.g., Latvian Railways). In the UK
a number of train operators are exploring conversion of existing rolling stock to use
hydrogen (e.g., Eversholt with Alstom);
3. The hydrogen-powered FLIRT H2 train113 from Stadler is planned to be introduced in

682024. The train is expected to have seating space for 108 passengers and in addition
standing room, with a maximum speed of up to 130 km/h. A first contract has been
signed to supply a hydrogen-powered train to run in the United States.
4. The project FCH2RAIL (FCH JU),114 “Extending the use cases for FC trains through
innovative designs and streamlined administrative framework”, is going a step further
by addressing: (a) bi-mode solutions for efficient operation on partially electrified lines;
(b) transformation and retrofitting of existing trains to hydrogen clean propulsion and;
(c) cross-border certification of hydrogen trains. An on-track demonstrator on a
CAF/Renfe Train with Toyota Motor Europe fuel cells will be available by 2023.
Objectives
The areas singled out for support have been selected with the end goal in sight of enabling
hydrogen to be recognised as the leading option for trains on non-electrified routes or partially
electrified routes, with 1 in 5 trains sold for non-electrified railways are powered by hydrogen110.
Overall, R&D actions in this area have the following objectives:
1. Reducing the cost of stacks;
2. Improving reliability and durability at stack and FC system;
3. Improving power output while reducing weight and dimension of the module;
4. Improvements in train design and safety procedures;
5. Supporting the roll out of FC trains, by providing the viability of the FCH solution in the
train transport segment.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
Due to the FC trains already achieving a high TRL (6), no early phase development projects
will be funded.
R&D Priorities - Development Research Actions
• Designing new concepts for on board bulk hydrogen storage e.g., cryo-compressed
hydrogen or liquid storage;
• Developing novel hybrid systems to optimise component sizing – Fuel cell specific train
architecture. To date train architecture has been based on retrofit of existing
components – there is space to optimise (e.g., space for hydrogen storage, use of waste
heat) in purpose-built designs;
• Developing new optimised bi-mode system architectures integrating FC systems with
new generation power electronics and battery technology to achieve balanced solutions
suitable for efficient partially electrified operation.
• Ensuring performance of very high capacity HRS (i.e. hydrogen infrastructure) can meet
railway technical, operational and safety specific constraints, in order to optimise
production & distribution costs.
114 https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101006633
69R&D Priorities - Demonstration Actions
• Ensure early demonstration of trains of different types including local freight and
shunting locomotives;
• Validate the commercial and environmental performance of the trains (and hence the
claim of being the lowest cost zero emission option for non-electrified routes);
• Test very high capacity refuelling stations adapted to the specificities of rail applications.
• Projects could also help to develop maintenance and support strategies for the vehicles
and provide a basis to develop regulations to enable FC trains and hydrogen use across
Europe.
Flagship Actions
Early deployment of around 100 trains across Europe to enable OEMs to begin standardised
production and establish the technology as a mainstream option for Europe’s train specifiers.
Initial financial aid will help increase the scale of the technology across Europe as well as
support the integration of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure across the continent.
Synergies
Possible synergies should be examined with the Europe's Rail partnership, as well as other
funding sources – most notably CEF transport and CEF transport blending facilities for mass
deployment of FC trains above and the required hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. See Section
4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the synergies.
Aeronautic applications
Rationale for Support
By 2030, FCs are expected to be increasingly used for auxiliary power units & ground power
units but also propulsion in civil aircraft. A selection of FC aviation models will achieve full
certification and will be in real-world operation, including small passenger planes (up to 50
seats). The first demonstration (ground, in-flight) of a LH propulsion aircraft (fuel cell / turbine)
2
is expected by 2024115.
The target of net zero carbon of aviation in 2050 will be reached only by a combination of all
available levers, such as technology, air traffic management, but also sustainable alternative
fuels. Hydrogen presents a strong potential used in fuel cells or in dedicated turbines. However,
key technologies remain to be developed and demonstrated within the framework of the Clean
Hydrogen and Clean Aviation partnerships.
High power FCs (1.5 MW) are yet to be developed in order to address the propulsion of small,
Regional and Short-Medium Range (RSMR) commercial aircrafts, as well as key technologies
such as tailored liquid hydrogen tanks and fuel systems. Low NO emitting hydrogen
x
combustion turbines are also needed for larger aircrafts.
Aeronautics is one of the EU’s key high-tech sectors on the global market. With world leading
aircraft companies (i.e., AIRBUS, SAFRAN, Rolls-Royce and research institutes such as DLR)
and expertise in fuel cell technologies, Europe could play a vital role in driving the
transformation of aviation to reduce emissions. The potential economic gains of this area are
large - in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market alone, the EU could have a market share
115 https://heaven-fch-project.eu/
70of approximately €1.2 billion per annum by 2025. In the civil aviation, the global market is
estimated to exceed 38 000 airplanes by 2034.
State of the Art
• Propulsive application
The use of FC in aviation applications is already being tested in demonstration projects across
different use cases. However, due to the unique challenges posed by aviation (i.e., extremely
large energy demands) projects to date focus on light, small-scale UAVs (SUAV, HYPPER)
and passenger airplanes (up to 5 passengers). For example, the Hy4116 platform of DLR
involved, among others in the FCH JU project HEAVEN is the world’s first four-seat passenger
aircraft powered by FC technology, while ZeroAvia117 performed their first test flight of a six-
sitter plane in September 2020. Demonstration projects are progressively targeting larger
applications, yet very few demonstrations of hydrogen for propulsion (FC and turbine) have
been performed.
In September 2020, AIRBUS announced118 three game-changing concepts for future
commercial passenger aircraft using hydrogen as the primary energy supply:
1. Turboprop - a Regional aircraft concept with 1000 nautic miles mission range and
around 100 passengers capacity;
2. Turbofan - a RSMR aircraft concept with 2000 nautic miles mission range and around
200 passengers capacity;
3. Blended-Wing Body - a more scalable concept allowing more space for hydrogen and
passengers;
AIRBUS’ ambition is to develop these three concepts and deliver the first hydrogen-powered
commercial aircraft with entry-into-service by 2035.
In September 2020, Universal Hydrogen Co. and Plug Power Inc. announced119 working
together to retrofit a regional airplane with hydrogen fuel cells to power its two propellers.
Together these companies aim to have a plane ready and government-certified to fly by 2024.
• Non-propulsive application
Hydrogen technology has been developed for non-propulsive aviation applications. For
example, APUs have been tested through the HYCARUS120 project (2013-2018). Supported by
the FCH JU, this project aimed to develop a Generic Fuel Cell System for use as auxiliary
power on larger commercial aircrafts and business jets. Over time, as this technology is
advanced and matured, FC applications will be deployed on progressively larger and heavier
aircrafts and become operable in real-world service.

Synergies
A strong collaboration is envisaged between Clean Hydrogen JU and Clean Aviation
partnership. See Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the synergies.
Hydrogen end uses: Clean heat and power
Hydrogen offers a unique chance to decarbonise the power generation and heating sectors
reliably and independently from weather or seasonal conditions. In its quality as a dispatchable
energy carrier, it can easily cope with high peak demands, and is available any time during the
year and day to support grid balancing actions based on hydrogen storage/use strategies in
local and regional networks. It is also complementary to, and offering a diversification option,
from the direct electrification of the heating sector. Energy conversion in combined heat and
power generators do not only cover the thermal needs whenever required, but also reduces the
load on the electrical side when demand is usually highest, avoiding grid congestion at the
distribution level and allowing to optimise overall costs of the energy system.
The overall goal of this pillar is to support European supply chain actors to develop a portfolio
of solutions providing clean, renewable and flexible heat and power generation for all end users’
needs and across all system sizes; from domestic systems all the way to large-scale power
generation plants. Preferential support will be for solutions running on 100% hydrogen.
However, there is still room to support solutions running on a hydrogen mixture in the gas grid
(up to 20% within the context of the activities included in this support area) during the transition
73phase122. For gas turbines, in order to enable a smooth transition and assure backward
compatibility with conventional fuels during the transition, support for actions running with
different hydrogen admixtures are likely to be required to facilitate the development process
and to achieve the final goal of 100% hydrogen turbines.
To reach the overall goal of this pillar, support will be provided for the following activity areas:
1. Stationary fuel cells;
2. Gas turbines, boilers and burners.
Fuel cells generate power and heat efficiently and in a silent and clean manner. If hydrogen is
generated from renewable energy sources, then the fuel cells proposition is unique, as they are
the only technology able to silently generate clean energy with zero emissions. Going up to the
MWe scale, fuel cells generate power with the highest efficiencies offering a clean and silent
alternative to conventional solutions such as combustion engines.
As power systems start to be dominated by variable renewable energy sources, notably wind
and solar, meeting fluctuating demand requires the availability of additional and responsive
capacity. Gas turbines fed with low-carbon hydrogen can offer a decarbonised solution for the
provision of a stable energy supply at the transmission level. Adaptation of existing gas turbines
to hydrogen will reduce the overall costs of the energy transition, as investments in new
dedicated assets can be postponed. This would also allow to extend the use of the 180 GWe
gas turbine power generation123,124 currently available in Europe125.
For the provision of high temperature heat for industry, the use of low-carbon hydrogen in
burners and boilers appears to be better placed than other low carbon and renewable solutions.
122 According to the “Hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe”, the blending of hydrogen in the
natural gas network at a limited percentage may enable decentralised renewable hydrogen production
in local networks in a transitional phase.

For gas turbines and SOFCs values provided are for natural gas. For PEMFC values provided are for hydrogen.
Support in this pillar will focus on fuel cell solutions up to the 10 MWe scale and gas turbines
only for larger systems, possibly for applications above 50 MWe. This range is only indicative,
though support in the range of tens of MWe and up to the 50 MWe scale could be provided
following a technology neutral approach, where either 100% hydrogen fuel cells or turbines or
a combination of both could be favoured. For indicative purposes and to support the narrative
included in this section the figure above includes State of the Art (SoA) efficiencies and NO
x
emissions for fuel cell and gas turbines with or without combined cycles for a range of power
capacities.
Stationary Fuel Cells
Rationale for support
Fuel cells unique proposition, relative to other technologies, resides in that they are the only
technology driven by hydrogen that is able to silently generate clean energy with zero
emissions. This positions fuel cells as a key technology to decarbonise a number of end user
demands across a large range of sizes. Power production is common to all applications.
Depending on the specific application, additional value is provided in different forms.
126 The net efficiency is the ratio between the net electrical power generated and the chemical energy
flow rate.
75• Fuel cells (hydrogen admixtures in natural gas or 100% hydrogen driven) for Combined
Heat and Power (CHP) applications – fuel cells can provide heat for buildings127 (directly
or via district heating networks) as well as electricity at high efficiency. They can also
provide heat and power to the service and industrial sectors; when coupled to thermal
storage they can offer additional flexibility to the system.
• Back-up power, gen-sets and off-grid power production (typically hydrogen, but also
methanol and ammonia fuelled for longer term back-up) – because of fast response
times and low maintenance needs compared to diesel systems, fuel cells are an ideal
component of back-up and temporary (portable) power systems. Fuel cells can also be
used as main power sources for off-grid locations.
• Prime power (hydrogen admixtures in natural gas or 100% hydrogen driven) – fuel cells
can also be used as prime power or primary power providers. In Europe there have
been limited prime power applications, but in the US and Asia, applications such as
data centres and large corporate campuses have seen significant uptake.
More advanced reversible fuel cell concepts can provide flexibility to the energy system and
provide a means to link different energy sectors, e.g. gas and electricity grid but also heating
networks, if by-product heat from the electrochemical conversion can be recovered and put to
use.
The focus of the Clean Hydrogen JU will be on hydrogen driven fuel cells. Large-scale
deployment projects for residential micro-CHP applications are not foreseen as they were
already covered in the FCH 2 JU.
State of the Art
Stationary applications of fuel cells range from a few hundred Watts all the way to multi-MW
systems. In Europe, the most mature application is micro combined heat and power, micro-
CHP (from 0.5 kWe to 5 kWe), which is typically used to provide heat and power for domestic
applications and small businesses. In Europe, most installed units are between 0.7 kWe and 2
kWe. Both PEMFC and SOFC are used, though SOFC units are a more common offering in
Europe, and increasingly so globally.
Deployment volumes in Europe are still low compared to other regions of the world. The
European domestic market is developing, helped by support programmes such as the
FCH 2 JU’s Ene.field128 and PACE129 projects, and the German KFW433 grant scheme (for
systems 0.25-5 kWe). To date Europe has seen systems installed in the order of tens of
thousands, in contrast to installations of more than 300,000 in Japan alone. There are no other
substantial markets for micro-CHP systems anywhere else in the world.
Support under the FCH 2 JU managed to create a track record of micro-CHP installations,
demonstrating the performance and market readiness of these technologies. Power efficiencies
as high as 60% and total efficiencies exceeding 90% have been achieved. Availability of 99%
over sustained periods have been shown and some manufacturers claim stack durability of 10
years and system lifetimes of 15 years. In addition, the CAPEX of European systems has been
reduced (below 10,000 €/kWe) thanks to a combination of research and first industrial

gas emissions. Source: DG ENER, 2020.

76deployment. There is room to decrease costs further and incremental additional work is needed
to allow operation under 0-100% hydrogen admixtures.
Fuel cells for cogeneration can also be used to supply the needs of commercial buildings and
the service sector, also in combination with thermal storage, and to be the heat source for
district heating networks. These applications typically range between 5 - 500 kWe system
capacity. Such a market is considered small, both globally and for Europe. Still a number of
actors in Europe have started to demonstrate solutions in real installations, like FCH JU projects
DEMOSOFC130 and ComSos131. Costs of Europe’s fuel cell systems for these applications still
remain high.
In recent years, Europe has developed and trialled reversible fuel cell systems using solid oxide
cells. The fuel cell uses natural gas to generate heat and power (and hydrogen if operated in
poly-generation mode) and in reversible operation they can generate hydrogen via electrolysis.
These concepts are now being tested in the sub 100 kWe scale with promising results, although
sustained efforts are required on the way to commercialisation.
Larger size cogeneration applications with fuel cells are possible (500 kWe and over). This
market in Europe is still underdeveloped although several European actors offer MWe scale
fuel cells. To date, only a few demonstrations have taken place, including FCH JU projects
DEMCOPEM2MW132 and CLEARGENDMEMO133 using the first generation of MWe scale
systems, mainly in overseas markets with more favourable market conditions. The next
generation systems, are currently being developed for reduced costs and dynamic operation.
Conventional back-up, portable and off-grid power solutions use fossil fuel based engine
generators and are sometimes combined with batteries to provide the required reliability of
service. Fuel cells offer a clean and higher efficiency alternative, require less maintenance,
provide extended runtimes relative to batteries and are better placed to operate under harsh
outdoor environments. Nevertheless, Europe’s market in these sectors needs further
development. This situation differs largely from the rest of the world where, for instance in the
US, most fuel cells for stationary application are used as back-up power supply to reinforce the
unreliable power grid.
Fuel cells can also be used as prime power solutions for continuous on-site power generation
instead of grid electricity. These applications in Europe have seen limited activity, though in the
US and Asia, an increasing number of fuel cells serve as the primary power source for data
centres and large corporate campuses, where the provision of reliable power supply is critical.
Objectives
Europe’s has an objective for climate neutrality in 2050. This means that a large penetration of
variable renewable power generation as well as an increased presence of renewable gases in
the years to come and until 2050. Support in this area should therefore be oriented to develop
solutions that are compatible with, and come in support of, this scenario.
In terms of ambition, the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda of the Industry and
Research (SRIA-HE/HER) set the vision to deploy over 2.5 GWe of stationary fuel cells by
2030. In addition, the expectations are for numerous European manufacturers producing 500

77MW sales/year by the end of 2030. In order to facilitate such large uptake of stationary fuel
cells the objectives of the Clean Hydrogen JU it will be important to improve the techno-
economic performance of fuel cells for stationary applications in order to increase the
penetration in the market of such solutions. To achieve this the objectives of this pillar are set
as follows:
1. Reducing CAPEX and TCO of stationary fuel cells of all sizes and end use applications;
2. Prepare and demonstrate the next generation of fuel cells for stationary applications
able to run under 100% H and other H -rich fuels whilst keeping high performance;
2 2
3. Improve flexibility of systems in operation in particular with reversible fuel cells and
integration with thermal storage;
4. Reducing use of critical raw materials and recycling them for further usage;
5. Support development of processes suitable for mass manufacturing.
In order to achieve the above objectives and building on the current SoA, the focus of the
support under this activity area is detailed below.
Support to micro-CHP systems shall focus on research activities aiming to prepare the next
generation of fuel cell micro-CHP systems. The ultimately objective is to reduce CAPEX and
TCO to competitive levels and to validate the performance of units running on 100% hydrogen.
Reversible fuel cell concepts at this small scale could be considered if sufficient demand and a
positive business case can be identified, empowering end-users.
For commercial buildings and service sector applications, cost reduction through new stack
designs and improved components in order to improve the flexibility in operation should be
prioritised. Support is foreseen for the demonstration of small and medium reversible fuel cell
concepts. Those pave the way to deploy distributed commercial systems capable of linking
electricity and gas grids at medium and low voltage levels, and potentially district heating
networks using the by-product heat produced. Systems running on 0-20% hydrogen volume in
the gas grid or using pure hydrogen are the focus of this support area. Larger reversible
systems (above 1 MW in electrolyser mode) fall under the hydrogen production activity area.
For larger FC applications the focus is on systems running on 100% hydrogen, e.g. waste
hydrogen from industrial processes or hydrogen grids. Synergies with the district heating sector
are to be explored with the view to provide heat using fuel cells fed with 100% hydrogen.
Research is needed to decrease the costs of systems further and to demonstrate the next
generation for these large-scale applications. Selected demonstrations in real installations to
prove the technology in actual long-term operation and to showcase new business models are
likely to be needed.
Fuel cells operating in cogeneration mode should be given priority. However, power-only
solutions operating as prime power can make sense, especially when using high temperature
fuel cells with power efficiencies comparable to, or better then, the most efficient large-scale
power generation plants (e.g. Combined Cycle Gas Turbines – CCGT); in particular, at the local
grid level and in applications where it is not possible to put the by-product heat to use. This is
increasingly the case with more abundant hydrogen availability providing high reliability versus
RES for critical infrastructure such as data centres.
Support is also envisaged for back-up, portable and off-grid power fuel cell solutions, especially
in remote and isolated locations and where there is a premium on reliable and clean power,
78and/or where pollutants and noise in urban and low emission zones are critical. Actions in this
area could support units running directly on hydrogen or using other hydrogen rich fuels of the
likes of ammonia or liquid organic hydrogen carriers, and is open to all type of fuel cells. Whilst
the focus is likely to be on research, there is room in the Clean Hydrogen JU to support selected
demos for proving adequate uptime and availabilities.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities – Early Stage Research Actions
• Research into new cell materials, stack technologies, components and manufacturing
processes for stationary fuel cell systems to improve system flexibility, durability and
increase robustness of components under flexible operation;
• Research to develop advanced reversible cell concepts, based on both oxide ion and
ceramic proton conductors.
R&D Priorities – Development Research Actions
• Support to drive standardisation and cost reductions in the balance of plant components
and in-operation processes such as predictive maintenance and development of fuel
cell systems integrated with (smart) power grids, off-grid and decentralised renewable
energy sources;
• Innovative manufacturing methods suitable for mass-production and enabling cost
reductions;
• Develop a commercial/industrial scale CHP unit and/or prime power units from
European suppliers (100 kWe – 1 Mwe) to demonstrate this;
• For industrial heat and power development work on prototypes for the smart
cogeneration of industrial heat and electricity by FC CHP at 1, 10 and 100 MW scales;
• Integration work on reversible cell concepts, to improve the round-trip efficiency to
above 50% and to develop concepts at a range of scales.
R&D Priorities – Demonstration Actions
• Hydrogen ready and cost effective micro-CHP systems;
• Demonstrate the deployment of the next generation of commercial/industrial scale fuel
cell CHP and/or prime power units from European suppliers (50 kW to several Mwe);
• For industrial heat and power: demonstration projects on cogeneration of industrial heat
and electricity with fuel cells selected industrial environment, e.g. food, biotech;
• Demonstrate reversible cell concepts at sites with renewable generation and/or
biogas/syngas inputs;
• Automated production, quality assurance tools and techniques during production and
End-of-Line testing.
Flagship Actions
Flagship support would be needed to roll-out hydrogen-based fuel cell CHP for power &
low/medium grade heat requirements in industry and other large scale applications.
79Synergies
Synergies between the Clean Hydrogen JU and P4P will be explored, focusing on industrial
applications. Other potential synergies could be with the Built4People (B4P) European
partnership and Horizon’s Europe Cluster 5134. See Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details
on the synergies.
Turbines, boilers and burners
Rationale for support
• Turbines
Gas Turbines (GTs) use natural, bio or syngas to provide dispatchable power and heat following
the system and market requirements. In a system with an increasing share of variable electricity
production from non-dispatchable renewable energy sources, the high flexibility of gas turbine-
based power plants can effectively ensure the grid stability and security of supply. Used also in
cogeneration systems, together with thermal storage, they can flexibly provide the necessary
amounts of power and heat for industrial settings or district heating.
Their main advantage lies in the power density, which enables large amounts of power being
available within a very short time and with a small footprint. Moreover, GTs have a significant
fuel flexibility, being able to burn a large variety of different fuel and with varying fuel
composition.
GTs can reach thermal efficiencies up to ~63% in CCGT configurations. In cogeneration CHP
mode, the fuel conversion rate reached is above 90%. There is also a decentralisation
possibility with micro CHP in sites with a significant heat demand.
With the increasing admixture of decarbonised and renewable gases in the gas network, such
as hydrogen, gas turbines increasingly become a source of sustainable dispatchable power
and heat at any time according to the system needs. This in turn allows for additional amounts
of variable renewables to be integrated into the system, supporting Europe’s energy system
decarbonisation pathway. A fuel switch to hydrogen aims to retain all present strengths of gas
turbines while ensuring carbon-free energy conversion.
Yet, the use of diluents or wet low emission (WLE) combustion (legacy technology) provides
today only a sub-optimal solution to hydrogen firing of GTs and the aim of future R&D is to
achieve 100% hydrogen firing by dry low emission (DLE) combustion, still complying with NO
x
emissions targets (up to 25 ppm) without the use of diluents and with minimal thermal efficiency
penalty.
• Boilers and burners
Many processes such as drying, hot quenching or painting in the industry have a demand for
high temperature heat that is today satisfied by gas boilers and burners. In commercial
applications the use of alternatives such as heat pumps is often limited due to the need for high
temperatures and the lack of adequate heat sources (temperature level and space restrictions).
As the share of hydrogen in the gas grid increases and conversion programmes for 100%
hydrogen in the grid appear, there will be a need for hydrogen-fired industrial boilers and
burners to provide high temperature heat. Gas burners and entire boiler units must be 100%
134 Cluster 5 Climate, Energy and Mobility, Destination 4 on Buildings and Industrial Facilities in Energy
Transition
80hydrogen ready and fulfil the same NO emissions standards as gas boilers by 2030.
x
Both gas turbine and burner technologies provide a unique opportunity to reutilise existing
infrastructure, reducing investment costs in new infrastructure and ensuring a cost-competitive
transition to renewable gases and zero-carbon power generation. They do not pose strict
requirements to fuel gas purity and are able to tolerate traces of other species, enabling
therefore the adoption of cost- and energy-effective production and offering hydrogen
conversion technologies at large scale.
All in all, the vision for 2030 is to have 100% hydrogen ready European gas turbines & burners
fulfilling emissions standards, for zero-carbon sustainable dispatchable power and high
temperature heat.
State of the art
• Turbines
Gas turbines are operating with renewable gases generated from carbon-neutral sources or
synthetic fuels, such as synthetic methane, and mixtures of natural gas up to 5% mass / 30%
vol hydrogen with DLE combustion. Currently higher hydrogen contents can only be claimed
by use of dilution or Wet Low Emission (WLE) technology that can significantly affect gas
turbines’ NO emissions, efficiency, lifetime and cost.
x
Thermal efficiency (fuel conversion rate to electricity) depends on GT size (class). Indicative
State-of-the-Art OCGT and CCGT efficiency figures are:
- Heavy-Duty GTs ~44%/63% (100-500 Mwe)
- Industrial GTs ~43%/55% (30-100 Mwe)
- Aeroderivative GTs ~35% (1-30 Mwe)
- Micro GTs ~32% (0.1-1 Mwe)
While the reduction of firing temperature has a positive impact in reducing flame stability issues
and NO emissions in hydrogen firing of GTs, it also negatively affects thermal efficiency, posing
x
a considerable challenge. GTs of all classes (0.1-500 Mwe) are presently used in a wide range
of applications typically using gaseous fuels (natural gas, bio or syngas):
- CHP
- Back-up and peak demand power
- Prime power
- Energy system coupling and flexibility
- Energy supply chain
Europe has a strong turbine industry and a large gas turbine asset.
• Boilers and burners
Today there are no hydrogen burners available on the market for industrial applications. Only
a prototype was developed for industrial applications around 1MW. The next generation of
boilers will be hydrogen ready to be later retrofitted with hydrogen burners. No hydrogen surface
burners are available today. The UK’s project Hy4Heat135 represents an important milestone
135 https://www.hy4heat.info/
81and potential synergy with the Clean Hydrogen JU activity in this context, providing a precious
source of data useful in the development of domestic and hydrogen-fired industrial gas
appliances.
Objectives
• Turbines
In the long-term climate neutral perspective, the installed electrical capacity of variable
renewable energy sources is projected to increase significantly. From a share of around 31%
gross electricity generation in 2015 this is projected to reach between 61-69% in 2030 and
more than 80% in 2050. The integration of these variable electricity generation sources will
require deployment of resources providing flexibility to the energy system. Together with energy
storage solutions, gas turbines will also remain key assets for balancing the electricity system
(as the current technology derating factors of system adequacy mechanisms for electricity,
some recently launched, clearly indicate). The climate neutrality goal for 2050 requires though
that the electricity sector is decarbonised already by 2040, which highlights the need that these
gas turbines are fuelled by low carbon gases.
The objective of this activity area is to prepare gas turbines to run on 100% hydrogen, whilst
keep conversion efficiencies and NO emission to acceptable levels. To achieve the objective
x
the focus of the support should be on research to better understand the implications of using
hydrogen in combustors including NO and flashback control whilst keeping acceptable power
x
efficiencies. Actions such as materials research to cope with the higher temperatures required
to use hydrogen would fall out of the Clean Hydrogen JU.
In order to facilitate the development process and facilitate backward compatibility with
conventional fuels during the transition period, it is likely that support for actions running with
different hydrogen admixtures maybe required in order to achieve the final goal of having 100%
hydrogen turbines. Building on this, support could be expected to demonstrate the retrofitting
of existing gas turbines to run on 100% hydrogen.
• Boilers and burners
Significant progress has been made recently in the area of domestic hydrogen boilers,
especially in the UK, but also in Germany. As hydrogen becomes more available the challenge
remains to have industrial 100% hydrogen ready boilers and burners to provide high
temperature heat and to comply with the NO emissions standards as for conventional gas
x
boilers by 2030. With this in mind support in the Clean Hydrogen JU should be on better
understanding the hydrogen combustion mechanism and in developing or retrofitting boilers
with combustors and burners respectively able to run on 100% hydrogen whilst respecting the
NO emissions standards.
x
Specific actions supporting this area will appear as integral parts of broader projects supporting,
for instance, the direct use/storage of hydrogen from electrolysis at low pressure from
combustion and include also the flexibility of burners towards various fuels (hydrogen, natural
gas, ammonia – normally dedicated to ambient pressure). Those actions should also benefit
from the fundamental low TRL activities on gas turbines and result into activities targeting
applications in a context of full applications beyond mere combustion.
In summary these are the following objectives in this pillar:
1. Allow turbines to run on higher admixtures of H , up to 100% whilst keeping low NO
2 x
emissions, high efficiencies and flexible operation.
822. Develop concepts on safety and plant integration and demonstrate the retrofitting of
turbines, boilers and burners so that they are able to run up to 100% H .
2
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities – Early Stage Research Actions
• Combustion physics, flame stability and combustion dynamics in gas turbine operation
with pure hydrogen, focussing on development of new DLE combustion models for
hydrogen content of 100%.
R&D Priorities – Development Research Actions
• Development of plant integration concepts, business models and value chains, incl.
retrofitting;
• Safety concepts, Standards and Norms (linked to cross-cutting activities);
• Development of pure hydrogen burner for boilers compliant NO emissions (industrial
x
scales). Research areas should focus on flame monitoring, optimal mixture formation,
impact of buoyancy effects, flame stability & flashback, reduction of emissions. Aspects
looking at materials research, such as life-time analysis of thermally high stressed
materials, would fall out of the remit of this partnership;
• Investigation of the influence of hydrogen and higher gas supply pressures on
component tightness and thermal aging behaviour.
R&D Priorities – Demonstration Actions
Demonstration in selected industrial sites in Europe (different plant sizes, from tens to hundreds
of MWs) using advanced gas turbines-based power and heat generation technologies. This
should include upgrade existing plants to safely utilise hydrogen.
Flagship Actions
Not foreseen as dedicated actions but they could be part of flagship actions supported under
other areas.
Synergies
Synergies between the Clean Hydrogen JU, P4P and Clean Steel will be explored, focusing on
industrial applications. Other potential synergies could be with Horizon’s Europe Cluster 5. See
Section 4.1 and Annex 7 for more details on the synergies.
Cross-cutting issues
In order to meet the targets set out in the Hydrogen Strategy, Europe needs to ensure safe and
frictionless deployment of low-carbon hydrogen technologies. Nevertheless, mass-market
commercialisation of hydrogen-based technologies presents a number of systemic (or
horizontal) challenges that need to be addressed to effectively kick-start a hydrogen ecosystem
of significant scale throughout the EU in the coming decade.
Whilst cross-cutting issues such as knowledge management or communication activities are
embedded throughout the entire Programme, a number of specific supporting activities of
horizontal nature are still required in view of reinforcing Europe’s leadership position and to
accelerate mass-market adoption. These supporting activities are encompassed in a cross-
83cutting activity area.
Cross-cutting activity area is a horizontal area aiming at paving the way for the safe and
frictionless roll-out of hydrogen-based technologies at scale by means of the implementation of
a comprehensive set of supporting activities. Building on the experiences and successes of the
FCH 2 JU Programme, the implementation of cross-cutting activities will support and
complement the activities undertaken in other areas of the Programme while facilitating the roll-
out and the commercialisation of hydrogen-based technologies in Europe (and beyond).
Cross-cutting activity area is structured around three focus areas: (i) Sustainability; (ii)
Education and public awareness; and (iii) Safety, pre-normative research and regulations,
codes and standards.
As hydrogen-based technologies become a market value proposition, strengthening the focus
on environmental and sustainability aspects (such as water resources for electrolysis, critical
raw materials use along hydrogen value chains and pollutant emissions) is required in the
framework of the transition to a circular economy, as mentioned in Section 2.1. Furthermore,
continuous education and training are fundamental to safeguard existing expertise and to
prepare a well-educated workforce needed for a competitive hydrogen market, while
underpinning the jobs and value creation in a knowledge-based society in Europe. Public
awareness activities are essential for increasing social acceptance and trust in hydrogen-based
technologies throughout Europe but in particular, for bridging the potential lack of knowledge
or mistrust of key stakeholders directly involved in the first phases of mass deployment in
Europe. Moreover, for a safe deployment of hydrogen technologies in Europe, safety-related
aspects are of paramount relevance. As the technologies will shift from the industrial domain
to the public domain, strengthening hydrogen safety will become one of the priorities of the
Clean Hydrogen JU Programme. Besides, a suitable regulatory framework for hydrogen-based
technologies is necessary for an EU-wide deployment of hydrogen technologies. To this end,
both pre-normative research activities and desk research activities are fundamental for
supporting regulations, codes and standards (RCS) development.
There is also the need that cost benefit analysis among technologies is done on a level playing
field for all carriers and that whole system analyses are performed (with congestion
management costs for all carriers and sector coupling incorporated). All the models used to
plan infrastructure and policy should incorporate as a minimum a simplified version of the
physical constraints of the carrier networks they represent. Today this is the case for some
carriers but not for all, introducing a lack of level playing field in the comparisons and
benchmarks run amongst them. The development of more complete multi-carrier hybrid models
(including infrastructure physics and correctly reflecting network constraints) is a R&D activity
that will have impacts on benchmarks and perceptions.
The following sections provide further details of the research framework envisaged in each of
the above-mentioned focus areas.
Sustainability, LCSA, recycling and eco-design
Rationale for support
Hydrogen-based technologies are ready to start their deployment in different applications and
levels but it is necessary to develop circular and sustainable approaches in the technology
developments and along the hydrogen chain to comply with environmental and social principles
and goals. To this end, further efforts in minimising the impacts of products from its design;
84ensuring its recovery, reuse and recycling with emphasis on the Platinum Group Metals –
PGMs, Critical (Raw) Materials – CRMs and other materials with sustainability or environmental
concerns such as those deriving from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances; and supplying the
necessary assessment tools for decision making are still required in the framework of the
transition to a circular economy.
State of the Art
Circular economy is about creating value for the economy, society and business while
minimising resource use and environmental and social impacts via system thinking. To this
end, life cycle thinking tools have been developed to assess the environmental, social and
economic impact of a product or activity. Life cycle thinking tools include but not limited to Life
Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC), Social Life Cycle Analysis (SLCA) and Life
Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA). In the hydrogen sector, FCH JU projects such as FC-
HYGUIDE136 or SH2E137 account for this. Furthermore, projects like HYTECHCYCLING138 and
BEST4HY139 projects, and eGHOST140 project have started to propose strategies for recycling
as well as for the adaptation of the design of some hydrogen-based products. Nevertheless,
still, further research is needed to consider the hydrogen sector a sustainable and circular
sector.
Objectives
The overarching goal of this focus area is to contribute that the hydrogen sector becomes a
sustainable and circular sector supporting the EU strategy on energy system integration and
contributing towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives
of the Paris Agreement. To improve sustainability and circularity, key focus areas for
development are complete and integrated LCSA tools, enhanced recovery of PGMs/CRMs
including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) based ionomers and membranes,
development of recycling integrated processes, and development of eco-design guidelines and
eco-efficient processes. Thus, the specific objectives in this area are:
1. Develop life cycle thinking tools addressing the three dimensions of sustainable
development: economic, social, and environmental.
2. Develop eco-design guidelines and eco-efficient processes.
3. Develop enhanced recovery processes in particular for PGMs/CRMs and per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances.
To this end, further research is needed to develop reliable methodologies for assessing the
environmental, economic and social impacts of hydrogen-based technologies and their
associated value chains, including their full life-cycle environmental impacts (including “water
balance” impacts), circularity and sustainability. Furthermore, securing the supply of critical raw
materials in parallel to material reduction, substitution, reuse, and recycling needs to become

85Materials Action Plan141, the implementation of the new Circular Economy Action Plan142 and
EU’s trade policy approach with due account being paid to ensuring the security of supply and
high levels of sustainability in Europe. As part of the holistic approach on sustainability-related
aspects, eco-design and eco-efficiency are effective tools for improving the sustainability of
products and processes, contributing to eliminating the least performing products (and/or
processes) from the market, and significantly contributing to the industrial competitiveness and
innovation by promoting the better environmental performance of products and processes.
Sustainability, LCSA, recycling and eco-design activities will be strategically important by 2030.
Indeed, “sustainability and circularity by design” will be addressed in the Clean Hydrogen JU
Programme, supporting the activities undertaken within. To contribute to address these issues,
a number of actions targeting research and innovation, and coordination and support will be
carried out within this focus area. The following list some of the potential actions envisaged:
R&D Priorities - Early Stage Research Actions
Further research to optimise the recycling technology for PEMFC and SOFC, and electrolysis
processes, such as for noble metals and critical materials including perfluorosulfonic acid
membranes and ionomers from components used in these processes. Learnings from this work
should be able to be scaled-up towards market deployment.
R&D Priorities – Demonstration Actions
PEM and Alkaline Electrolysis (PEMEL, AEMEL, and AEL), Polymeric Fuel Cells (PEMFC),
and Storage materials recycling processes will be developed by transferring current industrial
processes already in place for other different value chains than hydrogen. In this regards, the
recycling of the different components of the hydrogen value chain will need to be addressed to
optimise systems components and increase sustainability and circularity.
Coordination and Support Actions
Building on the previous projects’ activities and results, coordination and support actions will
be made throughout the following areas:
• Eco-design/sustainable design guidelines;
• Eco-efficiency integrated in fuel cells and hydrogen-based technologies manufacturing,
complementing the activities undertaken in the supply chain area.
• Development of Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs);
• Regionalised LCSA;
• SLCA-LCC on supply chains;
• Database for LCSA indicators;
Education and public Awareness
Rationale for support
Over the past few years, the European hydrogen industry has made great strides and currently,
it is poised to take the next step and achieve significant levels of commercialisation. This will

86enable significant economic growth to take place primarily within Europe, keeping high value-
added jobs, and creating a supply chain of EU companies around a new suite of products based
on hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. Combined with EU’s leadership in renewables
technologies, the emergence of a European hydrogen value chain serving a multitude of
industrial sectors and other end uses will employ millions of people, directly or indirectly.
In 2017, the Hydrogen Council143 indicated the hydrogen sector could provide sustainable
employment for more than 30 million people around the world by 2050. Furthermore, the
Hydrogen Roadmap Europe analysis144 pointed a total of 5.4 million direct jobs created by the
European industry in 2050 (‘ambitious’ scenario).
In the EU, the Commission is placing skills at the heart of the EU policy agenda, steering
investment in people and their skills for a sustainable recovery after the coronavirus pandemic,
and in July 2020 presented the European Skills Agenda145 for sustainable competitiveness,
social fairness, and resilience. As first of the flagship actions under the European Skills Agenda,
in November 2020, the Commission launched the Pact for Skills146 to support a fair and resilient
recovery and deliver on the ambitions of the green and digital transitions and of the EU
Industrial and SME Strategies.
Therefore, to unlock opportunities for more and better jobs, as well as growth and
competitiveness, the training of skilled educated manpower as the upskill or reskill of current
workforce in declining industries are crucial to succeeding in the needed scaling–up of this
emerging European industry.
On the other hand, mass deployment requires strong knowledge management and effective
dissemination of this knowledge. In this context, further efforts are also required to promote the
social awareness and public trust in hydrogen technology and hydrogen-based products to
raise the levels of knowledge about them and to achieve widespread use while fostering
sustainable growth and jobs alongside their deployment.
In this context, there is a need for a generalised market-wise cross-functional expertise across
energy carriers, whereby synergies can be detected and exploited amongst all the carriers.
Sector coupling will eventually require cross-carrier operational optimisations (and trades with
certificates) that will require of this knowledge. Green hydrogen and RFNBOs in general require
an understanding of both electricity issues and gaseous molecules potential and about the
operation of both markets (and also of heat as an addition). Lack of this knowledge may lead
to mono-carrier approaches while one-carrier solutions will be less efficient, cost more to the
public and lead to higher emissions and lesser penetration and integration of renewables.
State of the art
Technical knowledge about hydrogen and its technology leads to greater acceptability through
increased levels of confidence in the technology. Over the last years, educational and training
material and programs on hydrogen technologies have been developed. Projects such as
TRAINHY-PROF147, and more recently KNOWHY148, NET-TOOLS149, TEACHY150 and

87FCHGO151 project to name but a few have developed educational programs and training
initiatives related to hydrogen technologies and fuel cells in Europe. Altogether, these projects
have addressed different types of and levels of education (formal, vocational, etc.), different
target groups (under/post/graduates, policy makers, technicians, responders), different
technologies and applications (PEM, SO, fuel cells, electrolysers, hydrogen production by
different means, purification) along the hydrogen chain, including horizontal aspects such as
safety or life cycle assessment. They have covered different pedagogical approaches
(“traditional” transmissive approach, collaborative learning, hands-on), different features
(serious games, virtual reality, e-learning) and different levels of accreditations and/or
certifications (diploma, certificate, official, private), in line with the European Skills Agenda and
the Pact for Skills launched by the European Commission in 2020.
Concerning public acceptance, several studies have been conducted on the social recognition
and acceptance of hydrogen energy. Projects like HYACINTH152 project have provided the base
information about the awareness and social trust in the hydrogen technologies in Europe,
showing a general higher level of confidence in the technology and acceptability of its use, but
lower levels of knowledge about hydrogen technology. Moreover, projects have gathered
relevant information on administrative, legal and economic barriers to the implementation of
hydrogen technologies, but these findings need to be further transferred to relevant
stakeholders, such as local, regional or national authorities, which are ultimately responsible
for integration.
Objectives
The goal of this focus area is twofold: to prepare a well-educated and high-skilled workforce
needed for a competitive hydrogen market, safeguarding existing expertise and know-how,
while raising public awareness and social acceptance about hydrogen technologies. To this
end, the specific objectives in this area are:
1. Develop educational and training material and building training programs for
professionals and students on hydrogen and fuel cells.
2. Raise public awareness and trust towards hydrogen technologies and their system
benefits.
On education, the underlying strategy focus is two-fold. On one hand, activities will focus on
updating the educational and training material already in place for the target groups already
addressed. On the other hand, to develop new educational and training materials for new
targets groups not covered so far. Training programs, in particular, will need to be designed
and capacity building planned, incorporating new aspects such as systems modelling.
Furthermore, the programs need to be further extended and should be rolled out in more
languages to further strengthen the access of the public to such material. To this end, all the
educational and training material developed in the Programme will be provided publicly
available and accessible free of charge, in particular on the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen
Observatory (FCHO) platform153. This will grant widespread access to the knowledge while
contributing to developing the necessary talent to support a growing hydrogen industry.
Concerning public awareness, the activities will target not only awareness but also raising trust.
Activities will focus on hydrogen technology as a whole and will target specific groups of
151 https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/826246
152 https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/621228
153 https://fchobservatory.eu/
88stakeholders (from technicians to chief executive officers in public and /or private entities) from
sectors and territories for which development and deployment of low-carbon hydrogen
technologies can play an important role. Communication activities targeting the public will not
be disregarded but will be carefully addressed on a case-by-case basis, as the deployment
evolves and mainly at the programme level.
To address these issues, the Programme will carry out a number of actions targeting research
and innovation, and coordination and support. The following list some of the potential actions
envisaged.
R&D Priorities – Early Stage Research Actions
• Further development of innovative education using latest IT technologies and
implementation in training processes of stakeholders from children through students to
teachers (e.g. digital models, twins, living laboratories, short-term courses).
R&D Priorities – Demonstration Actions
• Integration aspects with social sciences and develop educational and public
understanding and trust, including contributions from humanities when relevant.
• Development and installation of a virtual European university on hydrogen and fuel cells
educational targets including service and specific events e.g. summer and winter
schools.
Coordination and Support Actions
• Preparation and dissemination material for education and training at all levels in
different languages.
• Building training programmes for young professionals in the hydrogen and fuel cell field,
including events for training and education to different stakeholders.
Safety, Pre-Normative Research and Regulations, Codes and Standards
Rationale for support
The hydrogen industry has accumulated several decades of experience and know-how, built
up in an industrial setting, in handling large amounts of hydrogen safely. Nevertheless, the
relative lack of general experience with introducing hydrogen-based technologies in settings
where it was not traditionally located (in people’s cars, buses, homes, fuelling ships, in refuelling
stations alongside conventional fuels, etc.) increases the risks of incidents or accidents and
delays the time necessary for commercial product deployment. A high-level degree of hydrogen
safety is essential to build the confidence needed for widespread take-up and safe
commercialisation of hydrogen technologies. Consistent safety approaches along the hydrogen
chain should be built on best practices for the implementation of safety principles and
procedures facilitating the safe design, operation and management of hydrogen-based
technologies in Europe and beyond. Hydrogen safety culture needs to be embedded at all
levels and will become a priority in the Programme.
Furthermore, driving hydrogen development past the tipping point needs an enabling policy
and regulatory framework. Beyond policies, which are out of the scope of the objectives of the
Programme, there is still a need to develop even further comprehensive regulatory and
enabling frameworks for hydrogen technologies in Europe. In many instances, the lack of clear
rules, technical regulations and standards is a core reason why “projects” do not evolve into
89mass-market “products”. For example, regarding hydrogen injection in natural gas networks,
Regulations, Codes and Standards for hydrogen technology will need to be developed at the
EU level to ensure these applications are not restricted in their roll-out.
State of the art
Safety is paramount for frictionless development, perception, acceptance of and trust in new
technologies in modern society. Over the last decades, hydrogen safety-related activities have
advanced the state of the art and fundamental aspects related to hydrogen behaviour in the
event of accidental (unwanted) releases and their consequences. The activities scope has also
encompassed progress in the understanding of both, passive and active safety measures to
reduce and/or de-risk the use of hydrogen in confined, semi-confined and open-air sites and
locations. Recent projects such as HYSEA154, PRESLHY155, HYTUNNEL-CS156 or H2SENSE157
to name but a few account for this. Furthermore, education and training programs have also
tackled safety aspects, the HYRESPONSE158 project being a good example. Nevertheless,
recent safety-related events have shown that more efforts are required to embed such a culture
within this fast-growing sector.
EU funded projects also allowed improvement in the understanding of the applicable regulation
for boosting the production and utilisation of hydrogen in Europe, while strengthening the
European leadership in international fora for technical standards, regulations and definitions on
hydrogen. The majority of the projects have encompassed Pre-Normative Research (PNR)
activities aiming at providing sound scientifically and technological facts to either filling the
existing gaps in RCS or progressing beyond the knowledge available at that point in time.
Projects such as HYCORA159, FIRECOMP160, HYTUNNEL-CS161, STACKTEST162 or
SOCTESTQA163 account for this. Moreover, recent projects like HYLAW164 have undertaken
desk research to understand the legal and administrative barriers blocking the widespread
commercialisation of hydrogen technologies in Europe, while proposing solutions to overcome
the challenges. Another relevant initiative has been conducted by the CERTIFHY165 project and
follow up initiatives which have assessed the necessary market and regulatory conditions to
develop the complete design and initiate a unique European framework for renewable and low-
carbon hydrogen guarantees of origin.
Objectives
The goal of this focus area is twofold: safety is understood and treated as a holistic, integrated
and value-adding approach at each stage of the implementation, and to ensure that hydrogen
and fuel cell specific harmonised RCS are in place and support the safe and efficient
deployment of hydrogen technologies in Europe and beyond. To this end, the specific
objectives in this area are:

901. Increase the level of safety of hydrogen technologies and applications
2. Support the development of RCS for hydrogen technologies and applications, with the
focus on standards
Further research is needed to ensure hydrogen technologies are as safe as competing
technologies and to demonstrate that the risks associated with hydrogen technologies are at
least equivalent to, if not lower, than for established energy technologies.
Moreover, further research is needed to support policymaking, in particular, to enable improved
and harmonised RCS. To this end, the role of PNR activities in supporting technical regulations
and standards will become fundamental. PNR activities will encompass research activities and
strengthen desk research activities in view of supporting RCS developments.
Furthermore, following up on the activities started in the CERTIFHY project and subsequent
FCH 2 JU initiatives, supporting activities are also envisaged to contribute to the EU effort to
introduce a common low-carbon threshold/standard for the promotion of hydrogen production
installations based on their full life-cycle GHG performance. Activities would introduce a
comprehensive terminology and European-wide criteria (or support the European Commission
work on the international-wide criteria within collaborations with International Partnership for
Hydrogen and fuel cells in the Economy – IPHE - and Clean Energy Ministerial - CEM) for
guarantees of origins and the certification of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.
Altogether, in light of the 2030 targets recently published by the European Commission, support
could contribute to the update of energy and climate framework, in particular:
- EU ETS directive and Effort Sharing Regulation;
- Renewable Energy Directive;
- Energy Efficiency Directive;
- Energy Taxation Directive;
- Sustainable Alternative Fuels initiatives;
- TEN-E / TEN-T Regulation and Alternative Fuels Directive;
- CO performance standards.
2
To address these issues, the Programme will carry out a number of actions targeting research
and innovation, and coordination and support.
The following list some of the potential actions envisaged.
R&D Priorities – Early Stage Research Actions
• Improved understanding of the hydrogen behaviour on both gaseous and liquid form in
the event of accidental (unwanted) releases and their consequences to support the
development of RCS in heat, maritime, railways, heavy-duty and aerospace application;
• Improved understanding of hydrogen embrittlement, thermal attacks and effects also in
non-metallic materials;
• Safe refuelling, bunkering and storage protocols; in particular for large inventories and
LH (Incl. specific aspects associated with the maritime sector);
2
• PNR to support heavy-duty crash standardisation, including recognition of FCEV and
health state of on-board storage by responders (road, rail, maritime), development of
91protocols for non-destructive testing of composite overwrapped pressure vessels
(COPVs);
• Review of refuelling processes and quantification of over-conservatism in refuelling and
on-board storage;

• Support the trainers of 1st and 2nd responders with regular updates from Early Stage
Research, Development Research and Innovation actions;
• Development of an open and validated risk assessment toolkit, suitable to serve as a
reference in standards;
• Continuous monitoring of the regulatory barriers.
Hydrogen valleys
Rationale for support
Since 2014, FCH JU has pursued the concept of hydrogen territories, which have evolved into
the most recent concept of Hydrogen Valleys. A Hydrogen Valley is a defined geographical
area, city, region or industrial area where several hydrogen applications are combined together
and integrated within an FCH ecosystem. The idea is to demonstrate how all the different parts
of the use of hydrogen as an energy vector fit together in an integrated system approach. This
concept has gained momentum and is now one of the main priorities of industry and the EC for
scaling-up hydrogen deployments and creating interconnected hydrogen ecosystems across
Europe. Hydrogen Valleys have started to form the first regional "hydrogen economies", as
bottom-up steppingstones in the development of the New Hydrogen Economy overall. Now,
hydrogen valleys are going global, with new projects emerging worldwide166 and Mission
166 In straight cooperation with the European Commission (on behalf of the European Union) in its role
of co-leader of the Innovation Challenge 8 (Renewable and Clean Hydrogen) of Mission Innovation, the
FCH 2 JU developed the Hydrogen Valley Platform (www.h2v.eu), a global information sharing
platform providing valuable data. Already more than 30 hydrogen valleys are presented in this platform.
An analysis of these valleys has been performed and findings are presented in the report ‘Hydrogen
valleys – insights into the emerging hydrogen economies around the world’ – Fuel Cells And Hydrogen
92Innovation members having committed to facilitate the delivery of at least 100 large-scale clean
hydrogen valleys worldwide by 2030167.
The aim of supporting the creation of Hydrogen Valleys is to demonstrate the role of hydrogen
in energy system integration and synergies between the three pillars (production, storage &
distribution and end use applications), to identify the best business-cases and showcase the
value proposition of hydrogen with emphasis on sectoral-integration, while applying existing
regulations.
The emphasis is not on the technology development of an application, but on system integration
of hydrogen production, its distribution and storage, and its subsequent valorisation as an
energy vector in transport, as industrial feedstock for the production/upgrading of
chemicals/fuels and/or in the electricity/gas grid.
A Hydrogen Valley should not only demonstrate how hydrogen technologies work in synergy,
but it should also work complementary with (or reuse of) other elements: renewable production,
gas infrastructure, electricity grid, batteries, etc.
A key objective is to demonstrate the notion of “system efficiency and resilience”: it is not only
the energy efficiency of a single application that matters but the overall energy and economic
efficiency and resilience of the integrated system.
Although for the sake of these demonstrations it can be foreseen that in the early stages low
carbon hydrogen could be used, the objective is to move to renewable hydrogen as an ultimate
objective. CCS, SMR or coal gasification investments are excluded from partnership funding.
State of the art
Currently, the FCH 2 JU supports three hydrogen territories,168 in the norther Scottish islands
of Orkney, the northern regions of the Netherlands and the island of Majorca (Spain). Although
they vary significantly in size, they all have in common integrating hydrogen production from
renewable electricity. In some cases, this electricity would have been curtailed and the
integration of hydrogen into the energy system is avoiding this, defying the common metrics for
energy efficiency. Also common to all of them is the search for various storage and distribution
solutions that are really specific to each territory, the amount of hydrogen produced, the type
of end use and the distance to the end uses. And finally, in the three supported cases, different
end uses from various sectors are represented. The main difference between the projects lays
in the size/amount of hydrogen used. But it is clear that in all cases, there are synergies
between the different applications and the holistic virtues of the overall system.
Additionally the Mission Innovation Hydrogen Valley Platform, developed by the Fuel Cells and
Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, aims to create a global collaboration and go-to-platform for all
information on large-scale hydrogen flagship projects around the world. By promoting the
emergence and implementation of value chain integrating hydrogen projects, as well as raising
awareness among policy makers, it aims to facilitate the clean energy transition. Dedicated to
all current and future hydrogen project developers, it will help them to gather meaningful

93information from experienced peers and will promote collaboration among them.
Objectives
In terms of innovation the projects to be developed should seek:
1. System integration: what is expected is not innovation in developing one technology but
in integrating several elements together to improve overall synergies and facilitate
sector coupling;
2. System efficiency: what is expected is the improvement of overall energy and economic
efficiency of the integrated system;
3. Improved security and resilience of the energy system, e.g. via hydrogen production
using locally available renewable energy sources;
4. Market creation: demonstration of new market for hydrogen, especially when
applications are used in synergies;
5. Complementarity of hydrogen with RES, integration with other technologies, existing
infrastructure, etc;
6. Assessment of the availability and affordability of clean (pollution free) energy provision
for industry and cities uses; whilst also considering environmental impacts like water
utilisation;
7. Mutualisation of production or distribution and storage, assuming decentralisation as
key parameter;
8. Help set or test regulation requirements at the relevant governance level;
9. Increase the knowledge management with assessment of the socio-economic and
environmental impacts, including the concept of digital twin assuring an effective
monitor and optimisation strategy for the operation and further development of the
valley;
10. Development of public awareness of hydrogen technologies including contributions
from Social Science and Humanities when relevant.
11. Support development of Hydrogen Valleys in areas of Europe with no or limited
presence of Hydrogen Valleys;
R&D Priorities
When defining the scope of a valley, these should combine production, hydrogen logistics or
distribution and its use in several sectors, such as in transport and/or stationary/industrial
applications. Systems modelling and simulation can generate different integration scenarios to
support decision-making, including the integration with renewables, existing infrastructures,
etc. Some of the larger projects are expected to be reaching the €100 million or more total
costs. However, the financial contribution requested from the Clean Hydrogen JU should be
limited to 20-30%, with the additional expenditure coming from the project promoters or from
other sources. An important element of these hydrogen valleys would be the regional and
national political support.
A very important aspect to be expected of the valleys is their replicability and continuity/future
expansion. Already in the previous FCH 2 JU Programme, this aspect has been key in the
selection of the appropriate projects and they have been requested to show initiatives and
94activities to facilitate the replication of their concept in other territories. The availability of
modelling tools and the different scenarios developed in previous project will ease the
replicability assessment. In the current Programme, the valleys should be defined such that it
is technically and economically feasible to reproduce them across Europe (spill-over effect). As
for their continuity and expansion, these projects should be defined such that they will not be
dismantled once the funding ends, but rather that they will be just the seed for further
developments.
Some examples of hydrogen valleys could be:
• Ports with combined production, transport and use of hydrogen for various applications
such as ship fuel, port operation (material handling/power use at berth, etc), transport
(possibly import/export) and storage, the port industrial hinterland and/or logistical hub
(truck or trains);
• Airports with combined production, transport, liquefaction, storage, distribution and use
of hydrogen:
o for aviation fuel (hydrogen as a fuel; hydrogen made fuels; hydrogen fuel cells),
o for mobility uses: (a) airport operation (ground support equipment/ground power
units at airport), (b) intramodality hub (buses, cars, and/or trains), and (c)
logistical hub (trucks, heavy handling equipment),
o for stationary uses (energy and heat for airport and surrounding territory
buildings),
o and for industrial uses in the airport vicinity.
• Industrial hubs with mutualised hydrogen production and transport and/or storage with
multiple hydrogen uses (steel, refineries, chemicals, glass, industrial heat and power,
etc);
• Logistical hubs with combined production and use of hydrogen for mutualised and
decentralised production, mobility uses (trains, HDVs, last mile, forklifts, etc.) and uses
in buildings and industrial heat and power;
• A Hydrogen island (or area) combining production, distribution and different end uses
in buildings, transport, industry and agriculture.
Supply chain
Rationale for support
A typical supply chain comprises a series of steps, from the manufacture of materials and
components to production of assemblies and systems for various end-uses. These steps are
similar to those involved in the value chain concept. While the supply chain focuses on
integrating suppliers and manufacturing, the value chain approach takes into account additional
aspects such as increasing value to the customer, the socio-economic aspects or creating
competitive advantage against other players.
This section proposes a set of actions for the next decade aiming at strengthening the overall
supply chain of hydrogen technologies, from processing the raw materials into specialised
materials (e.g. electro-catalysts), production of components and sub-system to system
integration. The supply chain is complemented by the wider view of the value chain approach
vis-à-vis creation of jobs, added value to economy and industry competitiveness.
95Hydrogen technologies and systems have been recently identified by the European
Commission as an emerging and strategic value chain for Europe.169 A strong and sustainable
European supply chain of hydrogen technologies will avoid that the manufacturing capacity
becomes a limiting factor to technology uptake, improve the competitiveness and innovation of
industries, support the decarbonisation of the economy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels,
CRMs and components imports.
To ensure a sustainable, innovative and competitive industry in the future, a greater number of
qualified companies is required along the whole hydrogen supply chain (materials, machines,
systems, etc). Otherwise, the long-term value will go elsewhere as other countries will develop
more mature capabilities and supply chain clusters.
Moreover, Europe will have to increase its production capacity for hydrogen technologies and
raise private investments from EU organisations, including creation of partnerships between
small and large companies, in line with the European Hydrogen Strategy goals.
State of the art
In the recent years, the FCH 2 JU concluded several studies to map the EU supply/value chain
for hydrogen and fuel cell technologies to identify weaknesses and find appropriate solutions.170
A list of suppliers of fuel cell systems and components and service providers is currently
available through the FCHO.
The supply chain of hydrogen-based technologies is still under development and consists
mainly of relatively small organisations. European companies and research organisations are
frontrunners in many segments along the hydrogen supply chain. This should give an
advantage to the EU countries in the upcoming race for market capture and competitive
advantage with other key players such as Japan, South Korea, USA and more recently China.
About 300 European companies contribute to the development of hydrogen technologies and
many more are involved in various steps of the hydrogen supply chain. These providers are
sustained by over 250 knowledge-based European universities and research institutes across
different domains of expertise.
The European suppliers consist mainly of SMEs that are eager to increase their manufacturing
capacities to enable cost reductions of their products. These organisations must focus for
instance on R&I platforms, development of new machines and more efficient manufacturing
processes, which should also facilitate the implementation of the circular economy principles.
All these will allow them to reach a greater market penetration and expand their businesses
also to overseas markets.
As regards hydrogen production, Europe is a global leader of various electrolyser technologies
covering the entire hydrogen supply chain. For many years, European manufacturers have
developed innovative electrolyser technologies and now they are ready to scale up their
products. About 20 European companies offer various electrolysis systems to the market.
Further development of the electrolyser technologies, the integration with renewable sources
and increasing mass production will significantly reduce the total hydrogen production cost in
the next 10 years and beyond. It is essential to ensure Europe will have enough electrolyser
manufacturing capacity to meet its local hydrogen production targets.
Europe has further strengths in hydrogen storage and distribution infrastructure, with
169 Strengthening Strategic Value Chains for a future-ready EU Industry, EC, 2019.
170 Value added of the hydrogen and fuel cell sector in Europe, FCH 2 JU, 2019.
96indigenous developers and suppliers in relevant areas, though some weaknesses exist in the
supply chain. For example, high-pressure hydrogen storage is one of the existing solutions for
on-board transport applications. However, Europe lacks production of high-quality carbon fibre,
an important material used in the manufacture of compressed hydrogen tanks, which is mainly
imported from Asia. In addition, Europe should increase its efforts to develop other cost
competitive solutions (e.g. LOHCs, metal hydrides, ammonia, etc.), optimise the roundtrip
efficiency of the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation cycle and support their industrial deployment.
In the long-term, large-scale storage facilities need also to be created close to the MW scale
electrolysers, including underground hydrogen storage in reconverted salt caverns and
depleted gas fields.
In the medium and long-term an integrated transportation system and infrastructure must be
created to allow clean hydrogen to reach various industrial sectors, thus helping to establish a
global hydrogen market.
Regarding the end-use of hydrogen, Europe is well positioned for competitive fuel cell
materials, components and stacks for both transport and small-scale stationary applications.
This includes quality control and manufacturing techniques as well as a well-established
knowledge transfer between academia/research centres and industry.
Objectives
European manufacturers must cover the main segments of the supply chain, including the
production of very specialised materials, components and equipment, and should consider the
recovery and recycling of by-products and wastes. The components manufacture and their
scale-up based on a circular approach will be the central part of the hydrogen supply chain.
The Clean Hydrogen JU activities will contribute to reinforce the EU leadership on advanced
materials and components used in hydrogen technologies by optimisation of the manufacturing
processes, using abundant natural resources, improving the products quality (targeting zero
defect products), developing new architecture, reducing the time to market through
technological/research platforms, etc. Alongside the manufacture of components for FCH
products, it will also be worth looking at the production of machines/robotics needed for the
automation of manufacture processes. All these activities will allow the cost reduction and
scaling up of components and product equipment for hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.
A particular attention will be paid to continuously monitor the hydrogen supply chain, including
mapping the EU suppliers in each step of production as well as the refuelling infrastructure in
Europe. This monitoring exercise will be complemented by a gap analysis aiming at identifying
potential vulnerabilities in the domestic supply and define R&I actions to mitigate such
weaknesses. While the study will focus primarily on the market supply side, the economic
aspects should be also captured through a value chain analysis.
Another key objective is to bring relevant hydrogen technologies close to commercialisation
and support, from a technological point of view, the increase of production capacity in Europe.
Cross-border cooperation, pan European research and technology infrastructures with
leveraged R&I investments, skills for cross-cutting activities and synergies with other EU
initiatives and funding programmes will promote further the industrialisation and
commercialisation of hydrogen-based technologies. In addition, a greater participation of major
European manufacturers is needed in the whole supply chain, which can be stimulated by
raising public and industry awareness.
A common understanding of the impact of materials in contact with hydrogen is needed not
97only for structural and safety reasons, but also on the quality of hydrogen for various
applications. As an example while fuel cells are reacting quite sensitive to minor outgassing of
sulphur containing species, such traces are irrelevant in combustion engines, turbines of steel
production.
Reducing the use of CRMs in hydrogen electrolysers and fuel cells, sustaining the recovery
and recycling of by-products and wastes, and circularity of end-of-life products will reinforce the
upstream part of the supply chain.
Overall, the main objectives of this pillar can be summarised to:
1. Identification of potential vulnerabilities in EUs hydrogen supply chain;
2. Development of new and improved manufacturing technologies and production
processes that facilitate the safe and sustainable use of non-critical (raw) materials as
well as facilitate the adoption of the circular economy principles;
3. Reducing the use of critical (raw) materials. with sustainability or environmental
concerns, such as for instance those deriving from poly/perfluoroalkyls.
In order to contribute towards achieving the above objectives, the following areas of research
and development appear as good candidates for the support by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
R&D Priorities – Early Stage Research Actions
• Development of new manufacturing technologies and production processes, including
innovative sensors and actuators for semi-automation and automation of equipment
production and real-time quality control;
• Improve production speed, circularity, process capabilities and production yield through
fast detection of defects, technical cleanliness, etc;
R&D Priorities – Development Research Actions
• Continuous mapping, gap analysis and monitoring of the critical components and sub-
systems supply, weaknesses and bottlenecks along the hydrogen supply chain through
joint, well-coordinated actions;
• Identifying changes in manufacturing approach that will improve production speed,
labour costs and circularity.
• Identification of materials in contact with hydrogen for different use cases.
• Training and skills on manufacturing (qualified people, technicians, maintenance and
after-sales, etc.), linked with cross-cutting activities;
• Integration of new manufacturing technologies and improve the production speed,
circularity, process capabilities and yield in parallel with real-time quality control in the
manufacturing process;
• Identification of synergies between EU suppliers of machines with multiple uses that
can contribute to increasing the manufacturing capacity of hydrogen technologies;
• Exploring the possibility of using artificial intelligence and other emerging digital
technologies to improve the manufacturing and/or maintenance of fuel cells, electrolyser
components or other crucial equipment;
• The creation of Digital Twin tools, for failure and reliability forecasts, grid stabilisation,
98system optimisation, risk assessment, renewable energy integration impact as well as
virtual testbeds for new business models, and economical feasibility of new concepts;
• Exploring the Distributed Ledger Technologies to establish a trusted sector coupled co-
creating eco-system.
R&D Priorities – Demonstration Actions
• Supply chain innovation approach and implementation of quality measures within
medium and large manufacturing capacity;
• Development of pan European technology (testing) platforms based on the gap analysis
of the study of the supply and value chains.
Strategic Research Challenges
To ensure a continuous generation of early stage research knowledge, the above actions will
be supplemented by multidisciplinary investigations, gathering expertise at different technology
scale (materials, component, cell, stack and system). All the generated knowledge needs also
to be combined in such a way to allow further comprehensive interpretations. The usual
superposition of 3-year research projects does not really appear to be the optimum option to
ensure a continuum in early stage research knowledge. The proposed approach considers
gathering, with a long-term vision and covering the whole Clean Hydrogen JU activities, the
needed capabilities and expertise from European Research and Technology Organisations
(RTO).
Potential synergies in the field of basic research linked to breakthrough hydrogen technologies
and innovation are emphasised with the European Innovation Council (EIC), for example on
the other routes of renewable hydrogen production through the EIC Pathfinder Challenge and
the research areas on hydrogen proposed by the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA).
The alignment of European RTOs’ efforts in critical research areas enables to complement the
strengths of each organisation by streamlining access to unique research tools, developing
missing strategic capabilities, and developing a public database of information. The result will
lead to a generally comprehensive strategy investigating new design, characterisation and
testing, thus accelerating the developments in basic low-TRL research and innovation actions.
Based on the early stage research actions mentioned in the different previous roadmaps, the
following strategic research challenges appear the most relevant:
• Low or free PGM catalysts (including bioinspired catalysts), reducing critical (raw)
materials use in electrolysers and fuel cells, and safe and sustainable use of all material,
including developing of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-free ionomers and
membranes.
• Advanced materials and processes for hydrogen storage (e.g. carbon fibres, H carriers,
2
additive manufacturing)
• Advanced understanding of the performance / durability mechanisms of electrolysers
and fuel cells.
For these early stage research actions, providing testing facilities to SMEs could facilitate them
to test their innovative technologies and bring them up in TRL to potential products. The
implementation of Open Innovation Test Beds (OITB) in the Hydrogen Sector will be further
explored.
994. Additional activities
Interface with EU policies and other programmes (Synergies)
Need to reinforce synergies
An important element supporting the implementation of the European hydrogen strategy is the
reinforcement of synergies among European funding instruments and actions to close the
innovation gap in Europe. Synergies are needed pull together resources, align priorities and
ultimately maximise the impact of clean hydrogen R&I investments.
The Single Basic Act establishing the Horizon Europe Joint Undertakings underlines the
impact-driven approach to European partnerships. This Regulation aims at a more effective
use of institutionalised European partnerships notably by focusing on clear objectives,
outcomes and impact that can be achieved by 2030, and by ensuring a clear contribution to the
related Union policy priorities and policies. For this endeavour, close collaboration and
synergies between JUs and other relevant initiatives at Union, national and regional level are
key in achieving greater scientific, socio-economic and environmental impact and ensuring
uptake of results.171
Furthermore, the SBA considers it is essential that the clean hydrogen partnership establishes
structured collaboration with many other European partnerships, notably for end-use.
Structured cooperation will facilitate the creation of collaboration and synergies between
European partnerships, allowing to identify areas in which complementary or joint activities
would address the challenges more effectively and efficiently, avoid overlaps, align timing of its
activities and ensure access to results and other relevant means of knowledge exchange.172,173
The Clean Hydrogen JU should interact in particular with the zero emission road and
waterborne transport, Europe’s railway, clean aviation, processes for the planet and clean steel
European partnerships.174 In line with the Single Basic Act, a structure will be set up reporting
to the Governing Board in order to ensure the co-operation and synergies between these
partnerships in the domain of hydrogen.175
Likewise, beyond the Governing Board176 and the Executive Director177, other bodies of the
Joint Undertaking also share responsibilities regarding synergies, namely in what concerns
reporting about the national or regional policies relevant to the scope of the JU and identifying
specific ways of cooperation (policies and support schemes) with the actions funded by the JU
in view facilitating the acceleration of market uptake of innovative clean hydrogen solutions.
The State Representatives Group178 and the Stakeholders Group179, shall be consulted on links
to Horizon Europe and other Union, national and, where relevant, regional initiatives, including

To deliver the magnitude of synergies envisaged in the SBA it is necessary to resort to the
whole toolbox made available under the Horizon Europe framework and establish the proper
cooperation mechanisms that will put these tools to work, as described below.
Toolbox to generate funding synergies
In view of generating funding synergies, the Single Basic Act enables JUs to make use of all
the tools made available under the Regulation (EU) 2021/695 establishing Horizon Europe,
namely.180 Horizon Europe provisions to enable different types of synergies include alternative,
cumulative and combined funding and transfer of resources.181
These tools materialise into the following categories:
• Alternative funding following the awarding of a Seal of Excellence foreseen for calls for
proposals in the work programme. Actions which were awarded a Seal of Excellence
may be eligible for support by other Union programmes provided that they comply with
all of the following conditions:
o they have been assessed in a call for proposals under the Programme;
o they comply with the minimum quality requirements of that call for proposals;
o they have not been financed under that call for proposals only due to budgetary
constraints.
• Co-funded actions between different Programmes. These actions allow cumulative
funding between different Union programmes, provided that the contributions do not
cover the same costs. The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the
corresponding contribution to the action. The cumulative financing shall not exceed the
total eligible costs of the action.
• Transfer of Resources from Member States to the Programme. Those resources shall
be used for the benefit of the Member State concerned only.
The overall principle is that the JU activities shall be implemented in synergy with other Union
programmes while aiming for maximal administrative simplification. A non-exhaustive list of
synergies with other Union programmes is included in Annex IV - Synergies with other Union
programmes of the Regulation (EU) 2021/695. It makes explicit reference to synergies between
Horizon Europe and EAFDR, ERDF, ESF+, CEF, Life, InvestEU, Innovation Fund, Just
Transition Mechanism, Euratom, European Defence Fund, Recovery and Resilience Facility,
etc.
Building on the successful experiences from the previous programming period, specific areas
for synergies between different funding instruments and the JU could be flagship projects
related to Hydrogen Valleys and the implementation of AFIR.

Cooperation mechanisms to deliver synergies
Given the multitude of actors in the different bodies of the JU and to cover the full spectrum of
synergies the JU may contribute to (and benefit from) to achieve its 2030 targets, the following
areas have been identified in view of establishing effective cooperation mechanisms:
- Synergies with other European partnerships and EU Funds
Hydrogen is a cross-cutting technology with applications in numerous sectors having specific
needs in terms of research, innovation and market development and deployment. The Clean
Hydrogen JU will be at the core of research and innovation activities related to hydrogen
production, distribution and end uses for energy, transport and industry. The integration,
deployment and scale-up of hydrogen technologies in all related sectors will require additional,
complementary and coordinated research and innovation efforts which will be carried out in
synergy with the end-use partnerships covering hydrogen in their programme182.
The Clean Hydrogen JU is called upon to set up a structured cooperation with the hydrogen
end-use European partnerships, seeking opportunities to involve them in discussions during
the drafting of their work programmes, in order to identify the areas in which complementary or
joint activities would address the challenges more effectively and efficiently, avoid overlaps and
align timings of the activities to ensure access to results and other relevant means of knowledge
exchange.
In addition, the European Commission has an important role to play in enhancing synergies,
collaboration and bridging the gaps between different partnerships and beyond. It is also
important that the Horizon Europe governance arrangements bridge these gaps and deliver on
the expectations for enhanced cross-fertilisation between initiatives183.
By strengthening linkages with other Horizon Europe initiatives as well as other EU funded
programmes, the Clean Hydrogen JU together with the other European partnerships have
better chances to deliver on the ambitious 2030 targets and contribute to EU priorities and
policies.

102- Synergies with Member States
The JU “(…) should ensure that Member States are sufficiently informed of the joint
undertakings’ activities, can provide timely information on activities undertaken in the
Member States and have the opportunity to contribute to the preparatory and decision-
making processes. Such dialogue with Member States is particularly important in the
context of synergies and the need to ensure the alignment of efforts and activities at
national, regional, Union and European level to create more impact.” Given that Member
States are not directly or indirectly involvement as members or constituent entities of the
JU, a State Representatives Group shall be established with the aim of aligning the JU’s
activities with the policies and actions taken at national and regional level.184
- Synergies with other Stakeholders
In addition, with the view to ensuring that the JU is aware of the positions and views of
stakeholders from the entire hydrogen value chain, it should set up an advisory Stakeholders
Group (SG), to be consulted on horizontal issues or specific questions, as per its needs.185 For
the Clean Hydrogen JU, the SG shall consist of representatives of sectors which generate,
distribute, store, need or use clean hydrogen across the Union, including the representatives
of the of other relevant European partnerships, as well as representatives of the European
Hydrogen Valleys Interregional Partnership and of the scientific community.186 The Stakeholder
Group shall provide suggestions to enable concrete synergies to take place between the JU
and the adjacent sectors or any sector with which synergies are deemed of added value.187
Cooperation with JRC
For the Horizon 2020 period, a Framework Contract between FCH 2 JU and JRC had been
approved by the Governing Board in 2015. The scope of the Framework Contract covers the
activities provided by JRC at the level of the FCH 2 JU programme. In line with the JRC mission,
these support activities contribute primarily to the formulation and implementation of the FCH
2 JU strategy and activities in the areas of pre-normative research, RCS, safety, technology
monitoring and assessment, including, more recently, the sustainability aspects.
The JRC support activities to the FCH 2 JU programme covered by the Framework Contract
are prepared and agreed on an annual basis between the JRC and the Program Office, with
involvement of a representative of Hydrogen Europe Industry and of Hydrogen Europe
Research, and become integral part of the FCH 2 JU Annual Work Plan of the FCH 2 JU.
The present Framework Contract is valid until end of 2022. The two parts have already
expressed the intention to continue the collaboration on the same way. In 2022, the Clean
Hydrogen JU and the JRC will prepare a new Framework Contract covering the Horizon Europe
period. Its scope will cover similar activities with the previous (abovementioned) Framework
Contract, building on JRC’s experience on topics like RCS, technology monitoring, safety and
sustainability.

103Regulations, Codes and Standards (RCS) Strategy Coordination188
The implementation of suitable and hydrogen-specific regulatory and enabling frameworks is
crucial for the EU-wide deployment of hydrogen, fuel cells and hydrogen-based technologies
in order to meet the goals set out in the EU Hydrogen Strategy. Indeed, setting up these
frameworks is one of the major priorities in the first phase of the Strategy (2020-2024).
The term “Regulations, Codes and Standards” (RCS) is widely used in Europe and other
regions of the world to somehow refer to regulatory aspects in general, but it is important to
underline some few remarks on each of them, particularly within the European context.
The European Union is based on the rule of law and relies on law to ensure that its policies and
priorities are realised in the Member States.189 Regulations, directives, decisions,
recommendations, etc. are types of EU legal acts190 putting EU policies into practice.
Regulations in the EU apply automatically and uniformly to all EU countries as soon as they
enter into force, without needing to be transposed into national law. Regulations are binding in
their entirety on all EU countries and are distinguished from directives in which the latter must
be incorporated by EU countries into their national legislation. In general terms, regulations and
directives can refer to codes or standards, or be created completely on their own and, unlike a
code or a standard, a regulation does not necessarily require an industry consensus to put it in
effect. It serves to the general interest.
In the EU, the European Commission is responsible for planning, preparing and proposing new
EU laws and policies. In addition, the effective application, implementation and enforcement of
the law is a responsibility entrusted to the Commission. With regards to international regulatory
cooperation, the Commission cooperates closely with international partners, both in multilateral
dialogues, for instance with the United Nations, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development or the World Bank, as well as in bilateral dialogues.
Nevertheless, sometimes, the term “regulation” in the expression “regulation, codes and
standards” does not refer to a regulation in the sense of EU law (a directly applicable EU rule)
but to a rather technical, low-level rule, adopted by the government or a simple administration.
On the other hand, in an industrial context, a code, in general, is a set of rules or norms that
serve as generally accepted guidelines recommended for the industry to follow. They exist for
the purpose of safety, quality or another benefit. On its own, a code is not a law that must be
followed, but compliance is often a best practice. Industry codes can be voluntary or mandatory
and can be developed by the industry on its own or by public institutions. The intent of a code
is for it to apply widely across the industry within the economic sector at the scope, but can be
adopted into law, or included in a business contract.
Standards are part of the knowledge economy that underpins industry and society.191
Standards are, in essence, an agreed way of achieving a set objective. In simple terms, a
regulation or a code sets out "what" is required, and a standard sets out "how" to do it.
Standards can be used to improve safety and performance, protect consumers, workers and
188 This section does not provide detailed information on the European standardisation framework,
including the recent developments in relation to the EU Strategy on standardisation. These will be
properly reflected in a future amendment of the SRIA.
189 Article 2, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
190 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/types-eu-law_en
191 https://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Pages/default.aspx
104the environment, etc. Overall, the majority of standards are initiated by business and developed
in partnership with other stakeholders either in sectoral associations, or in Standardisation
Developing Organisations (SDOs), such as the International Standardisation Organisation
(ISO)192 and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)193 at international level, or the
European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardisation (CENELEC)194 at the European level, to name but a few. The use of standards
by market players can in addition support the implementation of public authorities’ policy and
legislation and help stakeholders to comply with legislation. For example, about 30 % of
European Standards are mandated by the European Commission in the framework of EU
legislation and perform this supplementary function195. Among the different manners to classify
standards, standards can fall into two general categories:
• Non-statutory standards: this type of standards, also named as voluntary, is generally
established by a private sector and made available to persons or organisations, whether
private or public, to use. Also considered voluntary standards are those known as
“industry standards” or “consensus standards”.
• Statutory standards. this type of standards, also named as mandatory, requires
compliance because of a European regulation or national statue, an organisation
internal policy or contractual requirement. Failure to comply with a mandatory
standard’s requirements can cause legal repercussions.
The implementation of suitable and hydrogen-specific regulatory and enabling frameworks
requires a strategic approach, which focuses, especially during the timeframe referred in the
first phase of the hydrogen strategy, on aspects where enforcement action can make a real
difference to streamline the rollout of hydrogen technologies in Europe. In this sense, the term
‘regulation’ means both legislation and other policy actions at EU and Member State level. To
this end, this approach necessitates a structured, systematic and effective coordination and
assessment of the existing gaps and barriers in the current (and upcoming) regulatory
framework in order to identify the needs and prioritise actions.
The Clean Hydrogen JU will contribute to supporting the implementation of hydrogen-specific
regulatory and enabling frameworks by a strategic and coordinated approach to RCS issues
within the Programme, which will mostly be implemented through Pre-Normative Research
activities. To this end, PNR activities will encompass research activities and desk research
activities in view of supporting RCS developments.
Whilst the Regulations, Codes and Standards Strategy Coordination (RCS SC) group196 set up
by the FCH 2 JU have certainly contributed for better coordination in the last years, in the light
of experience, these activities need an even more strategic approach in the Clean Hydrogen
JU’s Programme. To this end, a RCS SC Task Force composed of the Commission, Hydrogen
Europe and Hydrogen Europe Research, and the Clean Hydrogen JU Programme Office (PO)
will be set up.
192 https://www.iso.org
193 https://www.iec.ch
194 https://www.cencenelec.eu/
195 https://www.cencenelec.eu/STANDARDS/Pages/default.aspx
196 https://www.fch.europa.eu/page/rcs-strategy-coordination-group
105The main goal of the RCs SC Task Force will be the definition, coordination and monitoring of
the strategy related to RCS within the Programme with the ultimate goal of increasing the EU
impact in RCS development in Europe and beyond, with the main focus but not limited to
Standards. The RCS SC Task Force will support the Commission and the Member State
organisations in its activities on international regulatory cooperation when required, will ensure
the Clean Hydrogen JU will speak with one single voice and will support the synergies related
to RCS with other partnerships.
Regulatory policy is a responsibility entrusted to the Commission and Member States
organisations while the Clean Hydrogen JU can contribute to its development, the main
contribution and impact of the Programme is envisaged on supporting the development of
technical regulations. In this respect, it is important to remark that the European Union can only
act in those areas where its member countries have authorised it to do so, which makes
unrealistic the adoption of EU unified, harmonised documents valid everywhere. For example,
aspects regarding the permitting and/or licensing processes for HRS in the EU depend on local
authorities, which apply Member States rules, codes, and/or regulations.
On standards, the Programme activities will mostly focus on supporting the development as
well as the actual use of harmonised performance-based standards for hydrogen and
hydrogen-based technologies at European and international level. The goal is to provide
rigorous, fact-based and scientifically sound evidence to establish and/or further develop
standards that can be referred to in regulatory documents while facilitating the hydrogen market
deployment.
To this end, it is envisaged that RCS SC Task Force prioritises the coordination of the following
activities:
1. Follow up of RCS development related to hydrogen, fuel cells and hydrogen
technologies through a continuous global watch function with the main focus but not
limited to standards. To this end, at the request of the European Commission, the RCS
SC Task Force may explore the possibilities to support the Commission and the
Member States in the international regulatory bodies cooperation, such as with the
United Nations (e.g. with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe),
international organisations like IPHE, or bilaterally with the US, Japan, etc., and with
standardisation developing organisations at both, international and European level.
With respect to the latter, if required, the possibilities of formal liaisons could also be
explored, for instance, through participating in the Technical Advisory Boards.
2. Assessment of RCS development needs of strategic importance in Europe. Building on
the monitoring activities mentioned previously and in consultation with relevant
stakeholders, the RCS SC Task Force will assess what RCS developments could
contribute the most to foster a regulatory friction-less EU-wide hydrogen market, while
meeting the EU Hydrogen Strategy goals and the interests of the European industry
and research organisations. This will facilitate to lay down the RCS strategy in the
Programme.
3. Identification and prioritisation of the requirements and needs for research and
innovation, and coordination actions to support the RCS development identified as
strategic for Europe and that standardisation and regulatory aspects are appropriately
addressed in the Programme. The majority of the targeted actions in the Programme
will be conducted through PNR activities and will encompass but not be limited to
research activities and desk research activities in view of supporting RCS
106developments. This will contribute to the development of the Annual Work Plans of the
Clean Hydrogen JU, and will support the Annual Union Work Programme for European
standardisation when necessary.
4. Follow up and support the research and innovation, and coordination actions
undertaken in the Programme contributing to ensure to the best possible actual use of
PNR results in RCS developments. This support can encompass the establishment of
a systematic and structured approach to supporting formal liaison between SDOs and
projects, financial support to entities for participation in SDOs, etc.
5. Dissemination of results. This could include the collection and effective transfer of RCS-
relevant results in regulatory and standardisation bodies; targeted communication
actions, awareness workshops, development of training content, etc.
Altogether, the RCS SC Task Force will contribute to coordinating and establishing an approach
to enhance European participation and contribution in international and European RCS bodies
while contributing to lay down a regulatory friction-less hydrogen market in Europe and beyond
if possible.
European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)
Hydrogen is nowadays recognised as a key clean energy vector and hydrogen-based
technologies are undergoing rapid expansion across multiple applications. This is a result of
the credibility it has built up as a flexible, versatile, reliable and safe, technology.
A high degree of safety to date has been achieved through an evolving “state-of-the-art”,
identifying, understanding and solving scientific and engineering challenges in this early phase.
Nevertheless, based on the progress and expected further rapid development of hydrogen and
hydrogen-based technologies, some few key observations that will influence development in
this field moving forward and will directly impact safety need to be considered:
- Quantitative growth across “established” applications, such as private FCEVs,
electrolysers, stationary fuel cell (FC) applications, FC buses, etc., will increase the use
and demand for hydrogen, and for example increase the number and size of refuelling
stations. While there is no direct impact on each individual refuelling and/or delivery
activity, this will increase the demands on the delivery infrastructure. For the example
of FCEV refuelling, implications are increased bulk deliveries to refuelling stations,
greater utilisation of refuelling station storage, and possible requirements to build new
refuelling stations urban areas.
- Qualitative change, i.e. innovation in applications, building on the success of
established applications and recognising the inherent advantages offered by fuel cells
and hydrogen-based technologies is foreseen as an important development in the
coming years. Key elements of the new hydrogen systems, such as electrolysis or
pressure vessels, are validated and established technologies. However, the new
operational conditions and their integration into new applications with direct contact to
consumers will generate safety challenges. In the area of transport, key aspects include
the development of rail, truck and marine applications, which will have greater on-board
storage: 50-100 kg for trucks, 200-500 kg for rail, and potentially tons of hydrogen for
marine. This implies new fuelling requirements and risk profiles for these sectors.
- The inevitable consequence of this increase in consumption will be the requirement for
an increasingly large and competent workforce to enable the development to take place
107effectively and safely. Providing such service to facilitate the development is going to
put a significant number of technicians, engineers, manufacturers, regulatory authorities
etc. on a steep hydrogen learning curve.
Moreover, in the recent times there have been some “warning signs”, with hydrogen incidents
involving a hydrogen tube trailer in the USA, a hydrogen refuelling station in Norway and an
incident leading to some fatalities and several injuries involving power to gas facility in Korea.
Further accidents in more concerning scenarios, notably tunnel accidents, could become
temporary “show-stoppers” that could seriously impact short-term deployment and support for
these technologies, causing significant delays.
In this context, there is clearly a need to provide independent safety expertise, objective
information, education and training in different forms for various groups of stakeholders; and
support the anticipated upscaling of hydrogen energy applications. Besides, there is also the
need for broad information and awareness raising for society to increase the acceptance of
hydrogen.
The FCH 2 JU launched the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP) initiative197 in 2017 to
support the development and deployment of inherently safer hydrogen systems and
infrastructure, contributing to achieving the following vision: “hydrogen and fuel cell
technologies shall be safely developed, safely introduced, and safety used in projects as well
as in the wider society”.
To achieve this vision, the EHSP activities started in the FCH 2 JU will continue and will be
reinforced in the Clean Hydrogen JU. The EHSP is initially envisaged as a multidisciplinary pool
of experts grouped in ad-hoc working groups (task forces) according to the tasks to be
performed and to expertise. Collectively, the members of the EHSP will have the necessary
scientific competencies and expertise covering the technical domain needed to make science-
based recommendations to the Clean Hydrogen JU. In any case, different working
arrangements will be explored in order to assess how the EHSP activities could be best suited
to maximise its contribution to the Programme and in the last instance, its impact.
The mission of the EHSP in the Programme will be twofold:
• To assist the Clean Hydrogen JU at both programme and project levels, in assuring that
hydrogen safety is adequately addressed and managed, and
• To promote and disseminate hydrogen safety knowledge and culture within and outside
of the Programme.
Sharing information, coordinating and contributing to addressing the above-mentioned
challenges will be the critical role for the EHSP as a focal point or “safety advisor” to the
Programme. To this end, it is envisaged that EHSP prioritises the following themes for its
activities:
1. Awareness: Increased awareness of the hazards associated with hydrogen energy
systems, and the measures required to reduce the inherent risk of such systems to a
tolerable level. This includes increased understanding of concepts such as hazards and
risk, and the importance of assessing the knowledge available for risk assessments, as
well as quantifying the inherent uncertainty in risk assessments, especially for emerging
197 https://www.fch.europa.eu/page/european-hydrogen-safety-panel
108technologies.
2. Foresight: Understanding developing and future technologies in terms of innovation,
implementation, operation and safety. Evidence suggests progress will be rapid and it
is essential that safety does not become a barrier nor undermine the future of hydrogen
technologies. By working closely with the Clean Hydrogen JU’s full spectrum of
stakeholders, the EHSP will be able to maximise the effectiveness and impact of the
state of the art to anticipate safety challenges and solutions.
3. Collaboration: As already illustrated for the state-of-the-art to date, collaboration is
essential. To maximise safety and development of the future state-of-the-art this
collaboration must continue. Strategies to reinforce the impact of collaboration with
European and international stakeholders will be deployed.
4. Public outreach: Sharing lessons learnt and formulating recommendations, knowledge
and best practice for safety is clearly an important part of improving the state-of-the-art
in hydrogen safety and accidents. However, in light of the recent incidents mentioned
above, an argument can be made that with the rapid expansion of hydrogen systems
and infrastructure, this activity needs even greater attention. It is fundamental to ensure
that such incidents are prevented, or at least that the consequences are reduced as far
as possible through inherently safe or robust design and appropriate mitigating
measures. Lessons learnt from accidents should be properly analysed and made
available for all relevant stakeholders. With the widespread use of hydrogen in society,
a growing fraction of the general population will be exposed to potential hazards. As
such, the risk picture is about to change dramatically, as the technology is transferred
from highly trained and knowledgeable experts in controlled industrial environments to
the general public. The EHSP can play an important role in this transition.
5. Exploitation: Funding from the EU and other sources internationally have resulted in
achievements in a number of areas related to hydrogen safety. It is important to analyse
the progress and identify knowledge that can inform quantitative risk analysis and
industrial practice. The EHSP could contribute to guide and direct the international
community to the exploitable outcome from previous achievements.
Altogether, the EHSP will contribute to coordinating and establishing approaches to address
hydrogen safety-related matters in Europe, while contributing to promoting a hydrogen safety
culture and a safe hydrogen market in Europe and beyond if possible.
European Hydrogen Sustainability and Circularity Panel (EHS&CP)
One of the key aspects for the development of our society is sustainability, ensuring the
protection of the environment, the economic feasibility looking at creating new job opportunities,
and the social responsibility taking into account Social and Intergenerational Equity. In 2015,
the United Nations adopted 17 SDGs, aiming at “transforming our world” by ending poverty,
protecting the planet, and ensuring that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. One of
them, Goal 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production – calls for efficient management of
natural resources, reducing waste and promoting recycling. As part of the sustainable
development agenda, the "2030 Agenda"198, all countries are committed to developing
strategies to build economic growth and address a range of social needs while tackling climate
198 https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda
109change and environmental sustainability.
In the EU, sustainable development is a core principle of the Treaty on European Union and a
key objective for the Union’s internal and external policies199. Indeed, the EU is firmly committed
to delivering on the UN’s SDGs through several policies and initiatives200. In the area of climate
and energy, sustainable development is at the heart of the European Green Deal201, which
along with other policies202 has set the EU on a course to become a sustainable climate-neutral
and circular economy by 2050.
Building a circular economy means reducing its carbon and material footprint, stimulating
sustainable consumption and production patterns while bringing significant new jobs and
growth potential. Circular economy is about doing more and better with less. It also aims at
reducing the environmental impact by minimising waste and excessive resource use throughout
value chains and production processes, for example by turning goods at the end of their lifespan
into resources for others through re-use, re-manufacture and recycle, trying to reflect natural
ecosystems.
Circularity is an essential part of a wider transformation of the European industry towards
climate neutrality and long-term competitiveness, representing one of the key building blocks
of the New Industrial Strategy for Europe203 and the Recovery Plan for Europe204. The first
Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) was adopted by the Commission in 2015205, establishing
concrete actions covering the whole products life cycle: from extraction and transformation of
raw materials to advanced materials and components, to waste management and the
production of secondary raw materials. Building on the CEAP, in 2018 the Commission adopted
the circular economy package, which included among others the development of a monitoring
framework for the circular economy206 and a report on critical raw materials and the circular
economy207. In 2020, the Commission has adopted the new CEAP208, which represents
Europe’s new agenda for future sustainable growth. The new action plan includes initiatives
along the entire life cycle of products aiming to reduce the pressure on natural resources,
promote circular economy processes and encourage sustainable consumption.
The linear economy is based on linear processes that rely on the abundant and infinite
availability of raw materials at a relatively low cost, and endless waste sinks. The typical linear
system consists of a series of steps – resource extraction, manufacturing, consuming, and
disposing of products at the end of their life cycle- almost without any interaction among them.
However, the Earth’s resources are limited and the depletion of raw materials is inevitable
without sustainable development. On the other side, demand for raw materials is projected to
double by 2050203, making sustainable sourcing essential to increase Europe’s security of
supply. Indeed, among the main environmental reasons towards a circular economy are
resource scarcity, particularly for strategic resources, the volatility of (and rising) commodity

110prices, and negative environmental impacts of unsustainable production and consumption.
Reliable and unhindered access to certain raw materials is a growing concern within the EU.
The strategic importance of securing the supply of raw materials was also recognised by the
EU Green Deal to fulfil its ambition to become climate-neutral by 2050 based on the use of
several raw materials in strategic areas such as batteries, renewable energies, hydrogen,
digital applications, etc.209
The EU is addressing this challenge through the Raw Materials Initiative210, which defines the
strategic policy framework to secure a sustainable supply of raw materials for Europe. As part
of this initiative, the Commission is monitoring the EU’s resilience in relation to raw materials
and reviews the list of critical raw materials (CRMs) for the EU every three years based on their
importance to the EU economy and of the high risk associated with their supply. The most
recent assessment published in 2020 identified 30 CRMs211, more than double compared to
the CRMs list from 2011.
Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies will play an essential role in the sustainable transition and
future energy system. Nevertheless, the hydrogen technologies value chains are under
development and need further development to become an environmentally sustainable, socially
responsible and circular market value proposition. Overall, the European hydrogen sector is
based on a linear economy approach and further efforts are still required to minimise the
impacts of these technologies from their design, manufacturing and deployment, to ensuring
their recovery, reuse, and recycling or disposal.
With regard to the upstream supply chain, around 30 raw materials are needed for producing
and storage of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies212. Of these materials, 13 materials namely
cobalt, magnesium, REEs, platinum, palladium, borates, silicon metal, rhodium, ruthenium,
graphite, lithium, titanium, and vanadium are deemed critical for the EU economy according to
the 2020 CRM list. China is the major supplier of these raw materials with more than 20%
share, followed by South Africa and Russia.
The fuel cell industry relies heavily on platinum-based catalysts, with platinum making up about
half of the cost of a fuel cell stack. Apart from the platinum group metals (PGM), major growth
in demand is expected also for copper for use in fuel cell electric vehicles. Platinum is produced
mainly in South Africa (71% of global production), followed by Russia (16%) and Zimbabwe
(6%). Boosting recycling and the use of secondary raw materials will help reduce this
dependency.
The rapid growth of clean hydrogen produced by water electrolysis using renewable energy will
lead to high demand for nickel, zirconium, rare earth elements (i.e. lanthanum and yttrium) and
PGM (i.e. platinum, palladium and iridium) used in various types of electrolysers.213 Scarce raw
materials such as iridium and platinum can represent a barrier to industrial scale up of PEM
electrolysers and reducing their cost (e.g. the current production of iridium and platinum will
only support an estimated 3-7.5 GW annual manufacturing capacity of PEM electrolysers,
compared to an estimated annual manufacturing requirement of around 100 GW by 2030).214

111Diversifying supply chains, fostering technology innovation, and improve resource efficiency
and circularity are potential solutions to increase the EU’s resilience in relation to raw materials
used in hydrogen technologies (notably on electrolysers and fuel cells). The EU can lead the
way towards a sustainable and circular hydrogen economy. Innovation and technological
progress are key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges,
including access to resources and sustainability. Indeed, in line with the European Green Deal
objectives, research and innovation activities should not make significant harm to any of the six
environmental objectives (EU Taxonomy regulation215), and should follow the “Do No
Significant Harm” principle.
The Clean Hydrogen JU is committed to contributing to putting the EU hydrogen sector at the
forefront of the sustainable and circular transition of hydrogen technologies and their associated
value chains. To this end, the research and innovation actions included in particular within the
sections “Sustainability, LCSA, recycling and eco-design” and “Supply Chain” will play a key
role in providing the methodological foundation to strengthen the sustainability and circularity
of these technologies and their industrial value chains in Europe. Nevertheless, the transition
towards a fully-fledged sustainable and circular hydrogen economy requires an integrated
approach beyond these activities. To this end, the Clean Hydrogen JU will set up a European
Hydrogen Sustainability and Circularity Panel (EHS&CP) at the Programme level.
The Sustainability and Circularity Panel will support the Clean Hydrogen JU Programme in the
transition towards a sustainable and circular hydrogen economy. The EHS&CP is envisaged
as a multidisciplinary pool of experts (10-15 experts approx.) with knowledge and experience
in the relevant areas, covering the technical domain needed to make science-based
recommendations to the Clean Hydrogen JU. They will act as a focal point or “advisor” to the
Programme in these matters in an independent, coordinated and consolidated way.
The mission of the EHS&CP in the Programme will be two-fold:
• To assist the Clean Hydrogen JU in assuring that sustainability and circularity aspects
are adequately addressed and managed at both programme and project levels,
encompassing environmental, social and economic aspects as a whole, and
• To promote and disseminate knowledge and a more sustainable and circular culture
within and beyond the Programme.
To this end, the scope of the activities of the EHS&CP is preliminary envisaged around three
main areas.
Support at programme and project levels
The EHS&CP will provide advice for developing an overarching and comprehensive strategy
on sustainability and circularity at the Programme level. To this end, the EHS&CP will define
and coordinate a package of measures to raise the sustainability and circularity of the projects
by integrating learnings, expertise and planning with respect to sustainability and circularity so
that the DNSH principle is taken into consideration in the Programme as a whole. This could
include the provision of specific guidelines on sustainability and circularity measures in projects,
strengthening the impacts and influence of the R&I actions undertaken in the cross-cutting
issues and supply chain areas across the Programme, and proposing new methodologies and
tools to ensure actual sustainable and circular systems.
215 Regulation (EU) 2020/852
112Data collection and assessment
In this regard, the EHS&CP tasks may include the coordination and development of a
systematic data collection approach to extract valuable information from projects to provide
further guidance to both projects and the Clean Hydrogen JU based on a regular monitoring
activity. This could include the development of sustainability and circularity indicators to monitor
progress and a better understanding of environmental and social impacts of products and
services, identifying “hot spots” within the value chains where interventions have the greatest
potential to improve the sustainability and circularity, providing data and knowledge to make
informed decisions, etc.
Public outreach
Framed within the context of the intended broad information, activities in this category may
include the development of newsletters, set up events and a regularly updated webpage,
containing for example lessons learned and links to other important hydrogen-sustainable and
circular-related information.
Altogether, the EHS&CP will provide the Clean Hydrogen JU a unique, practical and direct
support to reach the following objective: ensure that the sustainability and circularity
considerations are taken into account in the development and implementation of research and
innovation actions and are embedded in the Programme as a whole, integrating and balancing
the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental.
Knowledge management
(Current) Knowledge activities in previous JUs
Knowledge management refers to a range of practices and techniques used by organisations
to create, share and exploit knowledge to achieve organisational goals. The predecessor FCH
2 JU, being at the centre of creation of knowledge for fuel cell and hydrogen technologies, has
been implementing knowledge management activities since its beginning.
The initial focus of these activities was to improve technology monitoring. Initially based on the
TEMONAS tool developed under FCH JU216, technologies began to be monitored in a more
structured way, assisting in measuring the progress of the research & innovation and innovation
activities of FCH 2 JU Key Performance Indicators (KPI). TEMONAS was subsequently
replaced by the platform TRUST217, developed in 2017, which was at the heart of a more
elaborate annual data collection exercise from the FCH 2 JU projects. The findings of the data
collection exercise were presented in the annual Programme Review Report, focusing mainly
on the added value, effectiveness and techno-economic efficiency of FCH 2 JU projects.
Parallel to the development of TRUST, the knowledge management activities expanded
beyond technology monitoring. The FCH 2 JU website has provided already detailed
information on projects, while an internal database following the deployment of fuel cell and
hydrogen deployment was developed and maintained. The collaboration with JRC on
knowledge management activities, dating back to FCH JU, was strengthened further, both via
the development of the Tools for Innovation Monitoring (TIM) database218, the preparation and
216 https://www.fch.europa.eu/project/technology-monitoring-and-assessment
217 TRUST data collection methodology, FCH
218 https://www.fch.europa.eu/page/tools-innovation-monitoring-tim
113publication of reports on the developments in specific technological areas and by supporting
the Programme Office on mapping the international state-of-the-art for the various technologies
and benchmarking FCH JU activities against it. Moreover, on 15 September 2020, there was
the launch of the Fuel Cell Hydrogen Observatory, providing data and up to date information
about the entire hydrogen sector. It focuses on technology and market statistics, socio-
economic indicators, policy and regulation, as well as financial support.
Clean Hydrogen as the Knowledge Hub for Hydrogen in Europe
The Clean Hydrogen JU will build on the wide range of activities and experience acquired so
far by the predecessors JUs, further developing them in order for the Clean Hydrogen JU to
better accomplish its objectives and improve its operations. In particular, the main goals of the
Clean Hydrogen JU knowledge activities and in close co-operation with the European
Commission and the Industry will be:
1. Support the collection and diffusion of high quality new knowledge;
2. Contribute to the implementation of the European Clean Hydrogen Strategy;
3. Strengthen the knowledge capacity of hydrogen value chain actors through data
collection and knowledge collection;
4. Support evidence-based implementation of Union policies;
5. Monitor progress towards the achievement of the objectives of the Clean Hydrogen JU
objectives and its technology KPI;
6. Improve Clean Hydrogen JU’s operational and planning capacity;
The ultimate goal of this Strategy is to gradually turn the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking
into the Knowledge Hub for Hydrogen in Europe, and the Programme Office into a knowledge
intensive organisation.
The strategy for turning the Clean Hydrogen JU into a hydrogen Knowledge Hub will be based
on the following pillars:
Annual Data Collection Exercise and Programme Review Report
The annual data collection exercise, monitoring the progress towards the technology KPI
targets, and the Programme Review report, presenting the findings of the exercise, have proven
to be very successful and will be continued as a main source of knowledge for the successor
of FCH 2 JU. An effort will be made to reduce the duration of the exercise, starting from 2021,
bringing the reporting period forward and enriching the report with more information valuable
to its readers.
Monitoring hydrogen technologies across EU programmes and partnerships
The Clean Hydrogen JU is mandated to keep the key competence knowledge for hydrogen and
fuel cell technology. Hydrogen topics (and related projects) are addressed in various EU
programmes and partnerships under Horizon Europe. The Clean Hydrogen JU will examine
ways to monitor and assess technology progress and deployment for all these projects,
integrating this information in one EU hydrogen database. The ultimate goal would be that all
projects relevant to hydrogen participate in the Clean Hydrogen JU’s annual data collection
exercise, thus providing an up to date and complete database of the output from all European
funded projects.
114Knowledge Management Tools
The Programme Office will continue to use and further develop the tools used in FCH 2 JU to
collect and monitor information, most notably the data collection platform TRUST and the TIM
tool developed by JRC. These will be complemented by the tools provided by DG RTD
(CORDA, COMPASS, CORTEX, etc), as well as the databases and tools developed internally
to better manage information for supporting the operations of the Programme Office.
As all the above-mentioned tools are independent and accessed separately, it is envisaged
that a new knowledge management tool should be introduced, either replacing or integrating
the existing tools and further enhancing their capacity. Such a tool would include, in the same
platform, a data collection tool (which could also be TRUST), an extended database fed by
many different sources, analysis capabilities and strong reporting and visualisation capabilities.
Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Observatory (FCHO)
The FCHO shall remain as the main portal for European hydrogen data. Considering the
development of similar observatories and knowledge hubs by other international organisations,
there will be initiatives to collaborate with them.
At the same time FCHO will be further populated with data, aiming to fill in current knowledge
gaps. Data quality controls shall be further enhanced, to ensure FCHO provides a robust set of
data, allowing it to become the reference point for European hydrogen data.
Clean Hydrogen JU website
The Clean Hydrogen JU website will be enriched with more information concerning the Clean
Hydrogen JU’s projects, technology developments, etc. Combined with FCHO, the two
websites should become a one stop shop for all information related to clean hydrogen in
Europe.
Feedback to Policy
The JU will identify and report, in line with the common policy feedback framework and with
strategies and actions to support the European Green Deal objectives, the relevant knowledge
acquired from the management of research and innovation projects and their results to the
Commission to serve as input for monitoring, evaluating and rectifying, where necessary,
existing policy measures or shaping new policy initiatives and decisions.
Moreover, it will provide the Commission with the necessary technical, scientific and
administrative support to carry out its tasks for the purposes of ensuring the proper functioning
and development in the Union of the hydrogen sector.
Support from JRC
JRC will continue being an important partner to the Clean Hydrogen JU, supporting all
knowledge activities, as described in Section 4.1.1.
Co-operation in terms of knowledge management with Member States and Hydrogen Valleys
Co-operation with Member States and Hydrogen Valleys will be vital in ensuring the Knowledge
Hub goal of the Clean Hydrogen JU. There will be significant mutual benefits by exchanging
information on hydrogen activities and technology developments. Moreover, the Clean
Hydrogen JU will provide the opportunity to the Member States and Hydrogen Valleys to
present more widely their activities, mainly through the State Representative Group (SRG) and
the European Research Area (ERA). To achieve this, it will also be useful to develop links with
115the associated organisations, in charge of implementing national hydrogen strategies. The
Hydrogen Valley Platform,219 co-funded by FCH 2 JU and Mission Innovation, will be further
developed to foster exchange of know-how and best practices at the European and
international level.
Targeted studies/roadmaps
The knowledge spectrum shall be complemented with studies, focusing on the areas where
gaps are identified. One particular area where studies will be required, mandated by the SBA220,
concern the assessment and monitoring of technological, economic and societal barriers to
market entry, including in emerging hydrogen markets.
Sharing public data, while guarding confidential data
The Clean Hydrogen JU is accumulating significant knowledge from its projects and activities,
sharing of which could benefit the whole hydrogen community. Considering the increasing
interest in hydrogen related technology data, the Clean Hydrogen JU will investigate ways to
make non-confidential technology and deployment data from hydrogen projects increasingly
available to the stakeholders and public, complementing the ones available via FCHO. At the
same time it will continue guarding all confidential data, as declared by the beneficiaries of its
funding, protecting the trust relationship built between the partnership and its beneficiaries.
Dissemination & Exploitation of the project results
Hydrogen is currently gaining more and more attention, its visibility increased significantly since
2019. The Clean Hydrogen JU will play a key role in strengthening and closely monitoring the
dissemination of the results/outcomes of hydrogen projects, as well as the exploitation of their
results.
Efficient and pro-active dissemination activities are of great importance for the success of the
Clean Hydrogen JU, with objectives to:
• Ensure that the Clean Hydrogen JU is perceived as the key European strategic initiative
for focused, coordinated and competitive innovation activities in the field of clean
hydrogen;
• Raise awareness of the role of clean hydrogen in creating a sustainable, secure and
affordable energy system, while at the same time increasing EU competitiveness and
contributing to job creation;
• Ensure internal interaction and coordination with members and stakeholders managing
their expectations and promoting continued interest in the Clean Hydrogen JU activities
speaking with one voice;
• Engage external stakeholders to encourage increased innovation investment in clean
hydrogen technologies.
Dissemination & Exploitation (D&E) Tools/Services
All dissemination and communication activities will be in line with the European Commission’s
strategies for dissemination and exploitation of the projects results in Horizon Europe.
According to the governance of D&E Strategy for the post-H2020 period and the Horizon
219 https://www.h2v.eu/hydrogen-valleys
220 See Article 74 (a) of the SBA.
116Europe, the governance structure for implementation will consist of the following coordination
groups (which will replace the former D&E Network configuration and its six Working Groups):
• The Horizon Dissemination & Exploitation Group, and
• The Horizon Feedback to Policy Group.
Also the D&E Action Plan 2021 – 2022 aims to create a D&E ecosystem for R&I results, in
which all main actors (e.g. beneficiaries, EU policy makers, investors, social entrepreneurs,
national and regional administrations, etc.) will be contributing to and benefiting from a dynamic
circulation of knowledge stemming from R&I projects. A non-exhaustive list of already existing
services and tools, parts of the EC D&E ecosystem follows:
1. Horizon Results Platform221: A result-oriented platform for project beneficiaries to upload
their results, to valorise and promote them to the targeted groups (e.g. business
partners, angel investors, venture capitals, policy makers, business development
assistance etc);
2. Innovation Radar222: A European Commission initiative to identify high potential
innovations and innovators in EU-funded research and innovation projects, based on a
data driven method;
3. Horizon Results Booster223: A package of tailor-made specialised services to maximise
the impact of R&I public investment and further amplify the added value of the
Programme, by building the capacity of projects for disseminating research results,
increasing their potential for exploitation and improving access to markets;
4. Dealflow.eu224: Mainly addressed to innovations analysed by the Innovation Radar, this
package of services aims to support EU-funded start-ups in commercialising their
innovations and connect them with investors and corporates (fundraising, venture
building and networking).
5. IP Booster225: Specialised professional Intellectual Property service for public research
organisations looking to realise value from their research results;
6. Open Research Europe226: The new EC scientific publishing service for fast publication
and open peer review for research scientific articles stemming from H2020 projects.
Also, 1000 Solutions227, an initiative of the Solar Impulse foundation to grant a Solar Impulse
Efficient Solution Label to 1000 products, processes or services that meet high standards of
both sustainability and profitability, can be an additional platform for the Clean Hydrogen JU to
disseminate the projects results.
These tools and services are expected to improve the dissemination of information within and
beyond the hydrogen community, and to enable further exploitation of the project results and a
larger impact of the Clean Hydrogen JU on European society.

117Programme Review Days
The Clean Hydrogen JU will organise annually the Program Review Days as part of the
Hydrogen Week event, a major opportunity to raise visibility on Clean Hydrogen JU activities
and to assess projects and innovation pillars, as well as ultimately its Programme development,
especially in relation to international developments. Support material produced and provided
parallel to the event for D&E purposes consists of:
1. The publishable version of the Programme Review Report, presenting briefly the major
developments in each panel and the non-confidential major outcomes of the active
projects, and
2. The Success Stories, a portfolio of narratives that highlight the most prominent
achievements of a single project or a cluster of projects and the progress they make.
Additionally, the Clean Hydrogen JU will also upgrade existing tools already used in the
previous period to support D&E activities in program level, mainly through the new upgraded
website in which the project results will continue to be published. These type of tools/activities
are presented in Section 4.6.2 of this document.
The role of small and medium-sized enterprises
Small and medium-sized enterprises are an important source of innovation and represent a
large share of companies engaged in early markets, involved in many industrial supply chains.
Their role is crucial for future commercialisation and are best placed to take advantage of the
opportunities offered by new technologies and grow by creating new jobs requiring advanced
skills. This is possible through adapting existing methods as well as through novel methods of
production.
The hydrogen sector includes a series of highly successful SMEs that have developed products
and are eager to move to massive large-scale manufacturing to enable cost reductions and
market penetration to match the growing demand. This allows them to grow successful
businesses and position themselves strongly within the hydrogen supply chain.
The predecessors JUs haves been a key instrument for SMEs, providing a stable regulatory
environment as well as the long-term stability that comes with public sector funding. Working
alongside larger companies in the same field enables SMEs to tap into the expertise,
distribution networks, support and customer pools of those organisations. Through financial
and networking support, FCH and FCh 2 JUs have helped many SMEs in the fuel cell and
hydrogen sectors to achieve their business goals, from obtaining private investment to the
marketing of new products and services. There are plenty of successful SME beneficiaries in
the areas of electrolysis, gasification of biomass and biowaste and the development of
hydrogen carriers.
The Clean Hydrogen JU will continue to rely on the innovativeness of SMEs. To do this, it will
need to deal with two of the largest obstacles that SMEs must overcome, the need to raise
financing, especially in the early stages of growth, and to kick-start sales and thereby gain
valuable field experience. In order to address the specific limitations and risks of SMEs, the
Clean Hydrogen JU will continue to explore ways to open access to the necessary
manufacturing and process capabilities through partnership schemes and education initiatives.
It will help raise awareness of projects’ results within the finance community, while at the same
time trying to address the private sector funding and financing challenge that acts as a market
118barrier for deployment of hydrogen technologies and wider hydrogen integrated solutions.
In parallel, the JU will promote the involvement of SMEs and start-ups in its activities and ensure
the provision of timely information to them, in line with the objectives of Horizon Europe and the
SBA, by implementing measures for attracting newcomers (see also Section 5.2).
International cooperation strategy
The recent Communication of the European Commission on the global approach to research
and innovation228 presents the EU’s new strategy on international cooperation on research and
innovation. The EU aims to take a leading role in supporting international research and
innovation partnerships and to deliver innovative solutions for making our societies green,
digital and healthy.
The strategy builds on two principal objectives: preserving openness in international research
and innovation cooperation, while promoting a level playing field and reciprocity underpinned
by fundamental values. To achieve its goals, the EU will embark on several actions,
implemented through EU bilateral cooperation and pooling global efforts to tackle global
challenges. It will modulate cooperation with priority countries and region, by:
• Strengthening cooperation with industrialised non-EU countries and emerging
economies;
• Giving particular priority to partners in its immediate vicinity, including through
association to Horizon Europe;
• Deepening EU partnerships with Africa, Latin America and other regions and countries.
Examples of such cooperation include the support of researchers and their organisations to
help accelerate sustainable and inclusive development in low and middle-income countries229,
as well as leading international efforts in climate and environmental science towards a just
green transition.
The Clean Hydrogen JU will support the Commission in the endeavour, in accordance with its
objectives under Articles 4, 5 and 73 of the SBA, as well as the additional tasks described under
Article 74. In particular, the SBA calls for the Clean Hydrogen JU to:
1. Contribute to the objectives set out in the 2030 Climate Target Plan, which foresee
actions on the international dimension. In particular, the European Commission will seek
mutually beneficial alliances around new sustainable technologies, such as renewable
hydrogen, and using EU’s cooperation platforms230 for the deployment of international
environmental standards and promotion of clean technologies through trade. Following
the Commission’s request, the Clean Hydrogen JU could potentially support the
Commission in these actions;
2. Support the Commission, including through technical expertise, in its international
initiatives on the hydrogen strategy, such as the International Partnership for Hydrogen
Economy (IPHE) and fuel cells in the Economy, Mission Innovation (and notably the
228 Europe’s strategy for international cooperation in a changing world, COM(2021) 252 final.
229 Including through an ambitious ‘Africa initiative’ under Horizon Europe, to strengthen cooperation
with African countries.
230 Notably the ‘Hydrogen Mission’ with Australia, Chile, Germany and the UK, launched at the Mission
Innovation 2.0 conference in June 2021.
119Clean Hydrogen Mission) and the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) Hydrogen Initiative;
3. Notwithstanding the Commission’s policy prerogatives, under the Commission’s policy
guidance and supervision, contribute to the development of regulations and standards
with the view to eliminating barriers to market entry and to supporting interchangeability,
inter-operability, and trade across the internal market and globally;
4. Strengthen international cooperation in support of Union policy objectives and
international commitments.
In order to meet these objectives, the Clean Hydrogen JU will support the European
Commission in the implementation of its international cooperation agenda in research and
innovation.
It will support the Commission on possible links with major deployment programmes globally of
hydrogen technologies, continue to support the Commission in the work on standards and
regulations harmonisation, as well as to accelerate the market uptake of these technologies.
Under the Commission’s policy guidance and supervision, the Regulations, Codes and
Standards Strategy Coordination group and the Sustainability and Circularity Panel, described
in more detail in Sections 4.3 and 4.5, will support the Commission in its activities on
international cooperation when required. The European Hydrogen Safety Panel, presented in
Section 4.4, will continue and expand its collaboration with European and international
stakeholders in order to maximise safety and development of the future state-of-the-art.
The Clean Hydrogen JU will continue to provide technical support to the European Commission
on its international activities in relation to hydrogen research and innovation, as well as promote
its Calls for Proposals intended for international cooperation. The main envisaged support to
the Commission relate to the IPHE, the Clean Energy Ministerial Hydrogen Initiative, Mission
Innovation 2.0 and Hydrogen Energy Ministerial.
For the purpose of the IPHE, the Clean Hydrogen JU can support the European Commission
in the current and forthcoming working groups, such as Standards, Education and Certification,
as well as support with technical expertise the European Commission in the Steering Group. In
addition, the Clean Hydrogen JU will continue to support the European Commission in providing
periodical updates on hydrogen activities at EU level to the IPHE.
In the context of the Clean Energy Ministerial Hydrogen Initiative, the Clean Hydrogen JU will
support the European Commission with technical expertise in the different tasks the
Commission either co-leads or participates, such as enabling deployment of hydrogen
technologies in transport (e.g. ports) and identification of national targets and definition of
Global Aspirational goals for hydrogen.
Following the successful and close collaboration of the FCH 2 JU with EC representatives on
the Mission Innovation – IC8 and the setting up of the Hydrogen Valley Platform, a platform for
exchanges between worldwide initiatives on hydrogen valleys, the Clean Hydrogen JU will
continue to contribute in this direction. It will maintain and further improve the Hydrogen Valleys
platform, while the Clean Hydrogen JU will support the European Commission in its co-lead
activities.
Similarly, the Clean Hydrogen JU PO will continue to support JRC by contributing to the
Commission activities for the International Energy Agency (IEA) Hydrogen Technology
Collaboration Programme (HTCP) executive committee. More specifically, it was agreed for the
Clean Hydrogen JU to follow the newly created tasks on Renewable H2 production,
120Underground Hydrogen Storage and Hydrogen Export Value Chains, in addition to ongoing IEA
HIA Task 41 on Analysis and Modelling of Hydrogen Technologies. Moreover, the Clean
Hydrogen JU PO may provide expertise upon request to the IEA Advanced Fuel Cells TCP.
In terms of knowledge management activities, the Clean Hydrogen JU will will seek to sign
mutually beneficially cooperation agreements on the sharing of knowledge and the exchange
of data with international energy organisations active in the area of hydrogen, such as the
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the World Energy Council and IEA, while
keeping the EC and the JRC fully informed.
In view of assisting in the implementation of the International Cooperation Strategy of the
Commission, the Clean Hydrogen JU may be involved at the Commission’s request in different
actions. In terms of strengthening EUs cooperation with Africa, it can provide technical
assistance in terms of future hydrogen usage, production and export potentials, that could
enable their green energy transition.
At the same time, the co-operation with our industrialised partners, especially the ones sharing
a similar vision with EU for hydrogen, is essential. In these cases one could envisage more
formal co-operation with bodies similar to the Clean Hydrogen JU, promoting research and
innovation in hydrogen, as well as activities such as education and training, public awareness
and RCS, through e.g. joint events, webinars, roadshows, exchange of expertise. In particular,
the Clean Hydrogen JU, through its PO upon GB validation, intends to build on the long-term
cooperation of the FCH JU with US DOE / EERE, METI / NEDO (Japan) and NRCan (Canada),
but also develop relations, as necessary, with other countries and regions according to EU’s
international cooperation agreements. On an annual basis, the JU will take stock of these
activities, summarising them in a report submitted to the Governing Board.
Communication
Communication has become increasingly important and ambitious, in an environment that is
keen to absorb increasing amounts of information about the hydrogen technologies. It forms a
key element of the partnership activities; moreover, it is included as one of the specific
objectives of the partnership.
The communication policy of the Clean Hydrogen JU will focus on the following objectives:
• Position the partnership as an important factor in the development of the hydrogen
technologies sector and a key partner to achieve the targets of the EU Green Deal.
Communication will raise the profile of the Clean Hydrogen JU as being the key European
strategic initiative for focused, coordinated and competitive research activities in the field of
hydrogen technologies.
• Build public awareness and acceptance of the hydrogen technologies
Communication and dissemination activities will contribute towards building a strong societal
and political support for the development and uptake of the hydrogen technologies.
• Ensure communication towards and between key stakeholders
Cooperation with other European partnerships under Horizon Europe will be key for building
the public awareness and political support for the technology. Communication will benefit from
building synergies and establishing strong links with the projects, the members of the
partnerships , and other initiatives and networks – at European and global level, such as the
121Horizon Europe NCP network.
• Inform about the funding opportunities facilitated by the partnership and about the
results of the projects and initiatives
Present and promote the results of the projects funded by the partnership. Attract relevant and
varied types of beneficiaries for developing innovative, successful projects.
The details of JU’s Comunciation Policy can be found separately in the relevant document.231
231 The Communication Policy will be adopted separately by the GB.
1225. Programme implementation
Budget
The budget of the Clean Hydrogen JU shall be formed of contributions from the Union and its
members other than the Union – namely Hydrogen Europe and Hydrogen Europe Research.
The contributions to the joint undertaking shall cover administrative and operational costs up to
the maximum amounts specified in Part III of the SBA under Articles 76 and 77. The Union
contribution may be increased with contributions from third countries associated with Horizon
Europe provided that the total amount by which the Union contribution is increased is at least
matched by the contribution of members other than the Union, or their constituent or affiliated
entities.232 Additionally the budget may be complemented through additional Union funds,
corresponding to additional tasks entrusted to a joint undertaking, which shall not be accounted
for in the calculation of the Union maximum financial contribution.233
The administrative costs shall not exceed EUR 60 386 000; it shall be covered by financial
contributions on an annual basis, divided equally between the Union and the private Members.
If part of the contribution for administrative costs is not used, it may be made available for the
operational activities of the Clean Hydrogen JU. Administrative costs will cover administrative
expenditures such as staff costs, rental of building, equipment, IT equipment and maintenance,
evaluation costs, meetings, etc.
The operational costs of the Clean Hydrogen JU will be covered through the financial
contribution from the Union (EUR 969 807 000, not including contributions from third countries),
and through in kind contributions (consisting of the eligible costs incurred in implementing
indirect actions less the EU contribution) by Members other than the Union. The EU contribution
is approximately 30% less than the requested budget by the private members to achieve the
objectives of SRIA-HE/HER. Nevertheless, the SRIA retains the ambitiousness of the SRIA-
HE/HER in term of activities and related objectives, under the understanding that certain
prioritising may need to be implemented over the seven years. Therefore, not all activities
described in this document may be performed by the Clean Hydrogen JU without the additional
required contributions to the Clean Hydrogen JU budget.
For the implementation of the budget, in accordance with the Legislative Financial Statement
accompanying the SBA, the Clean Hydrogen JU will conclude a Delegation Agreement, as well
as annual Transfer of Funds agreements with the European Commission234. Financing
Agreements with its private Members will be concluded for their contribution to administrative
budget.
In order to achieve its objectives, the Clean Hydrogen JU shall provide financial support mainly
in the form of grants to participants following open and competitive Calls for proposals. At least
10% of budget should be implemented through activities at low TRL.
232 Article 10(2) of SBA.
233 Article 10 paragraphs (4)-(6) of SBA.
234 In accordance with the latest instructions from the Commission, the Delegation Agreement referred
to in the Legislative Financial Statement will take the form of a Financial Framework Partnership
Agreement (FFPA) and the Transfer of Funds agreements will take the form of Contribution
Agreements.
123Conditions for participation and eligibility for funding
Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, or international organisation may
participate in indirect actions funded under the Clean Hydrogen JU Programme, provided that
the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation have been met together with any
specific conditions laid down in the work programme or call.
In line with the Horizon Europe Regulation235, one of the Clean Hydrogen JU objectives is to
increase commitments and contributions in a qualitative and quantitative manner in order to
demonstrate the added value and directionality of the partnership, while keeping transparency
and openness as regards the identification of priorities and objectives, and the involvement of
partners and stakeholders from different sectors. Private members should, therefore, make a
substantial share of their contributions at the level of indirect actions funded by the Clean
Hydrogen JU. In order for the private partners to deliver their in-kind contributions to operational
activities and to additional activities, and considering that both contributions can only be made
by the constituent entities of the private members236, the Clean Hydrogen JU should encourage
such membership.
The establishment of a Joint Undertaking ensures a mutually beneficial public-private
partnership for the members involved, including the promotion of certainty on budget allocations
for the relevant industries over a period of seven years. Becoming a member or being affiliated
to a member of the Joint Undertaking allows involvement in the preparation and implementation
of the Joint Undertaking’s work programme, either directly or through the private members’
representatives, via the Governing Board of the Joint Undertaking, and through participation to
the private members’ associations own related Technical Committees (TCs), where input to the
definition of the Joint Undertaking research and innovation priorities is prepared. The Governing
Board is the decision-making body of the Joint Undertaking that decides on the long-term
strategic orientation of the partnership, as well as its annual priorities. Members should
therefore be able to contribute to the Joint Undertaking's agenda and priority setting through
the adoption and possible amendment of the SRIA (based on the Strategic Research and
Innovation Agenda of the industry), as well as the adoption of the annual work-plans. This may
include the specific conditions of the calls for proposals and the applicable funding per call
topic.
Without doubt, a reinforced community of industrial and research organisations brought
together around a common long-term strategic research agenda as proposed by the Clean
Hydrogen for Europe Joint Undertaking is of added value. A wider and strengthened community
will also work towards achieving the Horizon Europe and institutionalised partnership’s general
objectives237 to improve through research and innovation the cost-effectiveness, reliability,
quantity and quality of clean hydrogen solutions, including production, distribution, storage and
end uses developed in the Union. By continuously increasing its membership, the founding
members will strengthen their efforts to drive towards a more strategic and impact-based
approach to research and innovation, strengthening the knowledge and capacity of the
scientific and industrial actors along the Union’s hydrogen value chain. This will enable the
realisation of demonstrations of clean hydrogen solutions with the view to local, regional and
Union-wide deployment, addressing renewable production, distribution, storage, and use for
transport and energy-intensive industries as well as other applications. At the same time, the
235 See Annex III of the Horizon Europe Regulation on Partnerships selection/objectives
236 Article 2 of the SBA
237 Article 4 of the SBA
124EU’s industry, through the pooling of resources under each association, will increase its active
role in working together with the Union for delivering the objectives of the European Green Deal
and of the EU Hydrogen Strategy.
In this respect, all legal entities participating in the Clean Hydrogen JU programme should be
continuously encouraged (e.g. through Call Info-Days, Coordinators-Days etc) in becoming
members of the Clean Hydrogen JU through affiliation with the private founding members.
Members other than the Union / private founding members (the Associations), will do their
utmost to encourage membership of Hydrogen Europe Industry and Hydrogen Europe
Research. They will especially adopt measures for attracting newcomers, in particularly
SMEs, higher education institutions and research organisations.238 In addition, both
associations are strongly committed to deliver their financial contributions for the entire duration
or the JU programme (as has been the case for the FCH JU and FCH 2 JU) as well as promote
and enforce openness throughout the programme. However, since IKOP and IKAA financial
contributions may only be reported for Associations’ member companies or organisations, in
duly justified cases additional conditions requiring the participation of members of the joint
undertaking or their constituent or affiliated entities may be specified in the work programme.
Indeed, in line with the SBA239 in justified cases, it should be possible to introduce additional
conditions in a call topic that require the participation of a member of the Clean Hydrogen JU
or their constituent or affiliated entities, targeting activities where the industrial and research
partners of the Clean Hydrogen JU can play a key role, such as large-scale demonstrations,
flagship projects and strategic research projects. It is also possible240 to limit in exceptional
cases the participation in specific actions in the work programme in accordance with Article
22(5) of the Horizon Europe Regulation and in accordance with the position agreed on a case-
by-case basis between the Commission and the Member States in SRG. The limitations to
participation shall respect the provisions of Article 23 of the SBA,241 ensuring coherence with
the approach taken for actions funded under the Horizon Europe work programme adopted in
accordance with Article 13(2), point (b), of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon
Europe regarding the application of Article 22(5) of the Horizon Europe Regulation, as well as
Union legislation and guidance relevant for its application in similar topics in the work
programme of the JU. The level of participation of private members should be monitored by the
Executive Director in order to empower the Governing Board to take appropriate actions,
ensuring a balance between commitment from partners and openness.
Therefore, the annual work-plans of the Clean Hydrogen JU can include, at the level of call
topics for key Innovation Actions of strategic importance242, the additional condition243 that
requires the participation of a member of the Clean Hydrogen JU or their affiliate entities.
Such strategic topics may target activities where the industrial partners of the Clean Hydrogen
JU can play a key role in accelerating the commercialisation of hydrogen technologies by being
closely linked to the Clean Hydrogen JU constituency which could further ensure full alignment
with the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda of Hydrogen Europe and Hydrogen Europe
Research and the SRIA. This would also ensure the continuity of the work performed within
238 Article 17 (2) (m) of the SBA.
239 Recital 16 and Article 15(2)(a) of the SBA.
240 Article 17(2)(l) of the SBA.

125projects funded through the H2020 and FP7, by building up on their experience and
consolidating the EU value-chain.
It is crucial to secure that relevant project results are exploited fully in line with the
commercialisation needs of the EU hydrogen industry with maximised cross-fertilisation of
knowledge within the whole sector, which can be greatly facilitated by the presence of members
or their affiliates of the Clean Hydrogen JU in the projects’ consortia. Moreover, strengthened
exchange of information between the sector players (through presence of members) will help
avoid duplication of effort with other activities performed outside the Clean Hydrogen JU and
contribute to a maximum coherence of the overall European technology investment and a
maximum impact of the EU funding, in reaching the EU hydrogen Strategy final objectives.
As stated above for certain key innovation topics of strategic importance selected as described
above such as flagship projects, there could be additional eligibility conditions for the
consortium).
Types of action: specific provisions and funding rates
The call for proposals will distinguish between different levels of technology readiness and may
consider decreasing funding rates or capping the funding from the EU/JU to be complemented
by higher industry and/or research investment.
In consideration of the specific objective of the Clean Hydrogen JU to increase commitments
and contributions in a qualitative and quantitative manner (see above), it is expected that private
members should make a substantial share of their contributions at the level of indirect actions
(‘projects’) funded by the Clean Hydrogen JU.
A key element of the Clean Hydrogen JU is therefore to leverage EU funding with contributions
of private members. This will be achieved by a lower funding intensity of projects and a higher
co-investment/co-funding of project participants/beneficiaries. For example, the Clean
Hydrogen JU’s programme may limit the funding for a flagship project, corresponding to higher
industry (and research) investment or co-funding.
A flagship project is a project that is expected to have significant impact in accelerating the
transition to a hydrogen economy. A limited number of flagship projects could be selected to
become “Green Deal accelerator projects” to contribute to the European Green Deal objectives
and that has identified on EU, national or regional level concrete synergies with other
programmes and instruments such as partnerships (large impact is the main goal while the
magnitude of investment is variable).
A number of flagship projects, without limitation in numbers, can be identified with the specific
objective to demonstrate the viability of clean hydrogen solutions at scale, are actions (mostly
Innovation Actions, but may also be strategic Research Actions) that constitute a first-of-a-kind
demonstration at scale, in real operational environment of the different generations of hydrogen
applications (including sectoral integration such as Hydrogen Valleys). Geographical balance
should be ensured in the case of these flagship projects to ensure pan-European impact.
It is expected that after completion of such flagship project the hydrogen application(s) is/are
fully demonstrated (including its business model) and if successful, can further enter the market
deployment stage and be replicated at scale (or on a commercial basis). These projects will be
implemented through Innovation Actions (or Research and Innovation Actions exceptionally)
and may include some special characteristics i.e. a high total budget to achieve volume and
scale, therefore limited funding and demanding a large co-funding from
126participants/beneficiaries such as industry (and consequently related strong involvement of
most of the industrial players supporting the concerned hydrogen applications).
The exact limit of funding will be defined at the level of each annual work-plan for the relevant
call topics, and should be based on the specific strategic agenda of the Clean Hydrogen JU
and the related commitment of industry244, and approved annually by its Governing Board.
For these flagship projects, where a reduction of funding will be applied, and where it is
expected that important involvement from industrial stakeholders and/or end-users (such as
public authorities) and corresponding contributions shall be made, synergies with other sources
of funding and financing shall be sought245. In that respect, consortia will be encouraged to
identify and secure additional funding and financing sources. The flagship topics may
consequently require that proposals include a financing scheme describing the business model,
including envisaged sources of co-funding/co-financing in line with state-aid rules.
In line with the SBA246 in duly justified cases, the capital expenditure for, e.g. large scale
demonstrators or flagship projects, may be considered as an eligible cost in line with the
applicable legal framework and synergies with other partnerships apply.
Therefore, it is considered that in the flagship projects247 where the activities may receive limited
funding under the Clean Hydrogen JU, the full capital expenditure of equipment to be
demonstrated should be considered as eligible costs. To this end, option 2 of section C2 of
Article 6.2 “Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category” of the Horizon Europe Model
Grant Agreement248 would be enabled, at topic level, in the annual work-plan, in order to allow
for the purchase of equipment, infrastructure and other assets specifically for the action to be
declared as full capitalised costs.
Rules for participation
The Horizon Europe Regulation shall apply to the actions funded by the joint undertaking under
Horizon Europe249.
Each joint undertaking shall be considered as a funding body and shall provide financial support
to indirect actions pursuant to Article 6 of that Regulation. In addition, actions funded by the JU
under Horizon Europe may also be subject to any specific provisions set out in Part Two of the
SBA, as well as in section 5 of the present document.
In accordance with article 3 of the SBA, in order to take into account the duration of Horizon
Europe, calls for proposals under the joint undertakings shall be launched at the latest by 31
December 2027. In duly justified cases, calls for proposals may be launched by 31 December
2028, at the latest.

It shall be regularly informed of the activities of the JU and shall be invited to provide comments
on the JU’s planned initiatives. The meetings of the SG shall be convened by the ED.
The ED may advise the GB to consult the SG on specific questions. Where such consultation
takes place, a report shall be submitted to the GB after the relevant discussion in the SG.
1307. Programme monitoring and reporting
The European Commission monitors the EU research and innovation framework through a
systematic process of data collection, addressing in particular how the Horizon Europe
programme is implemented. The activities of the joint undertakings are subject to continuous
monitoring and periodic reviews in accordance with their financial rules, to ensure the highest
impact, scientific excellence and the most efficient use of resources. The outcomes of
monitoring and periodic reviews feed into the monitoring of European partnerships and
evaluations of the Joint Undertakings as part of Horizon Europe evaluations. This provides the
necessary evidence base to guide the effective and efficient implementation of partnerships
throughout their lifecycle and inform the strategic discussions on the partnership policies.
To achieve that, all European partnerships need to establish a monitoring system that can track
progress towards their objectives as set out in the SBA and the Horizon Europe Regulation, as
well as the priorities of the Union and the SRIA.258
As part of this effort, the Clean Hydrogen JU will continuously monitor its management activities
and perform periodic reviews of the outputs, results and impacts of its projects, implemented in
accordance with the Horizon Europe Regulation. The monitoring shall be performed (a) via
reporting on indicators towards the achievements of its objectives, and (b) by reporting
information on a number of social, technologic and administrative indicators, including on its
financial performance.259
A. Horizon Europe KIPs (Key Impact Pathways)
At the level of the Horizon Europe Programme, the monitoring will be simplified and
standardised as much as possible. These indicators will be determined by the European
Commission, which will also collect the necessary information on projects, their results and
expected impact through its IT systems. This will allow to trace the contributions of the Clean
Hydrogen JU to the Key Impact Pathways, set out in the Annexes of the Horizon Europe
Regulation, through their projects automatically and in a consistent manner with the rest of the
programme.
B. Partnership KPIs
At the level of partnerships, an Expert Group has been set up to support the Strategic
Coordination Process, the new governance framework for EU R&I partnerships. In its first
interim report,260 the Expert Group focused on developing a framework for reporting and
monitoring on the progress made by all forms of European partnerships – individually
(‘partnership-specific indicators’) and as a whole (‘common indicators’), while making sure it is
aligned with the Horizon Europe monitoring system and its Key Impact Pathways.261
In particular, the Expert Group has proposed a set of common indicators for all the partnerships,
including recommendations to make them operational, such as methodologies and
identification of required data to monitor these indicators. The aim of these indicators is to
258 Articles 5.2(h), 17.2(a), 19.4(f)/(g)/(o), 36, 74(a) and 171 of the SBA.
259 Article 171 of the SBA.
260 A robust and harmonised framework for reporting and monitoring European Partnerships in Horizon
Europe, 2021, RTD, https://europa.eu/!b3TBfW.
261 As stated in the executive summary of the interim report, the “proposed common indicators represent
the best understanding of the Expert Group at the time this report is written, the Expert Group will continue
its work until summer 2022… the Expert Group or the Commission may decide it is necessary to revise the
proposal for the common indicators at a later stage”.
131monitor quantitative and qualitative information and aspects, which should be able to capture
the full value the partnerships, an aspect not well developed in the past. The monitoring system
and indicators defined are expected to be closely related to the data reporting system of the
European Commission, although not all data will become available directly through its IT
systems. In those cases, the JU will need to setup the appropriate processes for the collection
and reporting of the data.
C. Clean Hydrogen JU Strategy Map and JU specific KPIs
The Expert Group also supported the partnerships in preparing their set of specific indicators
intended to monitor the progress towards the achievement of its partnership specific objectives.
To this end, the Expert Group prepared a set of guidelines with recommendations for the
partnerships on how to establish and design the monitoring framework, as well as define the
appropriate indicators. In particular, the Expert Group stated the view in its interim report that
despite the usefulness of the generic monitoring frameworks reflecting the objectives set in the
regulations, a more simplified and easier to communicate approach is required to simplify the
multiple layers of objectives and monitoring frameworks. Moreover, these objectives tend to be
policy objectives, often overlapping with each other and missing interlinks between the different
levels, than the clearly defined, distinct, well-structured and measurable objectives that are
needed for a monitoring framework.
In practice, each partnership needs to meet a number of high level objectives: from the two
sets of general objectives in the SBA (one for all partnerships and one for each specific
partnership), to the objectives of the Horizon Europe Regulation and the policy objectives and
priorities of the Union. The latter can be reflected to a large extent in the Key Strategic
Orientations for research and innovation of the Horizon Europe Programme262 and the relevant
impact areas, and on an even higher level to the "2030 Agenda" and the associated SDGs.
Each partnership can have an impact by contributing through its Programme to certain aspects
of these high level objectives. The monitoring framework should thus be able to capture these
efforts/actions, their outcomes and their subsequent impact.
The Clean Hydrogen JU, following these recommendations and in communication with the
European Commission and the Expert Group, prepared a comprehensive set of indicators
fitting the proposed framework. Following the proposed “Strategy Map logic” of the Expert
Group, the proposed indicators aim to link the resources of the partnership and the actions
taken (operational objectives / indicators) towards concrete outcomes (specific objectives /
indicators) and directly to one (or more) of the general objectives and intended impacts of the
Clean Hydrogen JU, which would contribute in turn to one or more high-level objectives of the
Union.
Figure 3 below presents the JU’s strategy map, linking actions with expected outcomes and
intended impacts. Annex I provides a detailed description of the KPIs that will be used to
monitor them, as well as the link of the different items of the strategy map with the various JU
objectives (the links are mentioned in the second column of the table in Annex I).

It needs to be emphasised that the strategy map does not aim to replace the legal objectives
of the JU, as reflected in the SBA and the Horizon Europe Regulation, but to restructure and
further specify them, in order to be able to better define the relevant indicators for the monitoring
framework, avoid overlaps and make more obvious the interlinkages between them.
More specifically, on the different levels of the strategy map:
(macro level objectives) Three high-level policy objectives, relating to major societal challenges,
were identified as most relevant to the JU: Climate Action, Clean Energy and Sustainable
Growth. These high-level objectives are linked with a number of SDGs, but one Key Strategic
Orientation of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan: making Europe the first digitally enabled
circular climate neutral and sustainable economy, through the transformation of its mobility,
energy, construction and production systems.
(general level impacts) The general level objectives of the JU should aim to have an impact
towards the achievement of the above macro level objectives. The Clean Hydrogen JU has two
sets of general objectives, as defined in the SBA:
a. On one hand, the general objectives applicable for all partnerships, which contribute in
the key impact pathway categories (Scientific, Societal and Economic/Technological).
These are made more specific in the context of Horizon’s Europe Cluster 5 and its
Strategic Plan, by linking them with impact areas (or “Destinations”) and the expected
impacts the JU could contribute in these areas. The relevant impact areas for the JU262
are (22), (23) and (24), related to the clean energy transition and climate neutrality, as
well as (15) concerning global leadership in clean and climate neutral value chains;
b. On the other hand, the general objectives of the JU are to contribute towards the Green
Deal and the Hydrogen Strategy, to strengthen the Union clean hydrogen value chain,
notable supporting SMEs, and to stimulate research and innovation in clean hydrogen
technologies.
Combining the two sets of objectives above and placing them in the context of the macro level
133objectives leads to the three areas where the JU would be able to contribute the most:
1. Action against climate change by drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions;
2. Transition to a clean energy system with renewable hydrogen as one of its main pillars;
3. Emergence of a competitive and innovative European hydrogen value chain.
Therefore the above form the general level impacts of the JU in its strategy map.
(specific level outcomes) The specific level objectives of the JU identify what should be the
main direct outcomes and results from the activities of the JU. These should be contributing to
the general level impacts of the JU. As in the case of the general objectives, the Clean
Hydrogen JU has two sets of specific objectives, as defined in the SBA. They both focus on the
acceleration of the transition towards the goals set by the Green Deal, the enhancement of the
research and innovation ecosystem, including SMEs and involving stakeholders in all MS, as
well as the delivery of innovative technology solutions and their uptake by the market, with the
view to local, regional and Union-wide deployment.
On the basis of these objectives, seen in the specific context of the Clean Hydrogen JU, these
were translated in the following specific level outcomes in the context of the strategy map:
1. Limiting the environmental impact of hydrogen technology applications;
2. Improving the cost-effectiveness of clean hydrogen solutions;
3. Demonstrating clean hydrogen solutions, in synergy with other Partnerships;
4. Increasing public awareness and uptake of hydrogen technologies;
5. Reinforcing EU scientific and industrial ecosystem, including SMEs.
The particular value of the above five points is that they turn the more general language of the
specific objectives of the JU into more concrete, separated and measurable outcomes, that can
be used for its monitoring framework. Moreover, they provide a clear link between the JU
impacts and actions, offering the necessary consistency needed for the JU’s strategy map as
a whole.
(operational objectives and additional tasks) The bottom level of the strategy map describes
the necessary actions and activities of the JU that will lead to the aforementioned outcomes.
These should be in line with the operational objectives and tasks of the JU, as specified in the
SBA, and fall in line with the activities described in the present SRIA:
1. Supporting climate neutral and sustainable solutions;
2. Research and Innovation for hydrogen technologies;
3. Supporting market uptake of clean hydrogen applications.
D. SRIA Technology KPIs
Further to the above monitoring activities, one of the tasks of the Clean Hydrogen JU defined
in the SBA is to identify and report the knowledge acquired from the management of research
and innovation projects and their results, to serve as input for monitoring, evaluating, and
rectifying (if necessary) existing policy measures or shaping new policy initiatives and
decisions. The progress of the research and innovation projects will be measured by comparing
the results of the projects against the relevant technology KPIs proposed in the Annexes 2 to
6 of this SRIA. This shall help measure how the outcomes of Clean Hydrogen JU’s R&D actions
contribute towards the achievements of the technological objectives of each pillar. Moreover,
134the technology monitoring activity of the Clean Hydrogen JU will support EU policy making by
providing timely information on the state-of-the-art and the achievements of the Clean
Hydrogen JU. Technology monitoring shall be performed via the knowledge management
activities described in Section 4.6, supported also by JRC.
The methodology for the selection and definition of the technology KPIs, as well as the
identification of the SoA and future targets, was performed by JRC. The KPIs were defined so
that they could address specific aspects for improvement of technologies or applications and
are aligned with a given objective of the SRIA. They should be measurable, while future target
values should be realistic, i.e. achievable related to the Programme objectives within the set
timeframe, considering also the available resources.
The process of setting the KPIs was coordinated by the Programme Office and mobilised
several working groups composed of experts from industry and research organisations
designated by Hydrogen Europe and Hydrogen Europe Research. Each working group
corresponding to a specific pillar of the SRIA followed the same methodology to evaluate the
SoA in 2020 and set the KPIs targets for the years 2024 and 2030.
The methodology was based on draft forms including a clear definition of the KPIs, the
boundary conditions and the sources of the data to ensure full transparency and traceability.
The SoA was well-documented, with all associated references, and a justification was provided
on how the future targets were agreed during the exercise. The sources included market
surveys, literature reviews, expert opinions, data provided by OEMs either through field
measurements or model calculation, learning curves, etc. Moreover, FCH technologies are
often co-existing or competing with incumbent technologies. Hence, when defining KPIs,
establishing SoA values and setting targets, the related performance of other technologies
against these KPIs was also considered in order to be relevant and appropriate.
E. Financial Performance monitoring and reporting
The ED will report annually on the actions carried out and the corresponding expenditure, the
proposals submitted, including breakdown per participant type, SMEs and country distribution,
the actions selected for funding, the additional activities undertaken by its members other than
the Union and the collaboration and synergies with other partnerships as well as national and
regional initiatives263.
Furthermore, the Clean Hydrogen JU PO will prepare annually the accounts and the report on
budgetary and financial management264.
The ED will also monitor and report regularly to the GB on the level of in-kind contributions to
operational activities and the progress in achieving the targets and will propose measures to
remedy if necessary265.
The private Members of the Clean Hydrogen JU shall report each year by 31st of May to the
GB on the estimated value of the in-kind contributions to additional activities incurred during
the previous financial year.266
In addition, the Clean Hydrogen JU will carry out periodic reviews of its activities in line with
Art.171.7 of the SBA.

1358. Modern Administration
Objective of human resource management
Clean Hydrogen JU ensures an effective management of human resources aiming to optimise
the capacity to deliver on the Clean Hydrogen JU’s objectives and core business.
The Clean Hydrogen JU relies on a performance culture in which staff is motivated and can
deliver work of a consistently high quality, adding value.
Main principles of the human resources management of the Clean
Hydrogen JU
The Clean Hydrogen JU will ensure its organisational structure and staff allocation is adapted
to its needs and priorities, allocating staff efficiently taking into account the talent and potential
of staff and workload issues. It will pay special attention to staff development and to
implementing new effective ways of working.
The Clean Hydrogen JU will foster modern working methods. The feeling of belonging to the
Clean Hydrogen JU and of solidarity among colleagues is also crucial. It will build on the
momentum and revive the principles of the FCH culture. It will also prioritise digitalisation in HR
processes through further modules of the EC tool SYSPER when available to the Clean
Hydrogen JU, adoption of MIPS (EC mission tool), implementation of SYSTAL (recruitment tool
contracted and developed jointly with other JUs).
Diversity aiming at ensuring geographical balance where possible and gender balance will be
important considerations in selection procedures, without compromising competency-related
criteria.
Attention will also be paid to leadership development actions aimed at fostering a strong and
inspiring management adapted to the new working environment. Engagement and wellbeing
efforts will continue by implementing various actions (workshops, events, coaching, etc) and
will be measured by periodic staff surveys.
Internal communication play an important role in staff management and staff engagement.
Actions will include modernising and enhancing the intranet and the ways of communicating
both through established channels (meetings, information sessions, etc) and through new tools
(for example O365 package).
Staff establishment plan and human resources policy of the Clean
Hydrogen JU
The staff establishment plan of the Clean Hydrogen JU comprises temporary agents, contract
agents and seconded national experts. Other staff resources may include interim staff, trainees
and structural service providers.
The human resources policy of the Clean Hydrogen JU will be implemented in accordance with
SBA, the Staff regulations and conditions of employment of other agents of the EU and the
related implementing rules adopted by the GB of the Clean Hydrogen JU.
Sound financial management
Objective: Resources to be used in accordance with the principles of sound financial
136management267. Cost-effective controls to be in place, which give the necessary guarantees
concerning the legality and regularity of underlying transactions.
Assurance and audit
Objective: Ex-post controls, internal and external audits and reviews will continue to provide
the Executive Director and the Governing Board with the elements underpinning the reasonable
assurance that the resources assigned to the activities of the Clean Hydrogen JU have been
used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound financial
management, and that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees
concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
In this context, the objective is that the Clean Hydrogen JU will apply an agreed-upon control
framework, common to all Horizon Europe implementing services, laid down in:
i. ‘Comprehensive control strategy for Horizon Europe’;
ii. ‘Common ex-ante control for Horizon Europe’;
iii. ‘Horizon Europe Ex-post audit strategy’; and
iv. ‘Horizon Europe Antifraud strategy’
The Clean Hydrogen JU, in addition to implementation of the common framework, will apply
the following strategies in different types of audits:
Ex-post audits
The aim for Horizon Europe is to exercise the risk-based approach and efficient use of
resources in all stages of the Horizon Europe audit campaign. This includes prevention of
double-auditing and building on the lessons learnt from the most common mistakes of the
H2020 programme.
Internal Audits
The Clean Hydrogen JU will continue to support the Internal Audit Service (IAS) in conducting
their audit and consulting engagements, with the aim to add value and to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of the internal controls in order to achieve strategic and operational
objectives of the Horizon Europe programme.
Specific aim will be put on addressing the recommendations of the IAS stemming from their
reports in a timely manner.
ECA, EPPO, OLAF audits
The Clean Hydrogen JU will provide support and assistance to the Court of Auditors, the
European Anti-fraud Office and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office in their on-the-spot
checks, desk reviews, audits and investigations and will ensure timely follow up and
implementation of the action plans stemming from these engagements.
Financial management
To demonstrate its commitment to the best use of financial resources, the Clean Hydrogen JU
will aim for an error rate, over the course of the multiannual expenditure period, within a range
of 2-5 % on an annual basis, with the ultimate aim to achieve a residual error rate as close as
267 Art.71 of the Regulation (EU,Euratom) 2018/1046
137possible to 2 % at the closure of the SRIA268. To meet this target, the JU will ensure sound
financial management through the management of transactions. The JU will strive to attain
effectiveness through update of its monitoring tools, workflows, procedures, guidelines,
templates, check-lists, training sessions and additional guidance for actors in the financial
circuits.
Another aspect of sound financial management is the relationship between the costs of controls
and its benefits. The JU’s control system will reflect the right balance between attaining an
acceptable error rate and the control burden required, to avoid compromising on the
attractiveness of the JU programme269.
Furthermore, efficiency and cost effectiveness of financial activities will further improve thanks
to the adoption of various corporate tools: eProcurement, SUMMA (accounting system).
The Clean Hydrogen JU will accurately assess the needs for financing the activities described
above by assuring a close follow-up of the execution of budget, correcting the budget with
transfers with the aim to reach 100% budget execution and subsequently provides detailed
periodic reporting on the budget implementation to the management.
Internal control and risk management
Objective: The Clean Hydrogen JU will continue to reinforce processes designed to provide
reasonable assurance of achieving the following objectives:
1) Effectiveness and efficiency of operations
2) Reliability of reporting
3) Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
The Clean Hydrogen JU has set up and will further strengthen processes to ensure the
adequate management of the risks relating to the legality and regularity of the underlying
transactions, taking into account the multiannual character of its programme as well as the
nature of the payments concerned.
Ethical and organisation values are embedded in the JU’s internal control framework. Control
system includes procedures for selecting the best projects through independent evaluation,
ensures a robust project and contract management throughout the lifetime of every project,
performs ex-ante checks on 100% of claims and includes ex-post audits on a sample of
claims270. Specific attention will be placed in mitigating the inherent risk of conflict of interest271.
Fraud risk management
Objective: The Clean Hydrogen JU is committed to the protection of the financial interests of
the Union and the fight against fraud affecting these interests.
The JU applies ‘mutatis mutandis’ the common Research Family Anti-Fraud Strategy (RAFS)
and the DG R&I AFS and participates to the Fraud And IRregularities (FAIR) meetings
organized by DG R&I. The JU uses the EC IT tools for grant management, financial systems
and procurement activity that encompass tools to prevent or detect fraud (such as for example
268 Art. 2.2.3 of the Clean Hydrogen Legislative Financial Statement
269 Art. 2.2.1 of the Clean Hydrogen Legislative Financial Statement
270 Art. 2.2.1 of the Clean Hydrogen Legislative Financial Statement
271 Art. 2.2.2 of the Clean Hydrogen Legislative Financial Statement
138plagiarism, double funding, undisclosed conflict of interest). It is also vigilant in the management
of external service providers and prioritises resilience against cyber-attacks.
It will continue to take actions including
• Emphasising the anti-fraud strategy and raising fraud awareness (through anti-fraud
training and surveys)
• Making proficient use of tools for identifying double funding.
• Applying the preventive measures including the use of IT tools for detecting suspicious
circumstances and know-how on how to identify irregularities.
• Including identifying and assessing fraud risk during the risk-assessment exercises
Document Management, digital transformation and information
management
The Joint Undertaking is aligned with the vision of President von der Leyen for each EC
organisation to lead by example in digital transformation. The Commission's Digital Strategy272,
adopted in November 2018 and the implementation Plan, approved by the Information
Technology Cybersecurity Board (ITCB) in March 2020, is key to a transition to a new digital
era and is clustered on the following pillars:
• paperless, streamlined procedures that use technology to remove mechanical tasks.
• improved access to and use of data to work more efficiently and be more transparent.
• staff collaborating efficiently and easily anytime, anywhere and with all stakeholders.
The Clean Hydrogen approach will be fully in line with the above pillars and will support the
following objectives:
Information Management
Objective: The Clean Hydrogen JU will use a portfolio of secure, state-of-the-art corporate
digital solutions
This portfolio is composed of many digital systems for administrative supports. The Directorates
General own these systems and they are crucial for the efficiency and effectiveness of the JU
as it automates its processes. It is essential that the Clean Hydrogen JU continues to use or
adopt flagship digital solutions developed by DIGIT, such as for example: in the domain of
human resources (SYSPER), document management (ARES), procurement (eProcurement),
grants (eGrants), web presence (Next-EUROPA), citizens’ engagement (EUSurvey),
collaboration (AresBridge) and information systems which are:
• either connected to a managed service such EU LOGIN, EU SIGN, EU SEND or EU
ACCESS or
• deploying a building block (via an EU Programme) such as eID, eSignature, eDelivery
In that context, the Joint Undertaking will continue to grow on the current IT Landscape,
adopting the reusable solutions platform (RSP) as much as possible offered by the Commission
and DIGIT to the Joint Undertakings were the costs efficiency on long term are obvious.
Objective: The Clean Hydrogen JU will exploit the potential of data, information, knowledge and
content management for running the program, communication to citizens and stakeholders and
272 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/digitally-transformed_user-focused_data-
driven_commission_en.pdf
139best staff engagement
Digital solutions already available to the Joint Undertaking facilitate the interaction with internal
actors (collaboration, intranet, My IntraComm) and external stakeholders and citizens (web
presence platform (Europa), collaboration, engagement (EU Survey), e-learning).
But we will keep also our autonomy to adopt specific digital solutions necessary to perform our
tasks related to the administrative implementation of the program helping to the collecting of
data’s and reporting on the KPIs, or adopting new platform for sharing and reuse of
information’s that are not available directly to the Joint Undertakings from existing catalog of
services.
Digital Transformation
Objective: The Clean Hydrogen JU will build a performing digital infrastructure and a fit-for-
purpose Digital Workplace
Each staff member will benefit from a modern, individualised digital workplace remotely
accessible, allowing for more flexibility and work-life balance. The digital ecosystem is
supported by standardised and centrally managed IT equipment and support services as well
as by cloud services. The adoption of emerging technologies will allow us to easily access data
repositories in the cloud, mobile device integration, and the ability to participate in calls,
videoconferences, and other collaborative workgroup from anywhere at any time.
Concerning the digital infrastructure, we will continue to consolidate the secure, hybrid
infrastructure cloud services of the previous Joint Undertakings hosted in the White Atrium,
which combines services running in the community cloud and in the public cloud, and rely on
the secure pan-European networks for the Commission, executive agencies and other
European institutions. We will further exploit and offer the reusable element to the other Joint
Undertakings or interested agencies
Objective: The Clean Hydrogen JU will reinforce its resilience to ever evolving digital security
threats
Cybersecurity is essential for modern, secure, and trustworthy IT both for the Joint Undertaking
and in its interaction with outside stakeholders. The strategy sets four long-term objectives:
• IT security processes: To ensure that key IT security processes are in place, in line
following good practices and recommendations.
• Monitoring and response: To ensure state-of-the-art monitoring and response
capabilities, to detect attacks timely and resolve IT security incidents quickly.
• Infrastructure security: To provide a secured infrastructure by design.
• Governance and awareness: To ensure that senior management, IT experts and normal
end-users are well informed about threats and risks.
Objective: The Clean Hydrogen JU will deliver modern, trustworthy, efficient, and transparent
IT Governance
We will continue to invest in agile, transversal, and empowered IT Governance collaboration,
with a bottom-up review platform for approval and delegate the project implementation to key
IT services providers. Service level agreements already in place for the common digital
infrastructure will be renewed and possibly extended to improve synergies and efficiencies
among JUs. The execution of the Governance and the Business Continuity activities will be
also supported by studies services such as advice, benchmarking, and high-level consultancy.
We will also continue to participate in the representative user groups for corporate solutions, in
the network of agencies for ICT Advisory and join any added-value interinstitutional framework
140contracts or inter-agency joint procurement.
Raising awareness and paying attention to change management related to the digital skills is
essential. Our mind-set will evolve:
• Digitally skilled managers should lead by example.
• We will align management and culture with more collaborative, more transparent ways
of working.
• The Clean Hydrogen JU will count and build upon digital skills of existing or new staff.
• And establish recommended IT training for all staff, leaving no-one behind.
Document Management
The Clean Hydrogen JU is keeping a close eye on the EC Digital Strategy273 (ECDS) adopted
to steer the digital transformation of the Commission. The Clean Hydrogen JU`s document
management is a cornerstone and fully aligned with this transition towards a fully digitisation
era.
Objective: The European Commission electronic archiving and document management policy
will apply by analogy in the Clean Hydrogen JU for automated registration, filing and
preservation of records in a corporate tool
The Clean Hydrogen JU applies “mutatis mutandis” the EC`s decision274 and its implementing
rules275 on records management and archives (known as “e-Domec” policy). Its main
implementation IT tool Hermes-ARES-NomCom will continue to interact with all the main
operational and daily administrative activities and processes directly or indirectly via
integrations in other IT tools
To achieve this objective the JU is planning to:
• embed modern record management in the processes
• ensure access to information and data by making registered records easily retrievable
and as widely available as possible by their secure and systematic filing and
preservation in Hermes/Ares/NomCom
• treat the pre-“e-domec” paper archives according to the Common Retention List of files,
make inventories and apply actions of digitalisation, elimination or transfer to the
Commission Historical Archives
• include staff upskilling and reskilling as part of the strategy to increase progressively the
collective behavioural and culture change on document management
• raise staff awareness on efficiency gains such as that record management can create
synergies
The Clean Hydrogen JU has already a significant digital solutions portfolio, which enables fast,
effective and transparent policy implementation and monitoring of its activities within a modern
paperless administration and “e-only” document and approval process environment, thanks to
the “eSignature” CEF module already used.
Objective: The Clean Hydrogen JU aim to take further advantages of any secure, interoperable
digital solutions
To achieve this objective:
273 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/digitally-transformed_user-focused_data-
driven_commission_en.pdf
274 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/c_2020_4482_en.pdf
275 https://myintracomm.ec.europa.eu/sg/edomec/Documents/SEC_2020_800_en.pdf
141• The document management and archiving policy of the Clean Hydrogen JU will then
use more reusable corporate CEF building blocks and services (eArchiving, eDelivery,
eTranslation, eInvoicing) or full electronic case handling (eGrants, eSubmissions,
eSignatures and electronic certificates)
• The Clean Hydrogen JU will foster a culture of correct processing of shared information
• The JU will encourage the use of collaborative electronic tools with a more 'open,
inclusive, cooperative, co-create, co-innovative and co-deliver way of working'
• The tools adopted will consider the right of access to documents, data protection,
sharing information, data management and knowledge management aspects with a
view to creating opportunities for efficiency gains, modernisation and improvements
Sound environmental management
Objective: The Clean Hydrogen JU will strive to improve its environmental impact in all its
actions and will actively promote measures to reduce the related day-to-day impact of the
administration and its work.
The Covid-19 crisis triggered the need to explore alternative working solutions, as the concept
of a ‘new normal’ working landscape emerged. The Clean Hydrogen JU will redesign certain
working, business, and organisational processes. We plan to transform the program office into
a safe, modern and welcoming place to work, with good quality, sustainable and green
solutions. Among others, we will contribute to the delivery and implementation of:
• paperless procedures and enablers (such as electronic signatures or eProcurement,
supported by mobile apps enabling staff to work in a smarter, seamless way) that will
be further improved and integrated at corporate level.
• remote work as integrated way of working.
• the use of modern technologies (such as “more wireless, less cables”, Wi-Fi
everywhere, connected meeting rooms) can make the working place safer and easier.
• improving the ways to identify yourself with a single sign on (EU Login) enhance the
security but also facilitate the access to any information.
• the use of web/videoconferencing-based meetings as valid sustainable alternative to
staff missions and physical meetings, which represents a significant benefit in terms of
environmental footprint, efficiency, and work-life balance.
• more dynamic approaches to the use of office space;
• investigate with the building owner the integration of new technology to make our actual
building smart and eco-friendly.
• reducing and managing waste (sorting stations, glass containers, awareness raising
campaigns).
• promoting green public procurement by introducing specific office supplies’ catalogues,
including only 100% green items.

Notes:
KPI-1: Time that a maintained compressor system, with its minor components/parts (no core) being replaced, is able to operate
until End-of-Life (EoL) criterium is met. For mature technology (TRL≥6), the main EoL criterium is the optimisation of total cost of
system (evaluated as TCO, total cost of ownership as CAPEX + n∙OPEX(n), with OPEX dependent by time [year(n)] due to
performance degradation). In mathematical terms, assuming a linear time degradation, lifetime is expressed in years as the square
root of the ratio between CAPEX and yearly degradation (expressed as the yearly increment of maintenance and consumption
cost due to the degradation of performance with respect to Beginning-Of-Life – BoL -, i.e., additional substitution spare parts). For
emerging technology (TRL ≤5), EoL criterium assumes compression system (core parts) achieved the 90% of BoL performance
(as compressed flow rate or pressure ratio).
KPI-2: Energy consumption to compress a kilogram of H2 from 5 bar(a) to 100 bar (without considering cooling power). Inlet
pressure 5 bar(a), outlet pressure 100 bar(a) sufficient for most pipeline streams. This KPI is specifically for Pipeline application,
and large-scale compression system (>1000 kg/d). Energy consumption needs only for the compression process, not include the
cooling power. For mature tech (TRL≥6), KPI is focused on the system level, while for innovative tech (TRL ≤5), it regards the core
part of technology.
KPI-3: Energy consumption to compress a kilogram of H from 30 bar(a) to 900 bar(a). This KPI is specifically for HRS application,
2
and mid-scale compression system (200-1000 kg/d). Energy consumption needs only for the compression process, does not
include the cooling power. For mature tech (TRL≥6), KPI is focused on the system level, while for innovative tech (TRL ≤5), KPI
regards the core part of technology.
KPI-4: Mean time between failure (or stoppage) of the system that render the system inoperable without maintenance. PI connected
to the technology. Reliability should be estimated by sufficient failure events in proper long-term tests. For mature tech (TRL≥6),
failure can be associated to rupture, wear, degradation of compressors parts which occurs without correct maintenance while for
innovative tech (TRL ≤5), failure focus exclusively on the key element of technology (e.g., membrane, electrochemical cell, or
active material)
KPI-5: Ratio of the maintenance costs, both fixed and variable (including overhaul cost, repair cost, replacement cost, maintenance
cost) per unit of compressed hydrogen output. Energy cost is not considered. Values is estimated as the ratio of total O&M cost
(typical as annual percentage of CAPEX) and the yearly amount of compressed hydrogen, considering compressor
availability/operating time about 100% (8760 hrs.). Same boundaries conditions as for KP-2 and KPI-3 for pipeline and HRS.
KPI-6: Capital cost of manufacturing of the compressor device (capital cost of system) normalised to the daily nominal capacity of
the system. Fluid is pure hydrogen compliance with ISO 14687:2019. Same boundaries conditions as for KP-2 and KPI-3 for
pipeline and HRS.
KPI-7: Concerning purification system.
KPI-8: Energy consumption to separate hydrogen from mixture. This KPI regards separation process, where it is necessary to
extract hydrogen from a mixture with low hydrogen content. (e.g. H from gas grid). Energy consumption must take in consideration
2
pressure and temperature requirements of the process. Additional efforts (compression, thermoregulation) should be taken in
account to normalise the energy cost with respect to reference case (feed stream pressure 30 bar, temperature 300K). For mature
tech (TRL≥6), KPI is focused on the system level, while for innovative tech (TRL ≤5), it regards the core part of technology. The
feed/inlet H molar fraction must be between 0.1 to 0.75. KPI should be evaluated with a minimum recovery rate of hydrogen about
2
80%. Output H molar fraction must be > 99%
2
KPI-9: Energy consumption to purify hydrogen. This KPI regards purification process, where it is necessary to extract hydrogen
from a mixture with high hydrogen content. (e.g. syngas). KPI for high TRL technology should be considered on the overall system,
while it should be focused on the key components for low TRL technology. Energy consumption must take into consideration the
technology's requirements for pressure or temperature. Additional efforts (compression, thermoregulation) should be taken in
account to normalise the cost with respect to reference case (feed stream pressure 30 bar, temperature 300K).
KPI-10: Ratio between output purified hydrogen flow and hydrogen content into the input feed flow. For high technology TRL this
regards overall purification/separation system. For low technology TRL, KPI focuses on the key elements of technology as
membrane/electrochemical cell/active material. Output feed must be in compliance with ISO 14687:2019. Molar fraction in feed
gas H for separation application should be in range between 0.1-0.75 molar fraction in feed gas H for purification application
2 2
should be in range between 0.75-0.9995.
KPI-11: Levelised cost of separation or purification process, expressed as the cost for the processed mass of H in kg. KPI focus
2
exclusively for high TRL technology. Minimum hydrogen recovery factor is 80%. Output H molar fraction must be > 99% or in
2
compliance with ISO 14687:2019 for purification application, where it needs.

Notes:
KPI-1: Hydrogen percentage content in gas turbine fuel, by mass (volume).
Boundary Conditions: applicable only to DLE technology. WLE technologies are not in scope. While state-of-the-art gas turbines
can already handle 20% hydrogen by vol (blended in natural gas), development of gas turbines (and more specifically combustors)
able to handle 0-100% H is a challenging and necessary task. Gas turbines operating in the range 0-100% H are required by
2 2
users in the power generation market to ensure security of power supply in case of H shortages or lack of availability. Development
2
of such combustors can be reached by gradually increasing the amount of H in gas turbines in the years to come to reduce
2
technical risks.
KPI-2: NO (NO + NO2) content in exhausts.
x
Boundary conditions: A fuel switch to hydrogen aims to retain all present strengths and ensure carbon-free energy conversion.
Although the technological development of GT combustors aims to minimise NO emissions, an increase in NO formation is
x x
expected as the hydrogen content in the fuel is increased. This is a consequence of the higher reactivity of hydrogen and the
related impact on flame stability, flame temperature etc. Conserving the same low-NO emissions level of 25 ppmv@15%O2/dry
x
when advancing from 30% (by volume) to 100% H remains a challenge. The conventional NO normalisation method (15%O2/dry)
2 x
is not designed to be translated across different fuels with different reactivity and exhaust gases. A more appropriate normalisation
for NO emissions is expressed in mg/MJ of fired-power, and therefore the KPI table also provides this alternative normalisation.
x
KPI-3: Hydrogen content during gas turbine start-up.
Boundary conditions: during start-up gas turbines are commonly fuelled with natural gas or liquid oil.

117711Annex 7 – Common R&I Roadmaps
The Clean Hydrogen JU co-operated closely with other partnerships in an effort to align their
work Programmes and identify synergies. When possible, they developed common Roadmaps,
aiming to better coordinate the planned activities per partnership in the context of R&I in
hydrogen technologies. This common planning should prevent overlaps, enable synergies and
lead to a more effective allocation of funds towards hydrogen technologies in the context of the
Horizon Europe Programme.
This Annex presents the commonly developed Roadmaps with the following partnerships:
• Processes4Planet (P4P)
• Clean Steel
• 2ZERO
• ZEWT
• Clean Aviation
• EURAMET
• EIC
• EERA
Additionally, and in the same context, the Clean Hydrogen JU had exchanges with Europe’s
Rail partnership, ERA on Green Hydrogen and BEPA identifying possible synergies in their
Programmes. The discussions with Europe’s Rail partnership are at an advanced level, but a
Common Roadmap has not been established yet (until the adoption of the SRIA). The
discussions with BEPA have not identified significant areas of collaboration at first stage, but
the two partnerships will inform each other on any developments relevant to both. The
exchanges with ERA on Green Hydrogen have identified a large potential for collaboration of
the JU with ERA / Member States in many topics, so exchanges will continue to update each
other on the topics/results from both programs, and potentially align topics (and complement
funding) in future calls for proposals.
Further exploratory meetings will be pursued both with the above partnerships, but also with
other partnerships and programmes, such as B4P, to ensure that the actions that are funded
by each programme are complementary.
Processes4Planet partnership
A strong collaboration is envisaged across the whole hydrogen value chain between the Clean
Hydrogen JU and P4P partnership. The Clean Hydrogen JU focuses on the development of
fuel cell and hydrogen related technologies (e.g. electrolysers, fuel cells, H2 storage) whilst
P4P focuses on the adaptation of industry processes to accommodate the integration and
demonstration of such technologies. Key to this collaboration are the synergies between the
Clean Hydrogen JU “H2 Valleys” and the P4P “Hubs for circularity”. As some of the R&I areas
are common to both a clear allocation of responsibilities in the work programmes to come will
be essential to avoid overlaps and maximise the impacts the Clean Hydrogen JU and P4P can
bring. An overview of the division of areas between P4P and Clean Hydrogen JU is provided in
the table below.

Synergies between the Clean Hydrogen JU “H2 Valleys” and “P4P” Hubs for

Clean Steel partnership
The steel and hydrogen industries have both a lot to gain in terms of upscaling electrolysers to
the GW scale, supplying enough green hydrogen to achieve low-CO2 direct iron ore reduction
117733through hydrogen. This is evident in the synergistic Work Plans of the two partnerships. Clean
Hydrogen will focus on the development of electrolysers, including high temperature
electrolysers that can use waste heat from the iron processes and Clean Steel will focus on
converting the smelting process to iron ore reduction using hydrogen. Hydrogen and Oxygen
produced from electrolysis can also be used in high temperature combustion processes with
suitable combustors. Safety and education related aspects of this transition are of importance
to both partnerships.
An overview of the task division between the Clean Hydrogen JU and the Clean Steel
partnership is provided in the table below.

Synergies with 2ZERO partnership
A strong collaboration is envisaged between Clean Hydrogen JU and 2ZERO as both
partnerships will deal with the development and deployment of hydrogen and fuel cells trucks.
The Clean Hydrogen JU will focus on the development of fuel cells system components starting
from low TRL research activities to the development of commercial products. Components
include stacks, module, BoP, tanks and the overall FC system.
The 2ZERO partnership will focus on the integration of the fuel cell system in heavy-duty
vehicles and the demonstration activities of these prototypes. Large demonstration activities
fall within the remit of the Clean Hydrogen JU, as well as the development and deployment of
hydrogen refuelling stations.
An overview of the task division between 2ZERO and Clean Hydrogen JU is provided in the

A strong collaboration is also envisaged between the Clean Hydrogen JU and ZEWT.
The development of the different technologies (e.g. fuel cells and tanks for hydrogen and zero
carbon hydrogen-derivative fuels) will be performed by the Clean Hydrogen JU following the
specifications set in coordination with ZEWT.
ZEWT will address technology integration, implementation and validation, for both maritime and
inland large scale shipping, while the Clean Hydrogen JU would focus on smaller scale maritime
and inland shipping.
The Clean Hydrogen JU will also address technology transfer from land application of H2
technologies (FC, tanks or refuelling infrastructure) as a prospect of rapid deployment, initiating
demonstration projects to validate technologies.
Regarding bunkering of alternative fuels at ports, i.e. standards, technical and operational
solutions, the Clean Hydrogen JU will focus on carbon-free fuels, and ZEWT would address
carbon neutral fuels.
An overview of the task division between the Clean Hydrogen JU and ZEWT is provided in the

Synergies with Clean Aviation partnership
A strong collaboration is envisaged between Clean Hydrogen JU and Clean Aviation
partnership.
The development of the different technologies (e.g. fuel cells and liquid hydrogen tanks) will be
done in Clean Hydrogen JU following the specifications set in conjunction with Clean Aviation
partnership.
The integration of these technologies into ground and later on flying demonstrators will be in
the scope of Clean Aviation partnership.
All technologies related to the airport hydrogen infrastructure will be developed and tested
under Clean Hydrogen JU, although the interface with the airplanes for refuelling will need
strong coordination.

Synergies with EURAMET
On the topic of hydrogen metering two main actions have been foreseen within the Clean
Hydrogen JU’s multi-annual work plan:
• Development of a greater accuracy within hydrogen sensors and flow meters;
• Integration of innovative metering, piping and instrumentation technologies into the
overall hydrogen innovation actions.
It is therefore considered opportune to explore potential synergies and joint actions with
EURAMET aiming to accelerate the global lead of Europe in metrology research. Exploratory
meetings will be pursued to ensure that the actions that are funded by each programme are
complementary and to determine if there are any possibilities for jointly funded actions.
Synergies with the European Innovation Council and the European Energy Research Alliance
A strong collaboration is envisaged with the EIC and the European Energy Research Alliance
(EERA) mainly on low-TRL research activities.
The implementation of the Clean Hydrogen JU Programme could benefit from the basic
research performed through the EIC programme in the field of hydrogen technologies.
Breakthrough research on other routes of renewable hydrogen production, hydrogen storage,
building blocks of hydrogen use in transport applications and reducing the loading of critical
raw materials in electrolysers and fuel cell is expected to be done by EIC, complementary to
the Clean Hydrogen JU projects. Successful research outcomes will be taken over and further
advanced by the Clean Hydrogen JU calls.
Additional synergies are also emphasised with the EERA’s Joint Programme on Fuel Cells &
Hydrogen related to research areas on electrochemical aspects of water electrolyser and fuel
cell and non-electrochemical hydrogen production, handling and storage through the 7 sub-
programmes of the Implementation Plan 2018-2030 such as:
• Electrolyte materials for low and high temperature fuel cells and electrolysers;
• Next generation of highly active, low cost and durable catalysts/electrodes;
• Cost effective manufacturing of manufacturing of stack materials and novel design
development;
• Development of innovative fuel cell system concepts;
• Better understanding of the physico-chemical processes through modelling, validation
and diagnosis;
• Cost effective and efficient hydrogen production and handling, including the
development and implementation of new codes and standards
117777• Different technologies for hydrogen storage.

Whereas:
(1) Simplification as a central aim of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme and
the Euratom Programme needs to be reflected in its design, rules, financial
management and implementation,
(2) Simpler funding rules reduce the administrative costs for participation and contribute
to the prevention and reduction of financial errors. In this respect, the use of lump
sum contributions is necessary to simplify the calculation of grant amounts, leading
to a significant decrease in the workload of both beneficiaries and the granting
authority as well as to accelerated payment procedures.
(3) Lump sum funding strongly increases the focus on the scientific/technical
performance and output of projects. This is desirable in the Horizon Europe
Framework Programme and Euratom Programme in order to improve the monitoring
quality of results and their further dissemination and exploitation.

3Annex
1. Forms of Union contribution and categories of costs covered
The Union contribution for actions under the Horizon Europe Framework programme and for
actions under the Euratom Programme complementing Horizon Europe may take the form of
a lump sum contribution, for calls or topics specified in the relevant Horizon Europe Work
Programme over the period 2021-2027 or in the relevant Euratom Work Programme over the
period 2021-2025.
The lump sum contribution will be determined for each grant by the granting authority on the
basis of the following principles:
(a) The lump sum contribution must be an approximation of the beneficiaries’
underlying actual costs;
(b) The applicants must propose the amount of the lump sum contribution on the
basis of their estimated direct and indirect project costs and in accordance with
the method described in point 3;
(c) The proposal must show the costs and categories of costs covered by the lump
sum contribution, may contain only costs that would be eligible for an actual
costs grant and must exclude costs that are ineligible under the Horizon Europe
rules. Depending on the type of action, these costs and categories of costs may
be the following;
 Personnel costs:
 Employees (or equivalent)
 Natural persons working under direct contract
 Seconded persons by a third party against payment
 SME owners and natural person beneficiaries
 Subcontracting costs
 Purchase costs:
 Travel and subsistence costs
 Equipment (depreciation or full capitalised costs depending on call
conditions);
 Other goods, works and services
 Other cost categories:
 Financial support to third parties (if any)
 Internally invoiced goods and services
 Transnational access to research infrastructure costs (if any)
 Virtual access to research infrastructure (if any)
 PCP/PPI procurement costs (if any)
 Euratom Cofund staff mobility costs
 ERC additional funding
4 ERC additional funding (subcontracting, financial support to third
parties, internally invoiced goods and services)
(d) The granting authority will apply the method in point 3 to fix the lump sum
contribution, based on the proposal and the evaluation result.
(e) The Horizon Europe 25% flat rate for indirect costs, where applicable, and
reimbursement rates are included in the calculation of the lump sum
contribution (see point 3).
Payments do not depend on the costs actually incurred.
The lump sum contribution will be paid by the granting authority, if the corresponding work
packages of the action have been properly implemented in accordance with Annex 1 of the
grant agreement (and provided that all other obligations under the grant agreement have been
complied with).
Lump sum contributions per work package, whose conditions have been met during a
reporting period, are paid to the coordinator.
Lump sum contributions per work package, whose conditions have not been met during a
reporting period, are not paid, but could be paid in the subsequent reporting period if the
conditions are met.
Lump sum contributions per work package, whose conditions are not met in any reporting
period, are not paid and the grant is reduced by an amount up to the value of the lump sum
contributions per work package concerned, following a contradictory procedure with the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned.
The amounts of the lump sum contributions per work package to be used shall be calculated
in accordance with point 3.
2. Justification
The use of lump sum and unit contributions considerably simplifies, streamlines and reduces
the time needed for the financial management of actions, both at granting authority as well as
beneficiary levels. The European Court of Auditors has highlighted the potential of lump
sums, as a major step to decrease administrative burden for beneficiaries, and has already
called for an intensification of the testing on lump sums in the course of Horizon 20204.
2.1. Nature of the supported actions
Lump sum contribution may be used in all actions under the Horizon Europe and the Euratom
programmes as a way of achieving further simplification and stronger focus on the
scientific/technical implementation of funded activities and their outputs generated.
Under the Horizon 2020 Programme – the Framework Programme for Research and
Innovation (2014-2020), a H2020 lump sum pilot was launched to assess the feasibility and
appropriateness of using full budget-based lump sum contribution to cover a single action,
including collaborative actions.
4 See Special report available at:
https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR18_28/SR_HORIZON_2020_EN.pdf.
5The H2020 lump sum pilot was thoroughly assessed based on continuous feedback and
systematic surveys. The results indicate that lump sum funding can be used for any type of
action, including for large multi-beneficiary projects, without increasing burden or decreasing
satisfaction of users. Beyond the positive feedback overall, more in-depths analyses reveal an
even more positive attitude of SMEs towards lump sum funding, and more positive feedback
associated with small to mid-sized budgets and small to mid-sized consortia. This observation
does not exclude lump sums for large and complex grants but may well be taken into account
when identifying suitable programme parts for lump sum funding.
On the basis of data collected (up to June 2021), the lump sum pilot received nearly 1,600
proposals across 16 topics in the Horizon 2020 work programmes of 2018 – 2020, covering
all types of action. These proposals include approximately 4 000 applying organisations,
which show a very similar distribution of organisation types as in Horizon 2020 overall.
There were 524 signed lump sum grants, most of which started in 2019 or 2020.
This pilot experience shows that there is wide agreement among participants and experts
involved in the lump sum pilot, that the Commission provided clear and sufficient information
on the lump sum approach. This includes the briefing for experts. In addition, a majority of
expert evaluators involved consider that the detailed estimation of costs in lump sum
proposals is sufficient, and that the tools provided to enter the cost details and calculate the
lump sum is clear and appropriate to perform a sound evaluation of the lump sum budget.
Furthermore, most of the participants found that budgetary changes, if recommended by the
experts, were precise enough to properly implement them (i.e., changes to the lump sum
requested as a result of the evaluation).
Taken together, these survey results suggest that the financial aspects of the lump sum scheme
are handled properly during evaluation, and they highlight the necessity of sufficient financial
expertise in the lump sum evaluation.
In that respect, calls or topics in the most suitable areas for using lump sum contribution will
be identified in the relevant Horizon Europe Work Programme including the work
programmes of the European Research Council, the European Innovation Council and the
Institutionalised European Partnerships over the period 2021-2027 or in the relevant Euratom
Work Programme over the period 2021-2025. Careful attention will continue to be given to
briefing to evaluators, in particular to ensure appropriate and sound upfront financial
evaluation of the action estimated costs.
2.2. Risks of irregularities and fraud and costs of control
The granting authority will verify at the time of preparation of the grant, during the
implementation of the action or afterwards (through technical checks, reviews or audits),
compliance with the conditions for using lump sum contributions per work package.
As a direct consequence of removing all obligations on cost reporting and financial ex-post
audits, financial error rates will be minimised.
Pre-financing will follow the standard Horizon Europe rules, and will be fixed in the grant
agreement. Between 5 and 8 % of the total lump sum is retained as contribution to the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism.
6There is no report of actual costs, and there are normally no financial checks, reviews, or
audits. Beneficiaries have no obligation vis-à-vis the granting authority to document costs
incurred for the action but they remain subject to the accounting rules under the applicable
national law.
Checks, reviews and audits will focus on the technical implementation of the action, in
particular on the fulfilment of the conditions for releasing lump sum contributions per work
package, or on other aspects of the grant agreement such as ethics and research integrity,
dissemination and exploitation of results, management of intellectual property, and gender
equality.
If such controls reveal that the conditions for payment of the lump sum contribution per work
package had not been met (e.g. a particular work package had not been completed), and that
an undue payment was made to a beneficiary, the granting authority is entitled to recover up
to the amount of the grant.
3. Method to determine and update the amount of the Union contribution in the form of
lump sum contributions
Applicants shall propose the amount of the lump sum contribution on the basis of their
estimated direct and indirect costs. They shall provide a breakdown of the lump sum
contribution showing the share per work package and, within each work package, the share
assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity (if any). The proposal shall describe in detail
the activities covered by each work package and all related resources.
The detailed cost estimation per work package and per beneficiary and affiliated entity (if
any) shall include only costs that would be considered eligible in an actual costs grant.
Ineligible costs shall not be included. Where relevant, applicants shall declare that they have
followed their own accounting practices for the preparation of the estimated budget.
The estimated eligible costs for the action shall be broken down by budget category:
- A. Personnel costs
- B. Subcontracting costs
- C. Purchase costs
- D. Other cost categories
- E. Indirect costs.
Indirect costs shall be calculated by applying a flat rate of 25% to the direct cost categories
that qualify for the calculation of indirect costs under the Horizon Europe rules.
Applicants must prepare their detailed budget by using the relevant templates published by the
granting authority. Their estimated eligible costs for the action must be broken down for the
above-mentioned budget categories and for any related sub-categories mentioned in those
relevant templates.
As a general rule, proposals shall be evaluated according to the standard Horizon Europe
procedures with the help of external independent experts. The experts shall assess the quality
of the proposals in terms of excellence, expected impact and quality and efficiency of the
7implementation. For each work package, experts with the necessary financial knowhow shall,
in addition, check the budget estimate on the basis of relevant benchmarks on costs and
resources such as market prices, statistical data or historical data on previously funded and
comparable actions, and assess whether the resources proposed and the split of lump sum
shares allows achieving the activities and expected outputs. Experts shall verify that proposals
include the declaration by beneficiaries of having used their own accounting practices.
Following proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump
sum taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out (including in case of
recommendations from the experts). If cost items are adapted, the lump sum contribution and
the lump sum breakdown shall be modified accordingly during grant preparation.
The final lump sum contribution shall be included in the grant agreement as the maximum
grant amount. It shall be calculated by applying the reimbursement rate set out in the Horizon
Europe rules to the total estimated eligible costs in the detailed budget table, in compliance
with Article 34 of the Regulation establishing Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme
for Research and Innovation.
4. Sound financial management and co-financing principles and absence of double
financing
The methodology described in point 3 complies with the sound financial management and co-
financing principles and ensures the absence of double financing as required by Regulation
(EU, Euratom) No 2018/1046.
Sound financial management is ensured because the costs estimate in the proposal shall be
detailed and subject to an in-depth check by the evaluation committee to ensure that it
represents an approximation of the actual eligible costs, as described in point 3 above. Any
actions that generate revenue will have those revenues included as part of the estimated
budget and will be taken into account when calculating the maximum amount of the grant.
The external independent experts shall assess the breakdown of shares and ensure that the
described activities correspond well to the estimated budget. Compliance with the co-
financing principle will be ensured during evaluation of the budget by checking that the total
estimated costs of the action is greater than the estimated Union contributions. Moreover,
where the EU contribution covers partially the total costs of the actions, the reimbursement
rates set out in Article 34 of the Horizon Europe Rules for Participation will be reflected in
the calculation of the lump sum.
Double funding is avoided by identifying the project costs that are covered by the lump sum
contributions and is also effectively prevented through controls at the evaluation, grant
agreement preparation, implementation, interim and final payment stages by the granting
authority and the Commission.

Significant simplification potential
● Despite all simplification, funding based on reimbursement of incurred costs remains
complex and error-prone
● Lump sum project funding removes all obligations on actual cost reporting and
financial ex-post audits – i.e. a major reduction of administrative burden
● Access to the programme becomes easier, especially for small organisations and
newcomers
Focus on content
● Less focus on financial management, and more focus on the scientific-technical
content of projectsBasic principles
Lump sum evaluation and grant agreement follow the standard approach with the
same:
• Evaluation criteria
• Pre-financing and payment scheme
• Reporting periods and technical reporting, though focusing on completion of work
packages
One lump sum share is fixed in the grant agreement for each work package:
 Work package completed payment
• Payments do not depend on a successful outcome, but on the completion of activities.
• Work packages can be modified through amendments (e.g. to take into account new
scientific developments)
 No intention and nor basis for judging the performance of lump sum grants more strictly than the
performance of other grants.Two lump sum options

Submission and evaluation of
lump sum proposalsWriting a lump sum proposal
● To write a lump sum proposal, you:
• Use the standard Horizon Europe application form
• Present the objectives and methodology of your project and address the
expected outcomes and impacts as in any Horizon Europe proposal
• Describe in detail the activities covered by each work package
● To define and justify the lump sum, you need to provide a detailed budget table with
cost estimations. The estimations must be an approximation of your actual costs and
meet the eligibility criteria of Horizon Europe. (see Annex from slide 25)
● The detailed budget table is an Excel file. You must download it from the online
submission system, fill it and submit it as an annex to the Part B of your application form.Writing a lump sum proposal
● In this detailed budget table, you provide cost estimations for each cost category per
beneficiary (and affiliated entity if any) and per work package.
● The cost estimations must be an approximation of your actual costs. They:
• are subject to the same eligibility rules as in actual costs grants
• must be in line with your normal practices
• must be reasonable / non-excessive
• must be in line with and necessary for your proposed activities.
● The cost estimations are used to generate automatically a breakdown of lump sum
shares per work package and per participant (i.e., beneficiaries and affiliated entities, if
any). See also slide 14.Project design – Work packages
Work packages distribution:
As many as needed but no more than what is manageable
A work package (WP) is a major sub-division of the work plan of your project.
● A single activity is not a WP
● A single task is not a WP
● A % of progress is not a WP (e.g. 50 % of the tests)
● A lapse of time is generally not a WP (e.g. activities of year 1)
Work packages with a long duration may be split along the reporting periods (e.g., Management,
Dissemination and Exploitation, etc.). In this way, the relevant activities can be paid at the end of the
reporting period.Splitting work packages - example

* Splitting WPs along the boundaries of reporting periods allows activities to be
reimbursed at intermediate payments.
* It is possible that the resulting work packages contain the same tasks (e.g. project
management). In this case, there is no need to repeat the same description for each
split work package in the proposal (part B, table 3.1b).Evaluation of a lump sum proposal
● Your proposal will be evaluated by independent experts against the standard evaluation criteria:
excellence, impact, and implementation.
● The cost estimations will be assessed against the proposed activities under the implementation
criterion.
● Experts will:
• ensure that the cost estimations are reasonable and non-excessive
• evaluate whether the proposed resources and the split of the lump sum allow
completing the activities described in the proposal.
● If the experts find overestimated costs, they make concrete recommendations on the budget that
are recorded in the Evaluation Summary Report. This will be reflected in a modified lump sum
amount in the grant agreement, but the score will not be decreased.
● Serious problems with the lump sum budget (e.g., a budget unfit for purpose or strongly
overestimated costs) lead to a decreased score under the implementation criterion.Horizon dashboard for lump sum evaluations
•
Evaluation experts must use the
dashboard as an orientation to
ensure that personnel costs are
reasonable.
● For each combination of country
and organisation type selected, the

Lump Sum Grant ManagementGrant preparation
● We follow the standard process to prepare the grant agreement.
● The grant agreement for your project will be based on the Model Grant Agreement for lump sum
grants.
● The ‘no negotiation’ principle applies. The grant agreements is prepared on the basis of the
proposal you submitted. However, some changes might be necessary:
• correcting obvious errors and inconsistencies
• other changes necessary to comply with applicable rules
• adjustment of the lump sum to the amount specified in the Evaluation Result Letter
● The breakdown of lump sum shares per beneficiary and per work package is included in the
grant agreement as Annex 2. The submitted detailed lump sum budget table is not part of the lump
sum grant agreement.
● Once the lump sum is fixed in the grant agreement, it will not be questioned if the prices for
goods or services change later on.Art 5.4

• Use the standard reporting template
• The coordinator declares work packages as Completed or Not Completed. This should be justified
by the technical periodic report.
• An incomplete work package can be completed and paid in a subsequent reporting period.
• At the final reporting period, it is possible to declare Partially Completed work packages, and to enter
the percentage of completion.
The completion of work packages is not based on a successful outcome, but on the
completion of activities as described in the description of action.Reporting and payment (2)
• The financial report is much simplified and to a large extent automated.
• The financial statement for all beneficiaries is automatically generated (based on the accepted
work packages and the corresponding lump sum shares).

Payment = 350 000 + 0 + 350 000 + 0 = 700 000 €Acceptance of work packages
• Work packages are accepted if the activities have been carried out. We can also accept them
when all essential tasks have been completed, when equivalent tasks have been carried out, or
when deviations have been justified.
• Lump sum projects can be amended according to scientific-technical needs (or deviations can
be justified in the reports). Use these mechanisms to make completion of work packages feasible.
• Before a lump sum work package (that you declared completed) is rejected as incomplete, you are
invited to respond to the observations of the project officer.
• If the rejection is upheld the lump sum share concerned is not paid at that point in time. You should
complete the work package later and declare it at the end of any subsequent reporting period.
• If it is not possible to complete a work package by the end of the project (e.g., for technical reasons
or due to force majeure), the lump sum is paid partially in line with the degree of completion. The
decision on the partial amount is taken on a case-by-case basis. You will be able to provide
observations.Ex-post controls

Annex – How to fill in the detailed
budget table in lump sum
proposals?What is the detailed budget table for lump sum
proposals?
● To define and justify the amount of the lump sum proposed by applicants, lump sum proposals
type 2 must contain a detailed budget table.
● In this table, you provide cost estimations for each cost category per beneficiary and per work
package.
● The table automatically generates the breakdown of the lump sum per beneficiary and per work
package.
The detailed budget table is an Excel file (annex to proposal Part B). Applicants must download it
from the online submission system.Which costs must be covered?
Cost estimations:
● must be in line with beneficiaries’ normal practices
● must be reasonable / not excessive
● must be in line with the activities proposed
● are subject to the basic eligibility rules of Horizon Europe (cost estimations can be included only if the same
cost item / type of cost would be eligible in an actual costs grant)
Depending on the type of the action, these costs and categories of costs may be the following:
● Direct personnel costs: employees or equivalent (resolved by staff category); natural persons under direct
contract; seconded persons; SME owners and natural person beneficiaries
● Direct subcontracting costs
● Direct purchase costs: travel and subsistence; equipment; other goods, works and services
● Other cost categories: financial support to third parties; internally invoiced goods and services; transnational
access to research infrastructures costs; virtual access to research infrastructures costs; PCP/PPI
procurement costsExcel template: few instructions before starting
• We recommend to use
Excel 2013 or a more
recent version
• The currency used in the
Excel template is EURO
• Read the detailed
instructions on the first
tab of the Excel file
• For your proposal, you
must always use the file
provided in the online
submission system. For
information only, the
template is available on
the Funding & Tenders
Portal.Fill in the beneficiaries list (‘BE list’ sheet)
● To add a beneficiary, double click on the ‘Add BE’ button to generate an additional line to the table. You can
add as many beneficiaries as needed.
● To add an affiliated entity, double click on the ‘Add AE to BEx’ button on the line of the beneficiary to which
the entity is affiliated.
● For each beneficiary and each affiliated entity, write the name and the acronym of the organisation and chose
the correct country and funding rate from the drop-down menus.
● Once you have completed the ‘BE list’ sheet, you must double click the ‘Apply changes’ button to generate
the corresponding sheets in Excel workbook: one tab will be generated for each beneficiary.
Which funding rate to choose? The funding rate depends on the type of action you are applying to. RIA and CSA
topics have a 100% funding rate. For IA topics, the funding rate is 70% (exceptionally 60%), except for non-profit legal
entities, where a rate of 100% applies. Other funding rates may be specified in the work programme. For more
information on the funding rates applying to your topic, please refer to the topic’s specific conditions.Fill in the work packages list (‘WP list’ sheet)
● To add a work package, double click on the ‘Add WP’ button to generate an additional line to the table. You
can add as many work packages as needed. Follow the same order as in the Part B of your application.
● Once you have completed the ‘WP list’ sheet, you must double click the ‘Apply changes’ button: one table per
work package will be added to the beneficiaries’ individual sheets.Fill in the individual beneficiary sheets
(‘BEx’tab)
● Complete one ‘BEx’ sheet per
beneficiary. This sheet includes
one separate section for each
work package. For each work
package in which the beneficiary
participate, enter the cost
estimations under each cost
category used.
● Enter only the number of items
and the cost per item for each
cost category (yellow cells). The
total costs per cost category are
calculated automatically.
● For the cost per item, enter only
whole numbers (integers)
● If the beneficiary does not
contribute to a specific work
package, leave the cells empty.Fill in the individual beneficiary sheets (‘BEx’
tab) – affiliated entities
● If a beneficiary has an affiliated entity, columns for this entity are generated automatically in
the ‘BEx sheet’.
● Enter the cost estimations of the affiliated entity in the same way as for the main beneficiary.Fill in the individual beneficiary sheets –
personnel costs
● Enter the total number of items and the average cost per item for each category of personnel costs
● 1 item = 1 person-month
● For ‘A4. SME Owner and natural person beneficiaries’, the cost per item is predefined
● Personnel costs will be evaluated by experts using the Horizon dashboard for lump sum evaluations, an
orientation tool that shows the average monthly costs for personnel by country and organisation type
● If your personnel costs are higher than the values in the dashboard, you must justify them in the ‘Any
comments’ tabFill in the individual beneficiary sheets –
subcontracting costs
● There is one line for subcontracting per beneficiary and work package (i.e., the amount entered covers all
subcontracting activities for the beneficiary in a work package).
● Enter the number of subcontracted tasks for a given beneficiary and a given work package as number of
items. The cost per item will be an average of the costs of all subcontracted tasks. No more detailed
information is required in the Excel file.
● The tasks to be subcontracted and their costs must be described and justified in the table 3.1g in the part
B of the application form
The costs entered here
must match the costs
entered in the Excel fileFill in the individual beneficiary sheets – direct
purchase costs
● Enter the total number of items and the average
cost per item for each relevant cost category.
● The cost per item will be an average of the prices of all
items in the given category for a given beneficiary and
a given work package. No more detailed information is
required in the Excel file.
● If purchase costs exceed 15% of the personnel costs
of a given beneficiary, this beneficiary must complete
table 3.1h of Part B of the proposal templateFill in the individual beneficiary sheets –
depreciation costs list
● For the category ‘equipment’ (equipment, infrastructure, other assets) you must enter the depreciation costs in the individual
beneficiary tabs.
● Use the ‘Depreciation costs’ tab to calculate the depreciation costs:
• Fill in the information about the beneficiary, the work package, the resource type, the name of the investment and the date of purchase
• Encode the (estimated) price of the equipment in the column ‘Purchase cost’
• Encode the percentage of usage of the equipment for the project in the column ‘% used for the project’
• Divide the period (in months) during which the equipment is used for the project by the depreciation period (in months) for the
equipment. Multiply the results by 100%. Encode the result in the column ‘% use for lifetime of the investment’
● This amount is NOT automatically transferred to the respective ‘BEx’ tab. You have to add manually the depreciation costs in
the dedicated section of the ‘BEx’ tab. If you have several items in the ‘Depreciation costs’ tab for one single section (same
beneficiary, same work package and same resource type), you must enter the number of items and add the average of the
depreciation costs as ‘cost per item’.
● In certain cases, the Work Programme specifies that purchases of equipment, infrastructures and other
assets can be declared as full capitalised costs. In that case, the full capitalised costs must be encoded in the
section “C.2 Equipment”.Fill in the individual beneficiary sheets – other
direct costs and indirect costs
● Certain types of costs can be entered only if they are explicitly allowed for in the specific
conditions of your topic:
● Financial support to third parties
● Transnational access to research infrastructure’ and ‘Virtual access to research infrastructures
● PCP/PPI procurement costs
● Indirect costs are calculated automatically.
● Total costs are calculated automatically.Lump sum breakdown
● The lump sum breakdown table is generated automatically. It displays the lump sum shares per beneficiary/affiliated
entity and per work package
● It applies the funding rate you have chosen in the BE list.
● In the part A of the application (online forms), you have to fill in the ‘Budget for the proposal’ table, entering the
requested grant amount for each participant. To do so, please use the total amounts per beneficiary in the table
‘Estimated breakdown of the lump sum’ in the Excel file.
Excel file Part A (online forms)Summary tables
● The ‘Summary per WP’ and ‘Person-months overview’ tables are produced automatically.
● They will be used by evaluators during the evaluation of your proposal.Uploading the Excel file
● Once you completed the detailed budget table, upload it in the online submission
system, as annex to the part B template.
The format of the Excel template is .xlsm because it uses macros. While you work on it, always save it as .xlsm.
Upload the Excel file in .xlsx or .xls format. For security reasons, you cannot upload the file in .xlsm format.
Always keep a copy of the original .xlsm file.Thank you!

This may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES AND
OTHER PARTICIPANTS
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting
authority for implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance
with all the obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action
under their own responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated
entities or other participants (see Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the
granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the
beneficiaries fails to implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure
that this part is implemented by someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the
maximum grant amount and subject to an amendment; see Article 39). The financial
responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding
the grant for the entire duration of the action. Lump sum contributions will be eligible only as
long as the beneficiary and the action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see
Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the
implementation of the action (see Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the prefinancing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
19Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements
(CFS): not applicable
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article
21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority
under the Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their
affiliated entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and
the granting authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies
otherwise, and in particular:
- submit the prefinancing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
- request and review any documents or information required and verify
their quality and completeness before passing them on to the granting
authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other
beneficiaries (report on the distribution of payments; if required, see
Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other
beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other
beneficiary or third party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii)

10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
[OPTION 1 for programmes without pillar-assessed entities: Not applicable]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with pillar-assessed entities: Pillar-assessed participants (if any)
may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in so far as they have been positively
assessed and do not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle
of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and
procedures which participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control
system, accounting system, external audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and
exclusion, information on recipients and protection of personal data; see Article 157 EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509).

25Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and
procedures, in particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards,
rules and procedures
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in
accordance with usual accounting practices
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, prefinancing guarantees are not
needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their
regular internal or external auditors and in accordance with their internal
financial regulations and procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if
those practices are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no
recovery if the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue
amounts from the third party receiving the support (including legal proceedings)
and non-recovery is not due to an error or negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be
conducted taking into account the rules and procedures specifically agreed
between them and the framework agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the
participant’s internal rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment
will be calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into
before the pre-information letter was received and could not reasonably be
terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated
for damage it sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because
the action was not implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the
damage is due to an infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures
or due to a violation of third parties’ rights by the participant or one of its
employees or individual for whom the employees are responsible.

Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do
purchases, subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance
with their internal rules and procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal
standards, rules and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the
grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use),
communication, dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems,
rules and procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules
and procedures that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately
inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU,
may moreover — under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the
decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries) — rely on the provisions set out in that framework agreement. ]

19.4 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced
(see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 20 — RECORD-KEEPING
20.1 Keeping records and supporting documents
The beneficiaries must — at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6) —
keep records and other supporting documents to prove the proper implementation of the
action (proper implementation of the work and/or achievement of the results as described in
Annex 1) in line with the accepted standards in the respective field (if any); beneficiaries do
not need to keep specific records on the actual costs incurred.
The records and supporting documents must be made available upon request (see Article 19)
or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of
claims under the Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 25), the
beneficiaries must keep these records and other supporting documentation until the end of
these procedures.
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are
considered originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The granting
authority may accept non-original documents if they offer a comparable level of assurance.
20.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, lump sum contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 21 — REPORTING
21.1 Continuous reporting
The beneficiaries must report on the progress of the action (e.g. deliverables, milestones,
outputs/outcomes, critical risks, indicators, etc; if any), in the Portal Continuous Reporting
tool and in accordance with the timing and conditions it sets out (as agreed with the granting
authority).
Standardised deliverables (e.g. progress reports not linked to payments, reports on cumulative
expenditure, special reports, etc; if any) must be submitted using the templates published on
the Portal.
21.2 Periodic reporting: Technical reports and financial statements
In addition, the beneficiaries must provide reports to request payments, in accordance with the
schedule and modalities set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2):
36Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- for additional prefinancings (if any): an additional prefinancing report
- for interim payments (if any) and the final payment: a periodic report.
The prefinancing and periodic reports include a technical and financial part.
The technical part includes an overview of the action implementation. It must be prepared
using the template available in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool.
The financial part of the additional prefinancing report includes a statement on the use of the
previous prefinancing payment.
The financial part of the periodic report includes:
- the financial statement (consolidated statement for the consortium)
- the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table): not
applicable
- the certificates on the financial statements (CFS): not applicable.
The financial statement must contain the lump sum contributions indicated in Annex 2, for
the work packages that were completed during the reporting period.
For the last reporting period, the beneficiaries may exceptionally also declare partial lump
sum contributions for work packages that were not completed (e.g. due to force majeure or
technical impossibility).
Lump sum contributions which are not declared in a financial statement will not be taken into
account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statement (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the
coordinator confirms (on behalf of the consortium) that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the lump sum contributions declared are eligible (in particular, the work packages
have been completed, that the work has been properly implemented and/or the results
were achieved in accordance with Annex 1; see Article 6)
- the proper implementation and/or achievement can be substantiated by adequate
records and supporting documents (see Article 20) that will be produced upon
request (see Article 19) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits and investigations
(see Article 25).
In case of recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the lump
sum contributions declared for their affiliated entities (if any).
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
The financial statements must be drafted in euro.
37Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
21.4 Reporting language
The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
21.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a report submitted does not comply with this Article, the granting authority may suspend
the payment deadline (see Article 29) and apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the
grant or the coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in
Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 22 — PAYMENTS AND RECOVERIES — CALCULATION OF
AMOUNTS DUE
22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.2) and must be distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to
distribution of the initial prefinancing payment; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment
obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date
when they are debited to its account.
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it
turns out that the granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts
undue.
[OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: The general
liability regime for recoveries (first-line liability) is as follows: At final payment, the
coordinator will be fully liable for recoveries, even if it has not been the final recipient of the
undue amounts. At beneficiary termination or after final payment, recoveries will be made
directly against the beneficiaries concerned.
Beneficiaries will be fully liable for repaying the debts of their affiliated entities.
38Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4):
- the beneficiaries will be jointly and severally liable for repaying debts of another
beneficiary under the Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.4)
- affiliated entities will be held liable for repaying debts of their beneficiaries under the
Agreement (including late-payment interest), if required by the granting authority
(see Data Sheet, Point 4.4).]
[OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries: Each
beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is in principle limited to their own
debt and undue amounts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4), affiliated entities will be held liable for
repaying debts of their beneficiaries, if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.4).]
22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Prefinancing payments
The aim of the prefinancing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
For additional prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous
prefinancing payment shows that less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data
Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the 70% threshold and the amount used.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The contribution to the
Mutual Insurance Mechanism will be retained from the prefinancing payments (at the rate and
in accordance with the modalities set out in the Data Sheet, see Point 4.2) and transferred to
the Mechanism.]
Prefinancing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent)
against amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to
that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
In case of beneficiary termination, the granting authority will determine the provisional
amount due for the beneficiary concerned.
39Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
This will be done on the basis of work packages already completed in previous interim
payments. Payments for ongoing/not yet completed work packages which the beneficiary was
working on before termination (if any) will therefore be made only later on, with the next
interim or final payments when those work packages have been completed.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary,
on the basis of the beneficiary’s lump sum contributions for the work packages which were
approved in previous interim payments
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the
distribution of payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments received (if any)}}.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this
amount to be paid to the coordinator (confirmation letter).
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If payment is not made
to the coordinator by the date specified in the confirmation letter, the granting authority may
call on the Mutual Insurance Mechanism to intervene, if continuation of the action is
guaranteed and the conditions set out in the rules governing the Mechanism are met.
In this case, it will send a beneficiary recovery letter, together with a debit note with the
terms and date for payment.
The debit note for the beneficiary will include the amount calculated for the affiliated entities
which also had to end their participation (if any).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.]
40Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible lump sum contributions claimed for work packages
implemented during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out
the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report and the work packages declared.
Their approval does not imply recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or
correctness of their content.
Incomplete work packages and work packages that have not been delivered or cannot be
approved will be rejected (see Article 27).
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the
reporting period, by calculating the lump sum contributions for the approved work packages.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary
termination (if any). The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
[OPTION for programmes with early prefinancing clearing (before reaching the interim
payment ceiling): If prefinancing clearing before reaching the interim payment ceiling is
provided for in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2), the total accepted EU contribution will be
lowered to clear the amount of prefinancing payments previously made.]
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of prefinancing and
interim payments (if any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
41Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the remaining eligible lump sum
contributions claimed for the implemented work packages (if any).
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report and the work packages
declared. Their approval does not imply recognition of compliance, authenticity,
completeness or correctness of their content.
Work packages (or parts of them) that have not been delivered or cannot be approved will be
rejected (see Article 27).
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all
reporting periods, by calculating the lump sum contributions for the approved work packages.
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Not applicable
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Not applicable
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of prefinancing
and interim payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{final grant amount
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments made (if any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): The amount retained
for the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (see above) will be released and paid to the coordinator
(in accordance with the rules governing the Mechanism).]
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
42Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
If [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): — despite the
release of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism contribution —] the balance is negative, it will
be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why
- [OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): requesting a
report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiaries within 30 days of receiving
notification and]
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
[OPTION 1 for programmes without Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations
are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it
has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation letter), together with
a debit note with the terms and date for payment.]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If no observations
are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it
has received) and the coordinator has submitted the report on the distribution of payments, it
will calculate the share of the debt per beneficiary, by:
(a) identifying the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:
{{{total
accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
multiplied by
final grant amount for the
action},
minus
}
{prefinancing and interim payments received by the beneficiary (if any)}
and
(b) dividing the debt:
{{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned
43Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
divided by
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to
point (a)}
multiplied by
the amount to be recovered}.
and confirm the amount to be recovered from each beneficiary concerned (confirmation
letter), together with debit notes with the terms and date for payment.
The debit notes for beneficiaries will include the amounts calculated for their affiliated
entities (if any).
If the coordinator has not submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the granting
authority will recover the full amount from the coordinator (confirmation letter and debit
note with the terms and date for payment).]
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see
Article 25) — the granting authority rejects lump sum contributions (see Article 27) or
reduces the grant (see Article 28), it will calculate the revised final grant amount for the
beneficiary concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the
beneficiary, by calculating the ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total
accepted EU contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its
share in the final grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is
calculated as follows:
{{{total
accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the action}
44Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
multiplied by
final grant amount for the
action}.
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons
why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be
recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent —
against any amounts owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may
be offset before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU
executive agency, debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other
Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) [OPTION 1 for programmes with prefinancing guarantees: by drawing on the
financial guarantee(s) (if any)][OPTION 2 for programmes without prefinancing
guarantees: financial guarantee(s): not applicable]
(c) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of beneficiaries: by
holding other beneficiaries jointly and severally liable (if any; see Data Sheet, Point
4.4)] [OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of beneficiaries:
joint and several liability of beneficiaries: not applicable]
(d) [OPTION 1 for programmes with joint and several liability of affiliated entities: by
holding affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point
4.4)][OPTION 2 for programmes without joint and several liability of affiliated
entities: joint and several liability of affiliated entities: not applicable] or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that the granting authority is the
European Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable
decision under Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and
Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
45Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
[OPTION for programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM): If the Mutual
Insurance Mechanism was called on by the granting authority to intervene, recovery will be
continued in the name of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism. If two debit notes were sent, the
second one (in the name of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism) will be considered to replace
the first one (in the name of the granting authority). Where the MIM intervened, offsetting,
enforceable decisions or any other of the above-mentioned forms of enforced recovery may be
used mutatis mutandis.]
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in
Article 22.5, from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including
the date the full payment is received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and
then against the principal.
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless
Directive 2015/236622 applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by
offsetting or enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission
(see also Article 43).
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the
beneficiaries are entitled to late-payment interest at the reference rate applied by the
European Central Bank (ECB) for its main refinancing operations in euros, plus the
percentage specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The ECB reference rate to be used is the
rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as published
in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the
coordinator only on request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional
and local government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State
for the purpose of this Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not
be considered as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for
payment (see above), up to and including the date of payment.
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.

ARTICLE 23 — GUARANTEES
[OPTION 1 for programmes without prefinancing guarantees: Not applicable]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with prefinancing guarantees:
23.1 Prefinancing guarantee
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2), the beneficiaries must
provide (one or more) prefinancing guarantee(s) in accordance with the timing and the
amounts set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them to the granting authority in due time before the
prefinancing they are linked to.
The guarantees must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal and fulfil the
following conditions:
(a) be provided by a bank or approved financial institution established in the EU or — if
requested by the coordinator and accepted by the granting authority — by a third party
or a bank or financial institution established outside the EU offering equivalent
security
(b) the guarantor stands as first-call guarantor and does not require the granting authority
to first have recourse against the principal debtor (i.e. the beneficiary concerned) and
(c) remain explicitly in force until the final payment and, if the final payment takes the
form of a recovery, until five months after the debit note is notified to a beneficiary.
They will be released within the following month.
23.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If the beneficiaries breach their obligation to provide the prefinancing guarantee, the
prefinancing will not be paid.
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5. ]

The granting authority may — during the action or afterwards — check the proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the obligations under the Agreement,
including assessing lump sum contributions, deliverables and reports.
25.1.2 Project reviews
The granting authority may carry out reviews on the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Agreement (general project reviews or specific
issues reviews).
Such project reviews may be started during the implementation of the action and until the
time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned and will be considered to start on the date of the
notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent, outside experts. If it uses
outside experts, the coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be informed and have the right
to object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of interest.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the
deadline requested — any information and data in addition to deliverables and reports already
submitted. The granting authority may request beneficiaries to provide such information to it
directly. Sensitive information and documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings,
including with the outside experts.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises
(including to the outside experts) and must ensure that information requested is readily
available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested,
including electronic format.
On the basis of the review findings, a project review report will be drawn up.
The granting authority will formally notify the project review report to the coordinator or
beneficiary concerned, which has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations.
Project reviews (including project review reports) will be in the language of the Agreement,
unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
25.1.3 Audits
The granting authority may carry out audits on the proper implementation of the action and
compliance with the obligations under the Agreement.
Such audits may be started during the implementation of the action and until the time-limit set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the beneficiary
concerned and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
The granting authority may use its own audit service, delegate audits to a centralised service
or use external audit firms. If it uses an external firm, the beneficiary concerned will be
48Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
informed and have the right to object on grounds of commercial confidentiality or conflict of
interest.
The beneficiary concerned must cooperate diligently and provide — within the deadline
requested — any information (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or
other personal data) to verify compliance with the Agreement. Sensitive information and
documents will be treated in accordance with Article 13.
For on-the-spot visits, the beneficiary concerned must allow access to sites and premises
(including for the external audit firm) and must ensure that information requested is readily
available.
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested,
including electronic format.
On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which
has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and
will be formally notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed with the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights
of checks, reviews and audits as the granting authority.
25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the
periodic assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.
25.4 OLAF, EPPO and ECA audits and investigations
The following bodies may also carry out checks, reviews, audits and investigations — during
the action or afterwards:
23
- the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) under Regulations No 883/2013 and No
24
2185/96
23 Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September
2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing
Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation
(Euratom) No 1074/1999 (OJ L 248, 18/09/2013, p. 1).
49Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) under Regulation 2017/1939
- the European Court of Auditors (ECA) under Article 287 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 263 of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If requested by these bodies, the beneficiary concerned must provide full, accurate and
complete information in the format requested (including complete accounts, individual salary
statements or other personal data, including in electronic format) and allow access to sites and
premises for on-the-spot visits or inspections — as provided for under these Regulations.
To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the
action, at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until
any ongoing checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have
been concluded.
25.5 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations — Extension of
findings
25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures
described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount
(see Article 22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may
lead to a request for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set
out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities,
fraud or breach of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU
grants awarded under similar conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Findings of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this
grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions, to have committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or
breach of obligations that have a material impact on this grant and
24 Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and
inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests
against fraud and other irregularities (OJ L 292, 15/11/1996, p. 2).
50Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the
list of grants affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to
extend the findings and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of lump sum contributions: the notification will
include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors, to calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or
practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations,
revised financial statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction
method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the
implementation (i.e. start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the
revised financial statements or the announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see
Articles 27 and 28).
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, lump sum contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the
objectives and indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
51Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit
set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or
beneficiaries and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact
of the action, including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may
apply the measures described in Chapter 5.
CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at interim payment, final payment or afterwards — reject any
lump sum contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in particular following checks,
reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant
(see Article 25).
Ineligible lump sum contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The
coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification —
submit observations if it disagrees with the rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects lump sum contributions, it will deduct them from the
contributions declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery;
see Article 22).
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards —
reduce the grant for a beneficiary, if:
52Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and
proportionate to the seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach
of obligations, by applying an individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the
reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving
notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the reduction (payment review
procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the
amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment
cannot be processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or
additional information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing extension procedure,
queries about eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
53Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons
why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will
be lifted — and the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to
confirm if the suspension will continue.
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the
revised report is not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority
may also terminate the grant or the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for
one or more beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make
partial payment(s) for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the
payment (or recovery) of the remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to
be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
54Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the
coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting
authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the
suspension end date.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For
interim payments, the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article
21) must not contain any financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated
entities). The coordinator must include them in the next periodic report after the suspension is
lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of the action — in the last periodic report.
ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional
circumstances — in particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation
impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission
of the amendment request and
- the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately
request another amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption
date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes
necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been
terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the suspension end
date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no work may be done.
Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new work packages may be started.
55Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(c) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 for
programmes with linked actions: [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues:
not applicable] [OPTION 2 if selected for the grant: the linked action (see
Article 3) has not started as specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can
no longer contribute, and this impacts the implementation of the action under
this Agreement]]
(ii) [OPTION 1 by default: additional GA suspension grounds: not applicable]
[OPTION 2 for programmes with additional GA suspension grounds:
[additional GA suspension grounds: insert other grounds]].
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification).
56Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority
will formally notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the
suspension end date and invite the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to
set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the
grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the
suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be before the date
on which the letter is sent.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Moreover, no work may be done.
Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new work packages may be started.
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see
Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a
beneficiary (see Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a
periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of
the report submitted and taking into account the lump sum contributions for activities
implemented before the end of work date (see Article 22). Partial lump sum contributions for
work packages that were not completed (e.g. due to technical reasons) may exceptionally be
taken into account.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only lump sum
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
57Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries,
on request of the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment
request must be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting
period until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary;
change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the
reports submitted in previous interim payments (i.e. beneficiary’s lump sum contributions for
completed and approved work packages).
58Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Lump sum contributions for ongoing/not yet completed work packages will have to be
included in the periodic report for the next reporting periods when those work packages have
been completed.
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into
question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant
termination (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21
(reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27
(rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.3 EU-initiated GA or beneficiary termination
32.3.1 Conditions
The granting authority may terminate the grant or the participation of one or more
beneficiaries, if:
(a) one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 40)
(b) a change to the action or the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership
situation of a beneficiary is likely to substantially affect the implementation of the
action or calls into question the decision to award the grant (including changes linked
to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour)
(c) following termination of one or more beneficiaries, the necessary changes to the
Agreement (and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
(d) implementation of the action has become impossible or the changes necessary for its
continuation would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants
(e) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is subject to bankruptcy
proceedings or similar (including insolvency, winding-up, administration by a
liquidator or court, arrangement with creditors, suspension of business activities, etc.)

(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.)
(k) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in
other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(l) despite a specific request by the granting authority, a beneficiary does not request —
through the coordinator — an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of
one of its affiliated entities or associated partners that is in one of the situations under
points (d), (f), (e), (g), (h), (i) or (j) and to reallocate its tasks, or
(m) other:

32.3.2 Procedure
60Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting
authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will
take effect (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is
discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also
inform the coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit
a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the
basis of the report submitted and taking into account the lump sum contributions for
activities implemented before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Partial lump
sum contributions for work packages that were not completed (e.g. due to technical
reasons) may exceptionally be taken into account.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator
may not submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only lump
sum contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see
Article 28) or to impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority
(see Article 33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —
submit:
61Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open
reporting period until termination, containing an overview of the progress
of the work
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated
beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of
the reports submitted in previous interim payments (i.e. beneficiary’s lump sum
contributions for completed and approved work packages).
Lump sum contributions for ongoing/not yet completed work packages will have to be
included in the periodic report for the next reporting periods when those work
packages have been completed.
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments
within the deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned
and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal
treatment of applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND ADMINISTRATIVE
SANCTIONS
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to
third parties as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross
negligence.
62Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the
beneficiaries or other participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the
implementation of the Agreement.
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a
result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full
compliance with the Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.
The liability does not extend to indirect or consequential losses or similar damage (such as
loss of profit, loss of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by
wilful act or by a breach of confidentiality.
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as preventing the adoption of administrative
sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public
law measures, in addition or as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this
Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to 148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and
Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 2988/9525).
SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot
be considered in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants
involved in the action) and
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without
delay, stating the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force
majeure and do their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.

CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal, in accordance with the
Portal Terms and Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if
explicitly instructed otherwise by the granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the grant agreement (project
number and acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and
Conditions. For naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated —
before the signature of this Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’.
The role and tasks of the LEAR are stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms
and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the
Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of
sending, as indicated by the time logs.
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the
communication is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not
been accessed within 10 days after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general
principles apply (i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with
proof of delivery will be considered to have been received either on the delivery date
registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be
considered in breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Addresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is
the official mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.

ARTICLE 37 — INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT
The provisions in the Data Sheet take precedence over the rest of the Terms and Conditions of
the Agreement.
Annex 5 takes precedence over the Terms and Conditions; the Terms and Conditions take
precedence over the Annexes other than Annex 5.
Annex 2 takes precedence over Annex 1.
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7126, periods expressed in days, months or years are
calculated from the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement
which would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in
the Portal Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries
(see Annex 3). If a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission
must be done by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or
proof that this opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
26 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to
periods, dates and time-limits (OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
65Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45
days of receiving notification (or any additional information the granting authority has
requested). If it does not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same
deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no
notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the
amendment.
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession
form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry
into force of the Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
its entry into force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must
— within 30 days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and
make any changes necessary to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not
affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with
Article 39. It must include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary
directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the
grant to a new beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal
Amendment tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
66Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: [PROGR Lump Sum MGA — Multi & Mono]: V1.0 – 01.11.2024
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE
GRANTING AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting
authority to any third party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority
on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed,
the assignment will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations
towards the granting authority.
ARTICLE 43 — APPLICABLE LAW AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
43.1 Applicable law
The Agreement is governed by the applicable EU law, supplemented if necessary by the law
of Belgium.
Special rules may apply for beneficiaries which are international organisations (if any; see
Data Sheet, Point 5).
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties
must bring action before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice —
under Article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium — unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU
court judgements.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet,
Point 5), the dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in
accordance with the Rules for Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under
Article 299 TFEU (see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the
General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions
against offsetting and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European
Commission (not against the granting authority; see also Article 22).
ARTICLE 44 — ENTRY INTO FORCE
The Agreement will enter into force on the day of signature by the granting authority or the
coordinator, depending on which is later.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
The Online Manual is a user guide that aims to explain to applicants and beneficiaries how EU grants,
procurements and prizes work and how to manage them electronically in the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The Online Manual is limited to procedural aspects and explaining the functionalities of the IT tools behind
the Portal (roles & access rights, proposal submission and evaluation, grant management, amendments,
etc).
Legal and policy aspects are covered rather in other documentation, such as the Rules for Legal Entity
Validation, LEAR Appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment, EU Grants AGA — Annotated Grant
Agreement (which annotates the provisions of the MGAs) and the Programme Guides that exist for some
EU funding programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe Programme Guide, Erasmus+ Programme Guide, European
Solidarity Corps Programme Guide).
A comprehensive list of all relevant documentation (including legislation, work programmes and calls,
guidance and templates) can be found on Portal Reference Documents.
Terms frequently used are explained in the Portal Glossary.

1. My Area — User account and roles
Getting access to My Area
The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is the central electronic portal for all EU funding and
tenders.
It is managed by the European Commission and used by itself and other EU services (together
‘EU’) for their grants, prizes and procurements.
The Portal has two parts: A public section with general information (Funding Opportunities,
Reference Documents, etc) and My Area, which is a secured, personalised section (Portal
electronic exchange system) used by the participants for managing their proposals and
grants/contracts.
For security reasons, access to My Area is based on:
• EU Login account — unique identifier for individuals. All you need to open an EU Login
account is your work e-mail address.
• Roles & access rights (Identity and Access Management System — IAM)
• PIC number — unique identifier for organisations. This 9-digit number is received after
you register in the Portal Participant Register.
In My Area you can:
• get access to non-public information on your proposals, projects/contracts,
organisations, etc
• register in the Participant Register and update your organisation/natural person data
• sign contracts, submit reports, cost claims, invoices and receive payments
• communicate with the EU services about your ongoing projects/contracts
• for experts working with the EU services: register, sign contracts, manage tasks, submit
cost claims and receive payments
• for external audit firms working with the EU services: register and manage tasks
Individual users:
• have to register as a user only once
• will be asked to agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions on their first login
• will have specific access rights, depending on their roles in the
organisation/projects/contracts
Organisations:
• will be asked to agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions when they appoint their LEAR.
1.1 EU Login
EU Login provides a single sign-on to a large number of services and tools available on the
Portal.
5EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
To access to the functions available on My Area, you must have an EU Login account.
• To create an EU Login account, you click on the Register button on the Portal homepage;
all you need is your name and work e-mail address.
• If you already have an EU Login account, you must use that one.
EU Login is the new name for the previously used ECAS account (European Commission
Authentication System); old accounts continue to work, there is no need to create new ones.
Creating an EU Login account
Go to the Portal Register page and enter:
• your first name, last name and e-mail address
• the displayed security code.
Select Create an account
You will receive an e-mail to the address that you specified, containing a link you should
use to complete the registration process.
Click the link you will be asked to choose and confirm a password.
Go back to the Portal homepage.
Click on Login and log in with your registered e-mail (user name) address and
password.
Your EU Login password and user name is personal — do NOT share it with colleagues or
anyone else. All transactions made with your account (user name, password) will be considered
as having been made by yourself. Keep your password secure and change it regularly.
Logging in to the Portal with your EU Login account
After logging in, you can use the personalised services and tools available on the Portal.
Your EU Login account gives you only general access to My Area, but it will NOT yet give you
access to project/contract data of your organisation. This access depends on your roles and
access rights.
FAQ
• FAQ on EU Login help page
1.2 Roles and access rights
Roles and access rights restrict the information a user can view and the tasks they can perform
(for instance, only a person with the coordinator role can delete a draft application).
Access rights are linked to a user's roles in the Portal personalised area (My Area), which are
in turn linked to their functions within their organisation or in relation to a particular
project/contract and their nomination by the organisation’s LEAR (or other authorised person).
6EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
How are access rights managed?
Roles are divided into 2 main sections:
• Organisation roles are linked to the whole organisation and its data (but without any
access to the projects/contracts)
• Project/contract roles are defined first in the proposal, and then transferred to the
project/contract when you have been invited to sign with the EU. They are managed
application by application and project by project, covering all types of access
(read/write/submit).
One user can have several roles at the same time.
How are the roles assigned?
Most of these roles can be freely assigned and managed by you or your organisation, according
to your needs:
• you can start creating an application yourself
• you can be invited by other users who have created an application to join their
application
• persons in your organisation can give you (and revoke) access to roles of your
organisation
• the initiator of an application (or persons in your organisation involved in an on-going
application) can give you (and revoke) access to roles in the application
• persons involved in on-going projects/contracts can give you (and revoke) access to
roles in their projects/contracts.
All access rights are linked to the user's EU Login account.
Exceptions
The EU services intervene in the assignment of the following 2 key roles:
LEAR (Legal Entity Appointed Representative) — organisation role
The LEAR is the person that is officially nominated by an organisation to manage rights and
obligations related to the use of the Portal and to act as main administrative and legal contact
in case of issues. Usually, LEARs are staff members in the central administration of the
organisation. The LEAR handles all the organisation-related data on the Portal and appoints the
persons within their organisation that are allowed to electronically sign grants/contracts and
cost claims.
There can only be one LEAR per organisation.
LEARs are validated by the Central Validation Service as part of the registration in the
Participant Register. Learn more about the detailed procedure for appointing the LEAR.
Primary Coordinator Contact — project role
The Main Contact/Contact Point of the Coordinator/Group Leader in the application will become
the PCoCo (Primary Coordinator Contact). This person is by default the one creating the
application in the Portal and thereby becomes the main person responsible for the application.
As such, they can submit requests, reports and notifications to the EU on behalf of the
consortium.
7EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
There can only be one PCoCo per project/contract.
During the application phase and before call deadline, the PCoCo may transfer this role to
someone else in the application.
Afterwards (i.e. after call submission is closed), a new PCoCo can be assigned only by the EU
Project/Procurement Officer. If such a replacement becomes necessary, the Coordinator should
send a request to the Officer via the Portal Messaging Service (My Projects/My Contracts >
Actions > Manage Project/Contract).
Exceptionally — and only until a LEAR has been appointed — self-registrants have certain
roles (that were not assigned to any of the other users listed above).
Roles — Overview
The picture below shows all the roles involved in managing organisations and projects/contracts
in the Portal.
For some funding programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe ERC and MSCA grants), additional roles
are used. See the for more details.
Organisation roles
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
The LEAR is the formally nominated main responsible for an organisation’s use of the Portal and
thus bears the final responsibilty for all the organisation’s actions in the Portal.
LEARs have system rights to:
• update their organisation's data
• nominate/revoke representatives of their organisation to electronically sign
grant/contracts
• nominate/revoke representatives of their organisation to electronically sign cost
claims/invoices
• nominate/revoke Account Administrators within their organisation to help them with
their work.
8EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The LEAR does NOT assign the Legal Signatories and Financial Signatories for a particular
project/contract. This is done by the Coordinator Contact (CoCo) or Participant Contact (PaCo)
of that project/contract.
Self-registrant
The Self-registrant is the person who first registers an organisation in the Portal Participant
Register.
Before the LEAR is validated, Self-registrants can provide the EU with requested information
and documents about their organisation.
Once the LEAR has been formally validated (normally after the organisation has been validated
by the Central Validation Service), the role of Self-registrant is revoked and replaced by the
LEAR.
Account Administrator
The LEAR may delegate tasks to one or more Account Administrators. Though the LEAR keeps
the full responsibility, Account Administrators can fulfil tasks for their LEAR. An organisation
can have an unlimited number of Account Administrators.
If the organisation nominates a new person as their LEAR, the existing Account Administrators
remain, but can be revoked by the new LEAR.
Legal Signatory (LSIGN)
LSIGNs must be nominated for an organisation by the LEAR or an Account Administrator (see
Figure 3).
LSIGNs are assigned to a particular project by a Coordinator or Participant Contact (see Figure
3). An organisation can have an unlimited number of LSIGNs.
Financial Signatory (FSIGN)
FSIGNs must be nominated for an organisation by the LEAR or an Account Administrator (see
Figure 3).
FSIGNs are assigned to a particular project by a Coordinator or Participant Contact (see Figure
3). An organisation can have an unlimited number of FSIGNs.
Primary Audit Contact (PAuCo) and Audit Contact (AuCo)
Audit roles can be assigned in the Portal only when the organisation is audited.
The LEAR is automatically assigned the Primary Audit Contact (PAuCo), and can nominate other
PAuCos in the organisation.
The PAuCo(s) must also nominate at least one Audit Contact (AuCo) as main contact for audits
on the organisation, and additionally, assign both the AuCo and the audit to an audit team
within the organisation.
PAuCos have the following system rights for their organisation:
• nominate other PAuCo(s) for the organisation and the AuCo(s) for an audit (My
Organisations > Actions > View Roles, click the Roles tab). Detailed explanations are
available in the
• manage the teams in the organisation to assign the audits and the audit contacts to
them (My Organisations > Actions > View Roles, click the Teams tab). Detailed
explanations are available in the
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• revoke other roles
AuCos can nominate other AuCos for the teams to which they are assigned. They can also
revoke other AuCos in their team.
An AuCo assigned to a team has the following system rights for those audits:
• perform the audit tasks for their organisation
• communicate with the EU auditors (receive and send formal notifications, submit audit
documents, etc)
Summary organisation roles
When nominating FSIGNs or LSIGNs, the LEAR can add comments that can help the
Participant Contacts to select the right LSIGN/FSIGN for their project (e.g. "Mr Smith can sign
for projects run by Department X from 1 February 2014."). Such comments can be useful for
defining the scope of responsibilities or duration of FSIGNs or LSIGNs in large organisations
with different departments.
Proposal roles
When preparing your proposal, you will need to define the participating organisations and the
organisation/proposal contact(s). Both are set in the application online form.
For grants and prizes: The proposal will contain the following types of participating
organisations:
• Coordinator. A proposal can have only one, and you may submit an application with just
one Coordinator and no other participating organisations. You need to name a
10EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Coordinator immediately to launch your application, but you can change it later on,
before submission.
• Partner. A proposal can have none, one or more. The number of Partners in an
application (and other aspects such as the country where they are registered, etc) are
subject to the call conditions (i.e. the specific requirements for each call for proposals).
• Partners can also have Affiliated Entities linked to them (through a permanent legal or
capital link or as members of an association; former Linked Third Parties). Affiliated
Entities are allowed to fully participate in the grant and claim costs. They must comply
with all eligibility conditions (same as a Partner).
• Associated Partners. This kind of participating organisation contributes to the project
but cannot claim costs. They are normally not linked to any Partner and do not need to
comply with the eligibility conditions.
Then, you will need to define the contact persons for each participating organisation. There are
two possible types of contacts:
• Main Contact. You need to define one per participating organisation.
• Contact Person. You may define one or more Contact Persons for each Partner. You may
further define their kind of access as Coordinator/Participant Contact (full access) or
Team Member (read-only access).
The roles in your proposal will afterwards become project roles:
• The Main Contact of the Coordinator will become the Primary Coordinator Contact
(PCoCo). This role is automatically assigned to the initiator of the application who
submits the proposal to the EU.
• The Main Contacts of the Partners will become Participant Contacts (PaCo).
• The Contact Persons of the Coordinator/Partners will become Team Members (TeMe) if
they had read-only access in the application form or Participating Contacts (PaCo) if
they had full access.
For tenders:
The tender will contain the following types of participating organisations:
• Group Leader. A submission can have only one, and you may submit a tender with just
one Group Leader and no more participating organisations.
• Group Member. A submission can have none, one or more (often none).
In a call for tenders, you need to provide one single contact: Contact Point. One per application.
This Contact is always linked to the Group Leader.
During the submission phase, this is the only role which will be defined. The Contact Point will
then become the Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo).
Project/contract roles
Depending on your project roles you can have read-only, read-write or read-write-submit rights
to information, documents and online forms.
(Primary) Coordinator Contact (PCoCo/CoCo)
The Primary Coordinator Contact is for each project the main contact between the consortium
and the EU for a particular project/contract. By default, it is the person that creates the
application in the Portal.
11EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The PCoCo can nominate/revoke a Coordinator Contact (CoCo) for the project/contract
(unlimited number possible), who will then have the same rights — except the right to revoke
the PCoCo.
All Coordinator Contacts can:
• nominate/revoke Participant Contacts for other organisations in the consortium
• nominate/revoke Task Managers and Team Members in their own organisation
• assign Legal and Financial Signatories in their organisation to their projects
• make changes to project documents on the Portal
• communicate with the EU services and submit applications and project documents to
the EU.
It is important to list your partner organisations (and their contact persons) relatively early
on in the application process, because this will give them access to the application and allow
them to appoint other roles for their organisation.
Participant Contact (PaCo)
The PaCo is a representative of an organisation in the consortium that is not the coordinating
organisation.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of PaCos per project, and each will be able to:
• nominate/revoke other PaCos in their organisation
• assign Legal and Financial Signatories in their organisation to their projects/contracts
• submit their work to the Coordinator
• nominate/revoke Task Managers and Team Members in their own organisation
• make changes specifically to the participant-related sections of the project documents
on the Portal
• submit information directly to the EU services (if required under the Grant Agreement)
Task Manager (TaMa)
TaMas can perform some restricted actions: creating, updating and uploading documents about
their organisation's participation and completing, modifying or deleting project/contract
information.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of TaMas per project. They cannot nominate or
revoke anybody, nor submit information to the Coordinator or EU.
This role is not used during the application phase.
Team Member (TeMe)
TeMes have limited access rights: search and read-only functions.
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN)
The PLSIGN has the right to sign the grant/contract (and amendments) for a specific project on
behalf of the organisation.
12EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint LSIGNs; the Coordinator and each
participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PLSIGNs for a given project to act as legal
signatory for the participant in the project.
An organisation can have can have an unlimited number PLSIGNs per project.
They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot
assign/revoke any roles.
Project Financial Signatory (PFSIGN)
The PFSIGN has the right to sign cost claims/invoices on behalf of the organisation.
The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint FSIGNs; the Coordinator and each
participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PFSIGNs for a given project to act as legal
signatory for the participant in the project.
An organisation can have an unlimited number of PFSIGNs per project.
They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot
assign/revoke any roles.
Summary project/contract roles
Rights associated with roles
13EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Nomination process
Some roles are automatically given based on the information in your application:
• The proposal initiator will become the Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo).
• The main contact persons in the participating organisations will become Participant
Contacts (PaCos).
• Persons with read-only access to the proposal will become Team Members (TeMes).
Once your organisation is validated by the Central Validation Service, it is important that
you appoint a LEAR to make sure that you can manage the access rights to the Portal.
How to nominate/revoke someone
To grant a role, the LEAR (or other authorised person) must enter the user's e-mail address. It
must be the same as the address the person used to open their EU Login account.
If the person does not already have an EU Login account, they will automatically receive an
invitation to create one.
Organisation roles — to grant/revoke, go to My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation
Roles > Add Roles.
Project/contract roles — to grant/revoke, go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Consortium
> Edit Roles.
How many different roles are needed in a consortium?
A user's EU Login account can carry any combination of roles, this depends on the participants.
Thus, a user can acquire a differentiated set of access rights to different functions for managing
projects, contracts or organisation data.
For small organisations or beneficiaries who are individuals (natural persons), this means
that one single person can combine all the access rights needed to manage their
projects/contracts (i.e. LEAR, CoCo/PaCo, PLSIGN and PFSIGN).
The minimum configuration for a consortium in any given project is:
• 1 Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo)
14EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• 1 Participant Contact (PaCo) per beneficiary
• 1 LEAR per organisation
• 1 Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN) per organisation
• 1 Project Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) per organisation.
One person can have several roles at the same time.
Organisations that participate as Affiliated Entities (or other type of participant — Associated
Partner, Subcontractor, etc) do NOT need any access roles in the Portal, since they are not
allowed to use it. All actions in the Portal are handled for them by the Coordinator/Beneficiary
they are linked to.

1.3 Accepting the Terms and Conditions of Use
The Portal is part of the Single Electronic Data Exchange Area set up under Articles 147 and
128 of the EU Financial Regulation.
On the first login to My Area, users must agree to the Portal Terms and Conditions and the
Portal Privacy Statement.
Organisations will be asked to agree to the Terms and Conditions when they appoint their LEAR
(declaration of consent). Every time you access to My Area, you are implicitly reaffirming
your acceptance of the Terms and Conditions valid at that time.
Personal data will be kept and processed for the purposes of the Single Electronic Data Exchange
Area, i.e. for the management and implementation of your EU grants, contracts, prizes and
other transactions managed through the Portal. The detailed conditions for the processing of
your personal data are set out in the Portal Privacy Statement.
2. Participant Register — Register your organisation
15EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If you want to submit a proposal, your organisation needs to be registered in the Portal
Participant Register and have a 9-digit Participant Identification Code (PIC).
If your proposal is successful, you will receive a notification and be asked to:
• provide supporting documents to confirm the administrative and legal information
declared during the registration (legal entity validation)
• appoint a Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR appointment)
• provide supporting documents to verify the financial capacity of your organisation
(financial capacity assessment, if applicable)
• validate the bank account for payments (bank account validation, only for coordinators).
2.1 Registration and validation of your organisation
Before submitting an application, all participants involved in the proposal must first be
registered in the Portal Participant Register and have their 9-digit Participant Identification Code
(PIC number).
You can verify directly on the Portal whether your organisation is already registered and has a
PIC. If not, please proceed with the registration following the instructions on the same page
(the Registration wizard will help you through the process). Once completed, you get the PIC
to be used in your online application form and further correspondence with the EU services.
If you do not have an user account (EU Login), you will first need to create one, before starting
the registration process. If you already have a user account (EU Login), you can log in and
directly start registration.
Please note that the Participant Register is primarily directed at organisations and that not
all of the labels fit for individuals (natural persons). Enter your information as appropriate (e.g.
country of residence instead of country of registration, passport number instead of registration
number, etc).
What you need to register your organisation
To register your organisation, you will need to provide basic administrative and legal
information, in addition to contact details.
Get ready
Since the declared information will be verified against supporting documents later on, it is
useful to have the relevant documents at hand when you complete the registration, to
make sure you fill in everything correctly (legal form, non-profit, public/private, etc).
16EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Check for already existing PIC
In order to avoid creating duplicate PICs, you should first check whether your organisation
(or another department) is already registered in the Portal and use that PIC.
Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Search a PIC > Search a PIC and put in
your organisation data. Check several variants to make sure there is really no entry.
If no PIC is registered, start registration
Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Register your organisation. The
Registration wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process.
Detailed explanations are available in the .
You do not need to complete the registration process in a single session. You can enter some
information, save it and continue later on. To resume your registration, go to My Organisations
> Continue Registration. Incomplete draft registrations are automatically deleted after one
year.
If you create by mistake a new PIC, see below Data updates.
PIC number
After completing a new registration, you will receive the 9-digit Participant Identification
Code (PIC) — to be used in your online application form and further correspondence with the
EU services.
The newly created PIC will be provisional (declared/non-valid status) until it is formally validated
at a later stage.
Nothing else is expected from you after the PIC has been generated, the Central Validation
Service will contact you later, to initiate the validation process.
Validation of your organisation
If your proposal is successful, you will be contacted for the validation of your PIC
registration data.
Validation is needed only for certain types of participants (grants: Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities; procurement: Contractors). It is not needed for Associated Partners, Subcontractors
or other participants.
It will be done by the Central Validation Service which carries out the validation for all EU
services using the Portal.
The Central Validation Service will contact the person who registered the organisation (Self-
registrant) and ask them to:
• upload official supporting documents (via the My Organisations page)
• clarify any details.
The documents that are required will be listed in the notification you receive. You will need to
fill out a legal entity identification form and provide us with an official VAT document,
registration extract, statutes or act of establishment, etc. The detailed list of documents is also
17EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
explained in the Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity
Assessment.
The Central Validation Service will check that your organisation is legally recognised (has legal
personality). If this is not the case (exceptionally this is allowed), you will have to prove that
the representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on the organisation’s behalf
and that the organisation has financial and operational capacity equivalent to that of legal
persons.
The Central Validation Service will also check whether your organisation qualifies for some of
the special legal statuses that are required for some funding programmes (private or public
body, non-profit, international organisation).
The outcome of this process is the validation of your organisation (validated PIC). The Central
Validation Service will send a confirmation message once the process is completed and the PIC
is validated.
Please don’t forget that all communications with the Central Validation Service must take
place through the Participant Register (My Organisations page). Emails and other
communications will NOT be accepted.
Please also note that if you apply for a call with specific eligibility criteria that are not validated
by the Central Validation Service, these will be checked by the responsible EU service managing
the call — in addition to the validation, which means that they may come back to you with
additional questions.
Validation of the organisation is a prerequisite for the LEAR appointment.
Data updates
Updates to the registered organisation data must be requested via the Participant Register (My
Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation):
• by the LEAR (or Account Administrators) for validated entities
• by the Self-registrant if your organisation has not been validated yet.
If your organisation has already a validated PIC and a new one is created by mistake, your
LEAR or Account Administrator should contact the Central Validation Service via the Portal
Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation). The information will be
transferred from the duplicate PIC to the correct PIC and the duplicate flagged.
SME self-assessment
In addition to the standard validation, a SME self-assessment is needed if you apply for a call
where SME status is an eligibility criterion (or allows for a higher funding rate or other
advantages).
If there is no recent (not older than 2 years) SME self-assessment information available in the
Participant Register, the Portal Submission System will automatically prompt you to go through
the SME self-assessment wizard to establish your SME status. You will need to enter the
financial figures of the last approved accounting period of your organisation and of any other
organisation that might be directly or indirectly related to you. If the result confirms your SME
status, you will be able to proceed with the application process.
Please note that the SME self-assessment is only needed if the SME-status is an eligibility
criterion (or gives special advantages); otherwise, you will simply self-declare your SME status
in the Legal Information tab and proceed with the registration.Detailed rules are explained in
the Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment.

2.2 LEAR appointment and validation
Parallel to the validation of your organisation, you will be requested by the Central Validation
Service to appoint your Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR).
This must be done by a legal representative of your organisation with the necessary legal
authority to commit the organisation for this type of decisions (e.g. typically CEOs, rectors,
Director-Generals, etc... always in accordance with the statutes of your organisation). If
such decisions are normally reserved for joint decision-making by several representatives, the
appointment must be done together (documents signed by all).
The LEAR role, which can be performed by any member of the organisation (typically from the
central administration), is key. They are formally nominated to manage your organisation’s use
of the Portal and thus bear the final responsibilty for all your actions in the Portal. Once
validated, they will be responsible for:
• keeping an overview of all the proposals/projects/contracts your organisation is involved
in
• managing all the legal and financial information about your organisation
• managing the access rights at organisation-level (and read-only access at project-level)
• appointing the persons which will be able to electronically sign grants/contracts (Legal
Signatories — LSIGNs) and cost claims/invoices (Financial Signatories — FSIGNs).
Applicants that are natural persons do not need to prove their capacity to become a LEAR, but
still need to enter their LEAR data and submit supporting documents.
Further details about the LEAR's rights and responsibilities are explained in the Roles and access
rights section.
Appointing and validation of your LEAR
Please note that registration and validation of your organisation is a prerequisite for the
validation of your LEAR.
Identify the person in your organisation who will act as LEAR and the legal
representative who will appoint them
The person who initially registered the organisation in the Participant Register (the Self-
registrant) will receive the notification from the Central Validation Service to launch the
LEAR appointment procedure.
Encode in the Participant Register the name and contact information of the
LEAR and the legal representative appointing them
19EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
To do so, the Self-registrant must go to My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation.
The Participant Register will, then, generate the necessary documents to be signed:
• LEAR appointment letter and LEAR role and duties (generated as a single document)
• declaration of consent to the Portal Terms & Conditions.
The system will automatically check the existence of an EU Login account for the LEAR (e-
mail address, first and last name). In case of inconsistencies, the system alerts the Self-
registrant. If no EU Login account exists, the system will start creating one and the LEAR
will be requested (via a notification e-mail) to finalise it. The LEAR appointment process
will be blocked until this is done.
Get your organisation's legal representative to:
• date, sign and stamp the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR roles and duties
document generated by the system ( both sections must be signed)
• read the Portal Terms and Conditions and
• date, sign and stamp the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions.
Upload the following documents in the Participant Register:
• the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR role and duties (dated and signed by the legal
representative and the LEAR)
• the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions (dated and signed by
the legal representative)
• copies of an official valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport) with a photo and
signature of:
the legal representative and
o
the appointed LEAR
o
• documents proving the authority of the legal representative; these documents
must:
clearly indicate the person’s role/function within the organisation as legal
o
representative
identify and appoint the individual (by name) as the person covering that
o
specific role/function.
Don't forget that you MUST keep the originals of all documents you uploaded, so that
they are available in case of EU controls, checks or audits. Since your registration in the
Participant Register is valid for this and any future EU funding and tenders procedures your
organisation will ever apply for, the originals must be kept permanently, as long as you are
registered in the Portal (and possibly beyond, for controls, checks and audits, etc). You
should therefore NOT throw them away and ensure that they are maintained also in case
of insolvency, takeover or change of control.
Validation of the LEAR appointment by the Central Validation Service
20EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
After receiving the above-listed documents and once the corresponding PIC has been
validated, the Central Validation Service will also validate the LEAR appointment in the
Participant Register.
Activate the LEAR's online user account
After validation, the LEAR account (with the special access rights) can be be activated by:
• following the instructions the LEAR receives by e-mail
• using the account activation PIN code which will be sent to the LEAR by post, or
by SMS if the LEAR's mobile phone number was provided
Should you encounter any problems with the LEAR appointment, please contact the Central
Validation Service via the Portal Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions> Modify
Organisation).
Data updates — Changing the LEAR
If you need to replace an already validated LEAR, you can designate a new LEAR by making a
new appointment (same steps as initial appointment).
If you are a LEAR and your e-mail address has changed, please inform the Central Validation
Service via the Portal Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation),
in order to obtain instructions on how to proceed for the change.
How can you contact the LEAR?
For contacting LEARs of other organisations, go to How to participate > Participant Register >
Search a PIC to find the organisation. Then, select Actions > Contact Organisation. This will
launch a contact form that allows you to send a message to the LEAR (and their Account
Administrators). The LEAR can then contact you directly.
To contact your own LEAR, log in and then go to My Organisations > Actions > Contact
Organisation.

2.3 Bank account registration and validation
Registration and validation of the bank account for payments
In addition to the validation of the participating organisations, we also have to validate the bank
account that will be used for our payments to you (usually bank account of the Coordinator).
The Central Validation Service will contact the Coordinator after the PIC is validated, to enter
the bank account details into the Participant Register and upload the necessary supporting
documents (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you will need
to provide the bank account details and either a bank statement or financial identification form.
21EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The Central Validation Service will cross-check this information and validate the account.When
registering your organisation for the first time, you do not need to declare any bank account
information. You will be prompted to do this only later on, if your proposal is successful.
Data updates
If you need to change an already validated bank account, please declare the new bank account
details via the Participant Register and upload the required supporting documents.
Please note that it can happen that not all types of modifications are supported. In case of an
issue, please contact the IT Helpdesk.
2.4 Financial capacity assessment
Assessment of your financial capacity
For some participants, we will also have to check the financial capacity before awarding
grants/contracts.
For grants, the criteria for checking financial capacity are set out in the call conditions.
Normally, the financial capacity assessment will be done for all Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities, except:
− public bodies (entities established as public body under national law, including local,
regional or national authorities) or international organisations
− if the individual requested grant amount is EUR 60 000 or below.
Specific rules apply for some programmes (i.e. only for coordinators; only for grants above a
certain threshold; State guarantee; see Horizon Europe Programme Guide, Erasmus+
Programme Guide).
The Central Validation Service will contact you during grant preparation to upload the necessary
financial documents (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you will need
to provide documents showing your financial situation for the last two closed financial years
(profit and loss account and balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an approved
external auditor, certifying the accounts for the last closed financial year, etc).
The analysis is based on neutral financial indicators (liquidity, financial autonomy, solvency and
profitability), but will also take into account other aspects, such as dependency on EU funding
and deficit and revenue in previous years. The results of your financial capacity assessment will
be taken into account when evaluating your ability to implement the project (and to take on
the Coordinator role, if it is the case).
If we consider that your financial capacity is not satisfactory, we may require:
– an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several liabiliy for all
Beneficiaries or joint and several liability of Affiliated Entities
– prefinancing paid in instalments (multiple/additional prefinancing)
– (one or more) prefinancing guarantees
or
– propose no prefinancing or
– request that you are replaced or, if needed, reject the entire application.
22EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Specific rules apply to programmes with Mutual Insurance Mechanism (MIM, former Participant
Guarantee Fund; e.g. Horizon Europe). For these programmes, prefinancing guarantees and
joint and several liability of Beneficiaries are normally excluded.
Financial capacity self-check
You can check your financial capacity yourself by using the Financial capacity self-check
simulator.
The self-check is not available for all programmes (because of the algorithms used).
Moreover, it is only a simulation. If a formal financial capacity assessment is required, you will
have to go through the formal procedure.

• Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR appointment and Financial Capacity Assessment
2.5 Data updates
Who can update the online information about your organisation?
• Initially, only the person who first registered the organisation or any other appointed
Self-registrant
• once appointed, only the appointed representative (LEAR) and appointed Account
Administrators.
To change the information on your organisation, go to My Organisations > Actions > Modify
Organisation.
Please upload legal/financial supporting documents for any updates you submit so that the
Central Validation Service can validate them. Maximum size for uploads: 6MB per file
Changes of legal status
If your organisation changes status or address, your LEAR should immediately update the
information in the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation) and,
if possible, directly inform (via your Coordinator) your EU Project Officers in ongoing grants
(Coordinator uses the Portal Messaging Facility: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Process communications > New message).
Some changes like, for instance, partial or universal transfers of rights will moreover require
amendments in case you have ongoing Grant Agreements/Procurement Contracts.
Managing roles in the organisation
If organisation roles need to be changed, your LEAR should immediately update them in the
system (My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation Roles)
If project/contract roles need to be changed, your CoCo/PaCo should immediately update them
in the system (My Projects > Actions > Project Consortium).
If grants/contracts or cost claims/invoices are signed in the system by persons whose access
rights should have been revoked, this will be your responsibility and you will have to bear the
consequences. Their signatures and other actions will be considered valid by the EU services.

2.6 Complaints about validation
If you believe that a validation result is flawed, you can submit a complaint (following the
deadline and procedure set out in the message on the validation result).
Generally, the means of redress are the following:
• request for validation review — within 30 days of receiving the message
• request for review of legality under Article 22 of Regulation 58/2003 — within 1 month
of receiving the message (using the Article 22 complaints form template)
• action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU — within 2 months of receiving the
message.
You are free to choose any of the above means of redress. However, in the interest of good
administration and procedural efficiency, it is recommended to use first the available
administrative review procedures (if any). The objective of these procedures is to re-examine
the circumstances of the validation procedure and to reach a final decision on your registration.
Deadlines for further redress will therefore run as from when you receive our reply with the
final position.
Please note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending are
considered to have been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from opening/access (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
When filing a complaint, please take into account that the formal decision was taken by the
Central Validation Service hosted in the REA executive agency, and that complaints must
therefore be directed against that agency (NOT against the European Commission).
In case you consider that there has been maladministration on the part of the Central Validation
Service, you can also address a complaint to the European Ombudsman — within 2 years after
you became aware of it AND after having used all the means of administrative redress available
(validation review and Article 22 request).

You can access calls and topics in your area of interest through the Portal Search funding &
tenders page. This page allows you to search in the text of the call and topic titles, call and
topic identifiers, topic description and keywords and tags. You can also filter using the quick
search per topics related to specific EU priorities.
If you would like to receive updates on new calls, you can subscribe to the Funding Opportunities
RSS feed.
The Search funding & tenders page also hosts calls for tenders (EU procurements) and prizes.
It does NOT cover financial instruments (EU loans and venture capital) — these are normally
managed through financial partners (banks), but the Portal homepage has a direct link to the
Access to finance page on Europa.
Calls and topics
On the Portal most calls are divided into topics.
Call — Group of topics that are open in parallel and address the same policy domain.
Topic — Part of a call with one opening and closing date. The proposals submitted to the topic
will be evaluated together and compete against each other.
The Search funding & tenders page will display the list of open topics; the name of the call they
belong to is visible on the Topic page.
The Topic page contains all the information you need to have for your proposal (call conditions,
legal framework and key documents, standard application form and other practical information
you need to prepare your proposal). The Topic page also specifies the call deadline and contains
a link to the Portal Submission System, through which you can submit your proposal. The
Topic page also contains call and topic updates (changes or important information for the
applicants).
Deadline for submission
A topic is considered open until the deadline for submission has passed (call deadline).
Each topic will specify deadlines and/or cut-off dates.
Deadline models
Single-stage
For most topics, you must submit a full proposal by the call deadline.
Two-stage
26EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Some topics have a 2-stage submission procedure, which means that you have to submit a
short outline proposal for stage 1 and then a full proposal only if you are invited to stage 2
(meaning that your project looks promising).
Multiple cut-off
Some topics are continuously open, where you can submit a proposal at any time, and cut-
off dates mean that all proposals received by a given cut-off date will be evaluated after that
deadline.
Types of action
Types of action designate funding schemes, i.e. calls with the same characteristics: policy
domain (scope of funded activities), award criteria, reimbursement rate and in some cases form
of funding (budget-based grant, lump sum grant, unit grant, prize, procurement, debt and
equity facility, etc).
The types of action depend on each EU programme.
There are two main types: action grants (for projects) and operating grants (to support
organisations and their running costs).
In addition, most programmes distinguish the following:
• Project Grants
• Lump Sum Grants
• Unit Grants and
• Framework Partnerships.
However, especially larger programmes have developed their own specific set of types of action,
for instance:
• Horizon Europe: Research and Innovation Actions, Innovation Actions, Coordination and
Support Actions, Pre-commercial Procurements, Public Procurement of Innovative
Solutions, etc
• Digital Europe: Simple Grants, Coordination and Support Actions, SME Support Actions,
Grants for Financial Support, Grants for Procurement, PAC Grants for Procurement,
Lump Sum Grants, Framework Partnerships
• CEF: Project Grants, Infrastructure Projects, Lump Sum Grants, Unit Grants, Framework
Partnerships
• Single Market Programme: Project Grants, Lump Sum Grants, Grants for Financial
Support, PPI Grants for Procurement, Framework Partnerships, European Statistics, etc.
Within the types of actions, EU grants fund all kinds of activities (collaborative actions,
coordination and networking actions, coordination and support actions, support to
organisations, technical assistance and capacity building actions, mobility actions, cofund
actions to existing grant schemes/procurements of the beneficiaries, infrastructure actions,
etc).
Technology readiness levels (TRL)
Calls in the field of innovation (close to market) often use the notion of technology readiness
level to specify also the level of technology readiness that is expected from the projects. There
are 9 technology readiness levels:
27EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• TRL 1 — basic principles observed
• TRL 2 — technology concept formulated
• TRL 3 — experimental proof of concept
• TRL 4 — technology validated in lab
• TRL 5 — technology validated in relevant environment
• TRL 6 — technology demonstrated in relevant environment
• TRL 7 — system prototype demonstration in operational environment
• TRL 8 — system complete and qualified
• TRL 9 — actual system proven in operational environment.
3.1.2 Projects that can be funded — Conditions for funding
The types of projects and activities that can be funded are set out for each call in the call
conditions on the Topic page.
The other conditions (eligibility of participants, admissibility requirements, exclusion grounds,
operational and financial capacity requirements, award criteria, etc) are also explained on the
Topic page.
Please note that for some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe, EDF and AMIF), projects may
need to undergo additional checks and procedures before funding can be awarded, such as
specific ethics review, security scrutiny, third country control check, etc.
3.1.3 Apply with partners or as individual
Who can apply?
To see whether your organisation is eligible for funding, check the call conditions on the Topic
page.
In general, most EU funding programmes require that participants (Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities) are:
• legal entities (public or private bodies, including international organisations)
and
• established in one of the eligible countries, i.e.:
EU Member State (including EU overseas countries and territories (OCTs))
o
eligible non-EU countries:
o
EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway — if opted-in for the
o
programme)
associated countries (countries associated to the funding programme by
o
paying a contribution — list differs for each programme).
Please be aware, however, that almost all programmes have additional criteria, which
widen or narrow the group of entities that can apply. Some programmes are open to participants
from the entire world (e.g. Horizon Europe) others are deliberately restricted to EU countries
only (e.g. EDF). In addition, the situation can be different from call to call even within a
programme. It is therefore very important to carefully look at the call conditions.
Moreover, participants must be registered in the Participant Register (mandatory for
Beneficiaries, Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners) and be validated by the Central
28EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Validation Service by the time the grant is signed (mandatory for Beneficiaries and Affiliated
Entities).
Multi-participant or mono-participant actions
Most of the calls for EU grants target multi-beneficiary consortia made up of participants from
different countries — to enhance the EU added value, promote cooperation between
organisations in different countries, reinforce the quality of applications and ensure fair
competition and equal opportunities throughout the EU.
Some programmes formalise this, by adding specific requirements for the consortium
composition (e.g. Horizon Europe, UCPM, etc).
To see whether a call requires minimum consortium composition, check the call conditions on
the Topic page.
How to find partners for your project ideas?
To find partners for your project ideas, you can:
• Use the Partner Search function of the Portal. The function allows to:
look for organisations which received funding in the past
o
create and check Partner Search requests by call/topic
o
• Use other Partner Search tools and services. A list of recommended support sites is
offered under the Helpdesks & Support Services page.
• Participate in conferences, brokerage events organised by the EU or networks in the
Member States (National Contact Points or Desks, Enterprise Europe Network, etc).
Portal Partner Search
If you want to find experienced partners who already have ongoing projects, or if you want to
browse in the database of registered organisations, visit the Partner Search page. You can
search by keyword/geographical area/funding type, etc. Search results include complete
organisation profiles with lists of funded projects and the possibility to contact representatives.
If you have selected your area of interest via the Topic search, you may publish your
offer/interest for one or more of the open/forthcoming topics of a call on the Portal. All your
published offers/interests will be visible on your organisation's page too.
Enterprise Europe Network Cooperation Opportunities Database — The Enterprise Europe
Network (EEN) publishes an extensive number of innovation and technology profiles from
international companies and research organisations to help identify suitable partners for
bilateral business, innovation and technology cooperation. The EEN database is updated with
new profiles on a weekly basis. All profiles are published anonymously. Express your interest in
collaboration by filling in and sending the Expression of Interest form to your local EEN office,
who will establish the contact.
Consortium roles and responsibilities
When setting up your grant consortium, you should think of organisations that help you reach
objectives and solve problems.
29EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Beneficiaries — Affiliated Entities — Associated Partners —
Subcontractors
The roles should be attributed according to the level of participation in the project. Main
participants should participate as Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities (former Linked Third
Parties); other entities can participate as Associated Partners, Subcontractors, Third parties
giving in-kind contributions, etc.
Associated Partners and Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not get any part
of the grant money and will therefore have to organise other funding sources (bear their own
costs, internal reallocation of funding inside the consortium, find investors, etc).
Subcontracting should normally constitute a limited part of the project and will need to
be justified (give reasons). Tasks may NOT be subcontracted inside the consortium (between
Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities).
Coordinator — Other Beneficiaries
The Coordinator is responsible for managing the project, submitting reports and deliverables
and acting as intermediary for all contacts with the EU Granting Authority.
The other Beneficiaries must implement their part of the project and contribute to the grant
administration (preparing the grant, reporting, etc).
The consortium participants will be jointly responsible for implementing the project activities
(in accordance with their proposal/description of the action). If a project is not finished (or badly
implemented), the grant money may have to be reduced for everyone.
3.1.4 Submit a proposal — Portal Submission System
Proposal submission
Proposals must be submitted electronically using the Portal Submission System.
Where? Access to the Submission System is available through the Topic page on the Portal>
Start Submission.
Who? Proposals must be created and submitted by a contact person of the coordinating
organisation. Exceptions exist for some programmes/types of action which are fully focused on
individuals (e.g. the Principal Investigator in Horizon Europe ERC grants or the Fellow in Horizon
Europe MSCA grants).
How? The Submission wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process. You will need
to use the online forms and templates available in the Submission System. The application form
is described below.
Submission process
Get prepared: Finding your topic > Find partners > Plan your work and budget
Electronic proposal submission: Get an EU Login account > Get a PIC number (Participant
Register) > Launch Submission wizard > Pre-register your draft proposal > List participants,
contact persons > Fill in Administrative Forms (Part A) > Upload Technical Description (Part B)
> Submit your proposal > Acknowledgement of receipt
Application form (Part A and B)
30EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Proposals are submitted using the application forms available in the Submission System. The
application form is structured in into two parts, Parts A and B:
• Part A: contains the structured Administrative Forms with data on the participants, legal
declarations and contact persons (retrieved from the Submission System screens). It
may also include some programme-specific questions.
• Part B (the narrative part): Technical Description of the project with the planned
activities, work packages, costs, etc (must be uploaded as PDF).
Part A is generated while entering the data into the Submission System; Part B needs to be
prepared in advance (using the template downloaded from the system; do NOT use the standard
template from the Topic page).
Part B will also include annexes and supporting documents if required by the call conditions
(detailed budget table, declarations from national authorities, CVs, annual activity reports, etc).
All participants can contribute to the parts, but it is the person from the coordinating
organisation who created the application who must finalise and submit the application.
For programmes with specific security requirements, special instructions may apply (e.g. for
EDF, documents must be uploaded through a password-word protected zip file). For such
programmes, detailed instructions will be available in the call documentation.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Mandate: Make sure that you have the mandate of all participants to submit the
application (explicit agreement to participate).
• Quality check:
Check that the application is coherent and that Part A and B are consistent (especially
budgetary information).
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed; make
sure that no annexes are missing.
Confidentiality
EU services will treat your proposal confidentially, as well as any related information, data
and documents received.
Our evaluators (both in-house and outside experts, if any) are also bound by an obligation of
confidentiality.
Please do NOT discuss your proposal with persons that might act as expert evaluator for us
or be otherwise involved in the evaluation, since this could lead to a conflict of interest with
adverse consequences both for you and the concerned person.
Security, data protection and document retention
Your proposal and all the information received from you will be stored under secure conditions
at all times. The Portal is a closed, secured platform with multiple safeguards.
After the evaluation, we will keep the proposals for audit trail purposes (at least 5 years for
unsuccessful proposals and 10 years after project end for successful proposals and, possibly,
longer if needed for controls, checks and audit purposes).
Personal data will be handled according to the standards set out in Regulation No 2018/1725
and in line with the Portal Privacy Statement.
31EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please be aware that your proposal MUST NOT contain any classified information (Decision
2015/444 or national rules).
Access to proposals
The proposals will remain sealed and closed until after the call deadline.
However, in order to plan the evaluation process (organise translations, evaluation capacities,
evaluators with specialist knowledge, etc) we will ask you for permission to access to certain
information already before:
• call title and topic for which the proposal is submitted
• title of your application, proposal abstract, keywords
• PICs of the participating organisations
• relevant panel (for proposals submitted to specific panels, e.g. Horizon Europe MSCA,
UCPM).
A warning will inform you that the Granting Authority will be accessing this information and
will give you the opportunity to refuse access.

3.1.4.1 Get prepared
Before you can start completing your application, you should study the call documentation,
select partners and plan your project.
Study the call documentation
Choose your topic, and then read carefully the related documents and standard
templates that are available on the Topic page.
The Submission System will check some basic admissibility and eligibility requirements,
but NOT all of them. It is therefore very important that you carefully read the call
conditions. Please note that whenever there is a contradiction between the IT checks in
place and the call documentation, the call documentation prevails.
Select your partners for the project
Most calls require several participants in the proposal (see call conditions on the Topic
page).
You can use the Portal Partner Search to find partners. Other partner search tools are
explained in the Helpdesk & Support Services page.
Plan your project and prepare the Technical Description (Part B)
Planning of the work (work packages, deliverables, milestones)
32EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Look at the call conditions, award criteria and standard application form (Technical
Description (Part B)) on the Topic page.
For most types of action the Technical Description must give a detailed description of the
project idea and work plan (work packages, milestones and deliverables, division of
responsibilities and resources, time schedule, project management structure,
dissemination and communication activities).
Work packages
All project activities should be grouped in a logical, consistent and structured way into
separate work packages. All work packages must present a clear, logical link to the
project objectives and to the other work packages. Ideally, each work package should
constitute a sub-part of the project, a step leading to the achievement of the project’s
overall goals.
Projects should normally have at least 2 work packages:
− work package 1 — management and coordination activities
− work package 2 — outputs related to the project goals.
Beyond that, create only as many as you need (as many as necessary, as few as
possible).
Work package 1 should normally cover all activities related to the general management
and coordination of the project and any activities that do not relate to any of the work
packages leading to a specific result, but which are directly linked to the project as a whole.
For the other work packages, describe the:
• objective(s)
• activities to be implemented — in specific terms
• (tangible and intangible) outputs to be produced.
Milestones & deliverables (if required)
Concerning the outputs:
1. Distinguish between milestones and deliverables:
− milestones: control points in the project that help to chart progress (kick-
off meetings, steering committes, first-draft of a survey, prototype, etc)
− deliverables: outputs to be submitted to the EU (publication, leaflet,
progress report, brochure, list, etc)
2. Be as specific as possible, e.g.:
− events — the number of events, title, content, duration, number of
participants, etc.
− publications — number of pages, language, format (printed/electronic),
number of printed copies (in each language), etc.
3. Be realistic about what you can achieve within the project duration. The scope of
your project should be large enough to make a difference, but it doesn't need to produce
an excessively high number of outputs.
4. Refer only to major outputs. Do NOT include minor sub-items, internal working
papers, meeting minutes, etc. Adapt the number of deliverables to the size of your
33EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
project and work packages (use as many as necessary, as few as possible). You may
be asked to reduce or increase the number during grant preparation.
Budget
Look at the budget table in the Administrative Forms (Part A) in the Submission System.
Only the white cells need to be filled in (the grey cells are not applicable or automatically
filled by the system).
Cross-check with Part B to see if you will also need to submit a detailed budget table or
outline budgetary details also in Part B.
The budget categories to be used for the call are set out in the call conditions and explained
in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
The budgeted costs should be based on a detailed and accurate estimation of your
estimated project costs (based on the cost eligibility rules set out in the Grant Agreement).
They should include all your estimated costs (those of your Affiliated Entities should be
presented separately, for each participating entity).
Keep your estimates on file — you may be required to produce them later on.
Annexes & supporting documents
If required by the call conditions, you will need to prepare additional annexes and
supporting documents (consortium description, declarations by the national authorities,
CVs, annual activity reports, etc).
Use the templates provided inside the Submission System (NOT the ones on the Topic
page).
Detailed budget table (if required)
Many programmes require the submission of a detailed budget table (templates are usually
in format .xlsx or .xlxm).
Simple .xlsx files can simply be filled-in, merged and uploaded. For .xlsm files, you can
usually — after the table has been filled-in and completed using the macro-support — save
a copy as .xlsx and use that copy for merging and uploading the file.
If you are asked to merge and upload a table as PDF (usually for needed for GAP), please
proceed as follows:
Sheets per participant must be filled in for each Beneficiary/Affiliated Entity; sheets for
the entire project must be filled in by the Coordinator — after having received all the
information by the other participants.
Combine into a single PDF:
1. Save participant sheets into one PDF per Beneficiary/Affiliated Entity (choose
sheets via ‘Options’ when saving as PDF)
2. Save participant sheets and project sheets into a PDF for the Coordinator.
3. Combine into a single PDF for upload (using Adobe Acrobat or the Preview App
on Apple Macs).
4. Upload in the system.
CVs (if required)
Provide CVs for the core project team (these are the key staff you have listed in part B and
may include outside experts, if key to your proposal).
34EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
You can submit CVs in any format. If standard CVs are required in the call conditions we
strongly recommend you to use the Europass format. If short outlines are requested, there
are no specific formatting requirements (but please keep the information on each person
to name, birthdate and 1-2 paragraphs describing studies and most relevant work
experience).
As far as possible, upload them in a single PDF file, rather than individually.
If you are still recruiting, please provide the job profile.
Activity report of last year (if required)
This report should describe your organisation's activities for the last year.
It should be detailed enough to allow us to check your organisation’s aims and activities
and its operational and professional capacity.
No finalised annual report yet? Submit the draft version, certified by your organisation's
legal representative.
No report of this type available? Create one for this application and have it certified by your
legal representative.
Online versions — If your report is available on your website, you can just provide a link
(directly to the document(s), not simply to the homepage) and indicate the link on a
separate sheet and upload it as annex (PDF format).
3.1.4.2 Electronic proposal submission
Electronic proposal submission: Get an EU Login account > Get a PIC number (Participant
Register) > Launch Submission wizard > Pre-register your draft proposal > List participants,
contact persons > Fill in Administrative Forms (Part A) > Upload Technical Description (Part B)
> Submit your proposal > Acknowledgement of receipt
Proposals must be submitted online using the Portal Submission System and before the call
deadline.
Details are explained in the .
Actions to be completed before submission
Create your user account to login to the Portal
To be able to submit a proposal, you must first register on the Portal for an EU Login account.
Make sure all participants are registered (PIC)
All participants (Beneficiaries, Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners) must be
registered in the Participant Register and have their 9-digit Participant Identification Code
(PIC). The Coordinator has to be identified with its PIC number at Step 3 of the Submission
wizard, while other participants at Step 4.
Read more about registration and PIC search in the Registration and validation of your
organisation section.
Submitting the application
35EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The Submission wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process.
Detailed explanations are available in the .
Do not forget to check the system requirements for using the Submission System.
Launch the Submission wizard and enter information for the Administrative
Forms (application form (Part A))
Go to the topic on the Search funding & tenders page > Start Submission.
Upload Part B (Technical Description) and annexes and supporting documents
Part B (and the annexes and supporting documents) can be uploaded in Step 5 of the
wizard. Detailed instructions for preparing these documents are available in the section Get
prepared.
Tips
Do not wait until the end to submit
It is highly recommended to submit your proposalas early as possible and at least 48 hours
before the deadline. This will avoid technical problems (system requirements, local
configuration settings, system congestion, etc).
Please note that you can submit the proposal as many times as you want. Every submitted
version will replace the previous one. Your proposal is sealed and closed. It will not be accessed
before the deadline of the call. There is no reason to delay submission for fear of disclosure.
Affiliated entities
In Step 4 of the wizard you specify the organisations participating in the consortium. As from
2021, this will include Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners. They will therefore need to
have registered beforehand and have their PIC. Their budget will also have to be individualised
already at application stage (separate row in the budget table).
Access rights of individual contact persons
In Step 4 of the wizard you also specify the contact persons for the organisations. To read more
about the levels of access rights, see the Roles and access rights section.
Changes to organisation-related data during proposal preparation
If your organisation is already registered, but organisation-related data has changed during
proposal preparation, you cannot update it directly in the Submission System.
The update must first be requested via the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions >
Modify Organisation):
• by the LEAR (or Account Administrators) for validated entities
• by the Self-registrant if your organisation has not been validated yet.
Page limits and formatting requirements for the Technical Description (Part B)
Don’t forget that applications may have mandatory page limits and formatting requirements
(indicated at the beginning of the application form). Excess pages will be automatically made
invisible, and will not be taken into consideration by the evaluators.
36EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Checklist for submission
Before submitting the proposal, check that:
• your proposal fulfils the call conditions
• the proposal (both the Administrative Forms (Part A) and Technical Description (Part
B)) is complete, readable, accessible and printable
• the requested declarations have been made
• all consortium members have:
obtained a user account to log in to the Portal
o
registered in the Participant Register.
o
Mock evaluation
For some programmes, you can find standard evaluation forms similar to those used by our
evaluators on Portal Reference Documents. Try them out. Ideally, ask a disinterested colleague
to carry out a mock evaluation.
Multiple versions of proposal
You can submit your proposal several times before the deadline, to make updates or changes.
To view or change your submitted proposal, go to My Proposals > View Submitted > Re-edit
proposal. As long as the call has not been closed, the newly submitted version will overwrite
the previous one.
Please note that the re-edit functionality is not available for continuously open calls.
Multiple proposals
If the Coordinator submits a number of similar proposals, the Granting Authority may ask them
to choose one or more of them to be withdrawn.
Specific submission schemes
Two-stage submission schemes — You must submit a short outline proposal for stage 1 and will
be invited to submit a full application only if you pass to stage 2. The full application must be
consistent with the short outline proposal (no substantial differences allowed).
Calls with multiple cut-off dates — The call has a final closure date (usually the end of the
funding programme) and several cut-off dates that trigger evaluation. There is an evaluation
session after each cut-off date and the final closure date (normally within a month). After each
cut-off date, the submitted proposals are grouped, reviewed and ranked together. Evaluation
results are made available and proposals invited for grant preparation. If you miss a cut-off
date, the proposal will be evaluated with the next batch in the next evaluation session.
After submission
At submission, the application package is combined into one document, sealed and an e-receipt
is generated (with date and time of submission).
All contact persons of the coordinating organisation will receive an e-mail (after each submission
if several). If you have not received this e-mail, the application has not been submitted.
Please try again or contact the IT Helpdesk.
After the submission, there is normally no further contact between you and us until after the
end of the evaluation. The competent EU service will contact you only if there is a need to clarify
issues or request additional information or if the call foresees a hearing/interview as part of the
evaluation procedure.
37EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Withdrawal of submitted proposals
Before the call deadline, a proposal can be withdrawn at Step 6 of the wizard (My Proposals >
View Submitted > Withdraw proposal). After the call deadline, withdrawal has to be requested
via the IT Helpdesk.
Once withdrawn, the new status will be shown on the My Proposals page (and you can delete
the application with the Delete button).
After the call deadline
Once the call deadline has passed, no further corrections or re-submissions are possible.
However, you can have read-only access to the submitted proposal (My Proposals > View
Submitted).
Proposals that were never submitted (remain in draft status) are accessible for 90 days after
the call deadline (My Proposals > View Draft).
3.1.5 Complaints about failed submission
If you think that submission of your proposal failed and this was due to a technical error on the
Portal side, you may lodge a complaint through the IT Helpdesk.
The complaint must be filed within 4 calendar days after call closure. You will receive an
acknowledgement of receipt the same or next working day.
What else to do? You should secure a PDF version of the part B and annexes of your application
holding a time stamp before the call deadline (file attributes listing the date and time of creation
and last modification), as well as proof of the alleged failure (screenshots). You may be
requested by the IT Helpdesk to provide these items.
EC services will check the IT logs (application log files and access log files of the Commission
IT systems involved) and see if they show a technical problem on the Portal side which
prevented you from submitting (or resubmitting) the proposal.
You will be notified about the outcome as soon as possible.
If your complaint is justified, the files you provided to the IT Helpdesk will be used as your
proposal and sent for evaluation. If you didn’t provide any files, the last version recorded in the
IT system will be used.

• Proposal Submission System: User Manual
3.2 Selection — From evaluation to grant signature
3.2.1 Admissibility and eligibility check
Once you have submitted a proposal, the Granting Authority will check:
• admissibility (complete and properly put together) and
• eligibility (fulfills eligibility conditions)
and then
• ask an independent evaluation committee to evaluate it.
38EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Admissibility criteria
The admissibility conditions are set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.
They are generally the same across all EU programmes. The proposal must:
• be submitted through the online Submission System before the call deadline
• be complete — application form correctly filled out, all sections of Parts A and B
completed, all annexes and supporting documents provided
• be readable, accessible and printable.
Furthermore, the proposal should respect the page limit set out in the application form. Excess
pages will be automatically made illegible, and will not be taken into consideration by the
evaluators.
Eligibility criteria
The eligibility criteria are also set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.
The basic eligibility check involves for most EU programmes if the content of the proposal is in
line with the topic description and if it involves participants coming from the right countries.
Additional criteria depend on the programme or specific topic (i.e. minimum consortium
composition, type of participant, geographic location of the project activities, coordinator from
an EU country, etc.).
For more information on participation of non-EU participants, see Who can apply section.
Outcome of the admissibility and eligibility check
If a proposal is inadmissible or ineligible, the participants will be informed (through the
coordinating organisation) and the rejection letter will be posted in their Portal library (My
Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Documents).
For complaints procedures against such rejections, see section Complaints about proposal
rejection.
3.2.2 Evaluation
Admissible and eligible proposals are sent on to evaluation by an independent evaluation
committee.
For most programmes the evaluation committee (panel) is made up of EU staff from the
Granting Authority and other services. They are often and assisted by outside experts for
individual evaluation and consensus group evaluation. For some programmes however (e.g.
Horizon Europe), the committee is usually composed exclusively of outside experts — for all
stages of the evaluation process (no internal staff).
The evaluation committee will also take position on the operational capacity of the consortium
and individual participants to properly implement the tasks planned. This assessment will be
based on the competence and experience of the participants, including operational resources
(human, technical and other) and is, for many programmes, integrated into the award criteria.
3.2.2.1 Award criteria
39EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Award criteria, scores thresholds and weighting
Proposals are evaluated and scored against award criteria set out in the call conditions on the
Topic page.
The award criteria, scores, thresholds and weightings depend on each programme and type of
action.
Globally speaking most programmes evaluate the following quality parameters: project
relevance, quality/implementation and impact. But in practice the labels vary and the
parameters are broken down into different aspects and focal points (see call conditions and, for
some programmes, the Programme Guides, e.g. Horizon Europe Programme Guide, Erasmus+
Programme Guide, AGRIP Programme Guide).
To be considered for funding, your proposal must score above a certain threshold for each
individual award criterion, and above an overall threshold for all of them together.
Moreover, in order to receive funding, your proposal must be ranked sufficiently to be above
the budget-threshold (relative positioning in the list of all proposals, compared to the other
proposals). For calls which provide for weightings, this ranking will also depend on the
weighting.
Your proposals will be evaluated on its own merit, and not its potential should certain
changes be made. Proposals with an inflated budget are likely to receive a lower score.
3.2.2.2 Evaluation and evaluation results
Evaluation process
Briefing
Evaluation: Individual evaluation > Consensus group > Panel review
Briefing of evaluators
Before starting the evaluation process, the evaluators are briefed on:
• the evaluation processes and procedures (including award criteria)
• the content of the topics under consideration
• the need to evaluate proposals as they were submitted, rather than their potential
should certain changes be made
• for outside experts: the terms of their contract (confidentiality, impartiality, conflicts of
interest, completing tasks and approving reports, penalties for non-compliance, etc).
For most EU programmes, there is no scope for recommending improvements to proposals
(including improvements on the budget).
Individual evaluation
During the individual evaluation, the evaluators work individually. Each evaluator gives a score
for each criterion, with explanatory comments, and prepares an individual evaluation report
(IER).
40EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Proposals are normally evaluated by at least three individual evaluators (for some programmes
and types of action, two may suffice; for many it is five).
The evaluators should also indicate if they consider that the proposal:
• is out of scope or
• involves security issues that will need further scrutiny.
Consensus group
After the individual evaluation, all evaluators who have evaluated the proposal will get together
in a consensus group, to agree on a common position on comments and scores.
For consensus groups made up of outside experts, the group will normally be assisted by a
member of the Granting Authority staff who will act as moderator to:
• seek a consensus, impartially and
• ensure that each proposal is evaluated fairly, according to the award criteria.
Panel review
After the consensus phase, the evaluation committee (panel) will take over and discuss the
proposals to:
• reach an agreement on the scores and comments for all proposals evaluated together,
checking consistency across the evaluations
• if necessary, propose a new set of marks or revise comments, and resolve cases where
evaluators were unable to agree
• rank the above-threshold proposals and give a priority order for proposals with the same
score.
Proposals with the same score
The evaluation committee will recommend a priority order for proposals with the same score,
using the procedure set out in the call conditions.
Interviews/hearings
If provided for in the call conditions, the evaluation committee (panel) may arrange
interviews/hearings.
In this case, invitations are sent to the coordinators of above-threshold proposals (and,
sometimes, also to those with scores above individual thresholds but below the overall
qualifying threshold).
The interviews/hearings may be held remotely or on site, in Brussels.
The questions to be asked will be determined by the panel beforehand and sent to all proposals.
The interviews/hearings will be used to get further information to clarify the proposals and help
the panel establish its final ranking list and scores. They may not serve to change proposals or
add missing information.
Outcome of evaluation
41EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
On the basis of the report and ranked list provided by the evaluation committee (panel), the
Granting Authority reviews the evaluation result, puts together the final ranking list and
informs the participants.
You can find the timing the evaluation and information on evaluation results in the call
conditions on the Topic page.
Final ranking — Reserve list — Rejections
The Granting Authority produces the final ranked list and the list of applications proposed
for funding.
The number of proposals in the list depends on the available budget. If the available budget is
too small to fund all above-threshold proposals (normally the case because EU grants are
heavily oversubscribed), some proposals may be put on a reserve list. These will then be
offered funding if a higher-scoring project does not go ahead or additional funds become
available.
The below-threshold proposals will be rejected.
Proposals will NOT be offered funding if the Granting Authority finds that it is already funding
very similar work elsewhere, or a proposal is in any way manifestly contrary to EU general
principles or established EU priorities or policies.
Evaluation result letters — Evaluation summary report
The participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) about their evaluation
result (together with the evaluation summary report (ESR)) and it will be posted in their Portal
library (My Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation >
Documents).
If your proposal was successful, you will get a grant preparation invitation letter. To follow
the further steps of preparing your grant, you will be prompted for each of the actions that need
to be carried out. Details are explained in the next section Grant preparation.
42EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please note that invitation to grant preparation is NOT a formal commitment for funding. The
final decision on your project will only be taken at a later stage — this depends on the finalisation
of grant preparation and further checks which we still need to make (i.e. financial capacity, non-
exclusion, etc).
If your proposal was not succesful, you will receive a rejection letter. The means of redress for
such rejections are described in the section Complaints about proposal rejection.
3.2.3 Special procedures: Ethics review, security scrutiny,
Ownership control check
Ethics review
In order to avoid funding of ethically problematic activities, some funding programmes require
an ethics review procedure to clear the projects (e.g. Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, EU4H,
AMIF).
The details and the scope of the ethics review depend on each programme. Most programmes
simply check whether projects raise ethics issues and, if so, whether these are adequately
addressed. Some programmes, such as Horizon Europe, have a more elaborated review
procedure which includes several steps depending on the complexity of the issues (see Horizon
Europe Programme Guide).
The participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) of the ethics review
result and it will be posted in their Portal library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Document Library).
If the ethics review leads to requirements to be implemented before grant signature, you will
need to take immediate action to comply (and may also have to adapt the description of the
action (DoA Part B) to reflect this). If the review leads to additional requirements to be fulfilled
during the project, they are automatically added as ethics deliverables into the system and DoA
Part A and will be placed in an automatically generated work package called ethics
requirements. If the review shows that there are serious ethics issues that cannot be solved,
funding may have to be refused.
You may be asked to provide additional information if this is needed to complete the ethics
review (e.g. in case of serious or complex ethics issues or missing information).
Links
• How to complete your ethics self-assessment
Security scrutiny
In order to ensure that classified information (for EU classified information (EUCI), see Decision
2015/444) is protected from unauthorised disclosure and that security issues emerging from
project activities are appropriately addressed, some EU programmes systematically provide for
a security review procedure for applications that operate in security relevant contexts (e.g.
European Defence Fund, Horizon Europe, Digital Europe).
The details and the scope of the security review depend on each programme. Some
programmes, such as Horizon Europe and Digital Europe, have a more elaborated security
review procedure which includes several steps depending on whether the topic under which a
proposal is submitted is flagged by the Commission as security sensitive or not (see Horizon
Europe Programme Guide).
43EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
The security scrutiny (which is the final step of the more elaborated security review) is
essentially the same for all programmes: proposals must be cleared by the Security Scrutiny
Group (composed of national security experts nominated in agreement with their national
security authorities (NSAs)). The Security Scrutiny Group will determine the level of sensitivity
of the application and check whether all security aspects are being handled appropriately. You
will be informed about the result through your coordinator.
If the security scrutiny leads to requirements to be implemented before grant signature, you
will need to take immediate action to comply. If the scrutiny leads to classification and additional
requirements to be fulfilled during the project, this will be automatically reflected in the system
(classification of existing deliverables, limited dissemination of existing deliverables due to
security reasons, security aspect letter (SAL), security classification guide (SCG), appointment
of project security officer, establishment of security advisory board, etc.). If the scrutiny shows
that the project is too security sensitive, funding may have to be refused.
Links
• How to handle security-sensitive projects
Third country control
Some programmes (or calls) limit the participation of entities which are controlled by third
countries (e.g. European Defence Fund, Digital Europe, Horizon Europe, CEF). In this case, a
special procedure is needed to verify ownership control of participants.

3.2.4 Grant preparation
Grant preparation
The Grant Agreement must be prepared directly in the Portal Grant Management System.
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Grant agreement data
preparation.
Who? The Grant Agreement data should be prepared by the consortium participants together
and submitted by the Coordinator.
How? You will be prompted by e-mail for all the actions that you need to carry out for the grant
preparation. For more details, see the list of grant-related notifications.
What? The grant preparation process consists of:
• setting up the Portal Grant Management System with the:
participants’ legal, administrative and financial information
o
description of the action (DoA, Annex 1 GA)
o
estimated budget (Annex 2 and 2a GA)
o
project variables (when the project starts, reporting periods, amount of
o
prefinancing, GA options, etc)
44EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
legal documents needed for grant signature (declarations of honour)
o
• so that the system can generate the Grant Agreement
and
• trigger signature directly inside the system (Grant Agreement and Accession Forms).
In parallel, the Granting Authority will perform the remaining legal checks to ensure that all the
successful proposals can receive EU funding (legal entity validation, financial capacity check,
non-exclusion check, etc).
Our Grant Agreement clauses are common to all EU programmes and mandatory for all
beneficiaries. They are explained in more detail in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
Grant preparation process
Enter & submit grant data: Entering legal, administrative & financial data > Preparing the
Description of the Action (DoA)
Signing the Grant Agreement
Description of the Action (DoA) (Part A and B)
The description of the action (DoA, Annex 1) is structured like the application form into
two parts, Parts A and B:
• Part A: contains the structured tables with project information (retrieved from the Grant
Management System tabs)
• Part B (the narrative part): is based on Part B of the application form and must be
uploaded as a PDF.
Creating Part B of the DoA is straightforward, as it can be derived directly from Part B of the
application. The instructions for this are available on Portal Reference Documents.
The system will merge the Parts A and B, generating a single PDF with the full description of
the action (DoA).
All participants can contribute to the parts, but it is the Coordinator who will have to finalise
and submit it.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Workplan tables: Complete the workplan tables in Part A, (work package descriptions,
deliverables and milestones)
• Check that all PICs have been validated by the Central Validation Service
• Quality check:
Check that the DoA is coherent and that information in Part A and B is consistent.
Some programmes will ask you not to simply attach the application, but to adapt Part
B. In this case, try to avoid overlaps between Parts A and B (delete work plan tables
from Part B, etc).
Check that DoA and the application match: please check if the content of the DoA differs
from the application, as this must be in compliance with your invitation letter to start
grant preparation. In addition, you may correct shortcomings identified by the experts
in the evaluation summary report. The information presented in the DoA can be made
45EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
more consistent if necessary. Any errors should be corrected (data displayed in a table
or figure is at odds with the description, etc).
Check that the DoA and the legal and administrative information match: for example, it
must describe the role and tasks performed by each Partner (Coordinator, Beneficiary,
Affiliated Entity, Third party providing in-kind contributions, etc) defined in the
structured part.
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed and no
annexes are missing.
Termination of grant preparation
If the consortium decides against the grant during grant preparation, they can launch the
termination process directly in the Portal. See the detailed screens and descriptions in the
on grant preparation termination.
This type of termination works only during grant preparation. Afterwards (after grant
signature), the grant must be formally terminated by amending the GA (early termination
amendment).

3.2.4.1 Enter & submit grant data
Actions to be completed before grant preparation
Organise access rights and roles
All Beneficiaries need access rights in order to prepare their grant data in the system and
sign the legal documents (declarations of honour, Grant Agreements and Accession Forms).
The contact persons of each organisation indicated in the proposal will automatically receive
access rights during grant preparation:
Proposal Grant preparation
Person who created the application ou PCoCo
submit the proposal?
Contact persons with full access rights CoCos (for Coordinator) + PaCos (for
other Beneficiaries)
46EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Contact persons with read-only rights Team Members (TeMes)
In addition, if your organisation has already been validated, the LEAR will normally also
already have been appointed.
Other persons and roles (especially LSIGNs and FSIGNs) will have to be appointed first by
the LEAR (My Organisations > Actions > Edit Organisation Roles > Add Roles) and then
assigned to the project by the CoCos and PaCos (My Projects > Actions > Project
Consortium > Edit Roles).
The minimum setup of roles that you need to prepare and conclude the Grant Agreement
are the following:
• for the Coordinator:
Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo) — already appointed
o
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
o
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN)
o
• for other Beneficiaries:
Participant Contact (PaCo)
o
Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)
o
Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN).
o
The same person can fulfil several or all of the above roles.
Our system allows for only one signature on your side. If your internal rules require
several signatories, you must give an internal mandate to one of them and ensure that the
electronic signature in our system is executed only after all the necessary internal
authorisations were given. These authorisations must be collected, stored and kept by you
in line with your usual management practices (usually paper-based) so that they can be
provided to us in case of EU controls, checks or audits.
More details about nomination are in the Roles and access rights section.
Make sure all participants are registered and validated (PIC)
All Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities must be registered and validated in time for grant
signature (see section on Registration and validation of your organisation).
Associated Partners need to be only registered (have a PIC); no validation is needed,
because they will not receive any grant money.
Prepare and sign a consortium agreement (always recommended; in many
cases mandatory)
Consortium agreements are mandatory for many EU programmes. But even if they are not,
it is highly recommended to have arrangements in place to cover consortium-internal issues
that may arise during the project (e.g. decision-making procedures, resolve conflicts,
safeguard intellectual property rights, etc). The consortium agreement should be signed
before the Grant Agreement. For details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 7
and the How to establish your H2020 consortium agreement.
47EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Enter legal, administrative & financial data
You need to prepare the Grant Agreement in the Portal Grant Management System.
Details are explained in the .
Enter the structured information into the system (Part A of the DoA)
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation
> Grant agreement data preparation and transfer the information from your application
form (Part B) to the Work Packages, Deliverables, Milestones and Critical Risks screens.
You can move work packages up and down by drag & drop to position them in the order of
your preference. When a work package is moved to a new position, the numbering of WPs
(and also the relative numbering of deliverables) is automatically adapted.
Enter the other grant data into the system
a) Set the project starting date
Set the date on which the project is to start (starting date of the action) on the Project
Summary screen.
The options may vary depending on programme and type of action (see call conditions),
but generally there are 2 options:
• the first day of the month after entry into force (signature by EU) — default
option
• if needed, a fixed starting date may be agreed — this should be the first day of
a month and normally after grant signature (unless authorised otherwise by the
Granting Authority).
If you enter a fixed starting date, you will be asked to justify your choice. If you
chose a starting date before grant signature, you must explain why your project requires
this. Please note that the starting date can normally NOT be before the date on which
your application was submitted (unless explicitly allowed in the call conditions). Please
also note that any project activities taking place before grant signature bear the risk
that the grant may finally not be signed.
b) Check the project reporting periods
The reporting periods will be pre-filled for each call on the Reporting Periods screen.
To minimise administrative burden for you, we will choose the smallest possible number
of reporting periods. On average, most programmes tend to have reporting periods
between 12 and 18 months.
c) Check the prefinancing for the project
The standard prefinancing percentage will be pre-filled for each call on the Project
Financial Information screen.
The final prefinancing amount for each project will however be fixed only later, once the
budgetary information is completed from your side and the Granting Authority has
examined the results from the financial capacity assessment (see section Financial
capacity assessment). The prefinancing may be lowered in case of low financial capacity.
48EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
d) Complete the legal and administrative information for the participants
Fill in the missing information for each participant on the Partner Summary screen and
complete the Affiliated Entities and Associated Partner screens.
e) Define the budgets for the participants
Fill in the budget for each participant on the Partner Financial Information screens.
Make sure the budget details match the proposal and the GAP invitation letter (and the
detailed budget table, if required).
f) Provide the banking details for the Coordinator
Select the bank account to be used for payments from the dropdown menu on the
Coordinator’s Bank Account screen.
If your preferred bank account is not listed, you must ask your LEAR to add the bank
account in the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).
Once the new bank account has been validated (this may take a few days), it will appear
in the dropdown menu and you will be able to select it.
f) Enter other information as prompted
Upload Part B of the description of the action (DoA)
Upload Part B on the Documents screen. Follow the instructions from Portal Reference
Documents.
Sign the declarations of honour (DoH)
For each Beneficiary, the PLSIGN must sign a declaration of honour (DoH) directly in the
system (grant declaration) .
Affiliated entities also need to sign a DoH. For them, the responsible Beneficiary must
download the template from Portal Reference Documents, ask each entity to complete and
sign it, then upload the scanned DoHs for their linked third parties.
Joint and several liability of Affiliated Entities (if required)
If the Granting Authority requires joint and several liability of an Affiliated Entity, the
declaration on joint and several liability must be submitted together with the Accession
Form.
The Beneficiary must download the form prepared by the system, ask the Affiliated Entity
to sign it and upload the scanned declaration when signing the Accession Form.
For more details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 22.
Prefinancing guarantee (if required)
If the Granting Authority requires a prefinancing guarantee, you need to obtain this from
a bank or approved financial institution (using the template available on Portal Reference
Documents), send a scanned copy through Portal Formal Notifications (My Projects >
Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) and
the original by registered post with proof of delivery to the mail address of the service
responsible for your grant.
49EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
For more details, see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 23.
Submit grant preparation to the Granting Authority
Assessment by the Granting Authority and finalisation of GA data
The Project Officer will enter the EU grant preparation data (GA options, etc) and check the
data submitted by the consortium. If needed, they will send back the session to the
consortium for changes/addition information (ping-pong).
Tips
Changes to consortium composition/project during grant preparation
Please note that consortia/projects can be altered ONLY under exceptional circumstances,
and ONLY if duly justified.
Nonetheless, there may be circumstances where you may need to change/adjust the consortium
composition/project before grant signature (bankruptcy, merger/acquisition, loss of a key
member of staff that is needed to carry out the project, etc).
In this case, your Coordinator should contact the EU Project Officer explain why and propose a
solution (reassign tasks and budget within the consortium or to a new participant, adjustments
to the project, etc).
If accepted, you may need to update the Grant Management System screens and upload a new
Part B.
Please note that the proposals may NOT be substantially changed and that all changed
elements must comply with the call conditions for the call. Redistribution of tasks must be in
line with the competences of the participants concerned and the quality of the
project/consortium must be guaranteed.
If no acceptable solution is presented, we will request you to withdraw the proposal and
terminate grant preparation.
Deadlines
In the interest of all sides, we will try to handle grant preparation as swiftly as possible (ideally
3 months after you receive the GAP invitation letter).
To make this happen, we will ask you to comply with relatively strict deadlines during grant
preparation:
• Preparation grant data & annexes (first version): 3 weeks after GAP invitation letter
• Finalisation grant data & annexes: up to 2 weeks after reply by Project Officer
• Sign declaration of honour (DoH): at the latest 6 weeks after GAP invitation letter.
• Grant signature: 3 months from GAP invitation letter
Deadlines can be extended under exceptional circumstances by the EU Project Officer.
Please note that if you have not been granted an extension, and fail to meet the established
deadlines, preparation of your Grant Agreement may be terminated and your proposal rejected.
3.2.4.2 Final legal checks
50EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
During grant preparation, we will also finalise the mandatory legal checks (legal entity
validation, operational and financial capacity, exclusion and double funding).
In case of issues, we may need to contact you.
3.2.5 Grant signature
Signing the Grant Agreement is the last step of the grant preparation phase. It is done directly
in the Portal Grant Management System (electronic signature) and demonstrates that both
contracting parties formally approve the agreement and its annexes.
The Grant Agreement enters into force with the last signature (normally the EU because the
Coordinator usually signs first).
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Sign.
Who? The Grant Agreement is signed by the EU and the Coordinator. The other Beneficiaries
do not sign the Grant Agreement itself, but accede to the Grant Agreement through Accession
Forms. Affiliated Entities or Associated Partners do not sign and do not become formal parties
to the Agreement.
How? You will receive e-mail notifications prompting the tasks needed for grant signature. For
more detail, see the list of grant-related notifications.
Signing EU Grant Agreements electronically —
What's involved?
The electronic signature in the Portal requires:
• a chain of trust with Beneficiaries — to guarantee signatories' identity
• a system of digital signatures protected by multiple security features — to guarantee
documents' reliability and authenticity
This type of electronic signature is used for signature of contracts, amendments and cost claims
(Financial Statements and invoices).
The chain of trust
LEAR
The Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR) appointed by the Beneficiary’s legal
representative (signed LEAR documents uploaded in the Participant Register) is the
centrepiece of the chain of trust. More in the section LEAR appointment and validation.
LEAR appoints all LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation
The LEAR vouches for the organisation data entered into the system and the nominated
persons. They appoint the individuals authorised to sign:
51EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Grant Agreements and amendments (Legal Signatories, known as LSIGNs)
• Financial Statements (Financial Signatories, known as FSIGNs).
The LEAR is responsible for keeping these lists constantly updated.
PaCO selects LSIGN and FSIGN for project
Participant Contacts (PaCo) or Coordinator Contacts (CoCos) have to select the Project
Legal Signatories (PLSIGNs) and Financial Signatories (PFSIGNs) from the LSIGN and
FSIGN lists nominated by the LEAR. For more information, check the section on Roles and
access rights.
Closed system where access rights are strictly controlled.
The chain of trust is built in a closed electronic exchange system. Each individual must
identify themselves with their personal EU Login account and access is strictly controlled.
Signing the Grant Agreement
Sign the declarations of honour (DoH)
Before the Grant Agreement can be signed, the PLSIGN of each Beneficiary must sign a
declaration of honour (grant declaration). For more details, see Enter legal administrative
& financial grant data.
Grant agreement ready for signature
The system prepares the Grant Agreement for signing (PDF document, digitally sealed to
guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).
Coordinator signs the Grant Agreement
The Coordinator's PLSIGN logs into the Portal My Projects > Actions > Manage Project >
Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Sign.
52EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
During signature, a pop-up explains that this means the signatory is preparing to sign. It
then asks the PLSIGN to confirm that they wish to sign and a second prompt asks the
PLSIGN to enter their EU Login password.
After signature, the system creates a new version of the PDF document (with a digital seal,
a time stamp, and the signatory's EU Login credentials on the signature placeholder). The
validity of the signature can be verified by opening it in a compatible PDF reader and clicking
on the image of the digital signature.
The Grant Agreement can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature)
from the Documents screen if desired.
The LEAR of the Coordinator and the other Beneficiaries are informed that the Coordinator
has signed the Grant Agreement.
Granting authority signs the Grant Agreement
The EU Authorising Officer is prompted to countersign the Grant Agreement from their side
(same procedure as under point 3).
The Participants will be informed and the countersigned Grant Agreement will be available
in their Portal Library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Document Library).
Participants sign the Accession forms
All other Beneficiaries' PLSIGNs are prompted to sign their Accession Forms (same
procedure as under point 3) — within 30 days after entry into force (signature by EU).
The CoCos and LEAR of the Coordinator and PaCo and LEAR of the concerned Beneficiary
are notified when an Accession Form has been signed.
Grant Agreement is finalised
Not signed Grant Agreement
• If the Coordinator does not sign, the Granting Authority may stop preparing the grant
and reject the proposal.
• If a Beneficiary does not sign the Accession Form within 30 days of the Grant Agreement
entering into force, the Granting Authority may terminate the Grant Agreement. In this
case, in order to continue with the project, the Coordinator must: request an
amendment, so that any changes needed to ensure that the project is carried out
properly can be made.
This request must be made within 30 days after the missed deadline for signing
o
the Accession Form.
The request for an amendment does not affect the Granting Authority's right to
o
terminate the Grant Agreement.
The Accession Form template is available for information on Portal Reference
Documents.
Project starting date
The project starting date is calculated as from the entry into force of the Grant Agreement (last
signature = signature by the EU).
53EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Prefinancing
The entry into force and starting date also determine the baseline date for the prefinancing (i.e.
the float that we normally pay immediately after grant signature).
Depending on the programme (see call conditions), prefinancing is either paid 30 days from:
• Horizon Europe, Digital, SMP, etc: the entry into force or 10 days before the starting
date or submission of the prefinancing guarantee (if required) — depending on which
is the latest
or
• CEF, LIFE, EMFAF, Erasmus, etc: the entry into force or submission of the prefinancing
guarantee (if required) — depending on which is the latest.

3.2.6 Complaints about proposal rejection
If you believe that the rejection of your proposal was based on an error in the selection
procedure, you can submit a complaint (following the deadlines and procedures set out in the
evaluation result letter).
Generally, the means of redress are the following:
• request for admissibility/eligibility or evaluation review (redress review) — within 30
days of receiving the letter
• for decisions by EU executive agencies: request for review of legality under Article 22
of Regulation 58/2003 — within 1 month of receiving the letter (using the Article 22
complaints form template)
• action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU — within 2 months of receiving the letter.
You are free to choose any of the above means of redress. However, in the interest of good
administration and procedural efficiency, it is recommended to use first the available
administrative review procedures (if any). The objective of these procedures is to re-examine
the circumstances of the selection procedure and to reach a final decision on your application.
Deadlines for further redress will therefore run as from when you receive our reply with the
final position.
Please note that notifications which have not been opened within 10 days after sending are
considered to have been accessed and that the deadlines will be counted from opening/access
(see Portal Terms and Conditions).
Complaints will be subject to the following conditions:
• Complaints must focus on aspects concerning the evaluation of the proposals (e.g.
admissibility or eligibility checks, evaluation procedure, etc), not their merits. Thus,
applicants can raise procedural irregularities, factual errors, manifest errors of
assessment or abuse of powers (e.g. lack of coherence between scores and comments,
lack or inadequate reasoning of the conclusions, the existence of a conflict of interests,
exceeding the limits of discretion, etc). Mere repetitions of the content of the proposal
or disagreements with the result or reasoning of the technical evaluation will not be
considered.
54EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Only one request for review per proposal will be considered. The request cannot refer
to the evaluation of proposals submitted by other applicants or under different or
previous calls.
• Review requests will not always necessarily also lead to a re-evaluation of your proposal
(new technical evaluation with new group of evaluators). The administrative review
procedure will re-examine your case, but a re-evaluation will be decided only if your
complaint demonstrates that the procedural irregularity, factual error, manifest error of
assessment or abuse of powers affects the decision on whether to fund the proposal.
Thus, for example, a problem relating to one of the evaluation criteria will not lead to a
re-evaluation if, even by adding the maximum points under this criterion, the final score
of the proposal would still remain below the threshold for funding.
• Re-evaluations will be made on the proposal as it was originally submitted; no additional
information will be admitted. Re-evaluations will be partial (limited to the criterion
affected by the error) or full (when the whole evaluation has been recognized as flawed)
— depending on the case. They may be assigned to the same evaluation panel or a new
one, depending on the internal procedures of the Granting Authority.
• The score following a re-evaluation may be lower than the original score.
• All requests for review will be treated as confidential.
Please pay attention to who took the formal decision and who the complaint must be addressed
to. If a decision was taken by an EU executive agency or other EU body, both redress review
and applications for annulment must be directed against that agency/body (NOT against the
European Commission). Only Article 22 complaints must be addressed to the respective
Directorate-General of the Commission (parent DG of the executive agency).
In case you consider that there has been maladministration on our part, you can also address
a complaint to the European Ombudsman — within 2 years after you became aware of it AND
after having used all the means of administrative redress available (redress and Article 22
request, if any).
3.3 Grant management
3.3.1 Keeping records
All participants must keep records and other supporting documentation in order to prove
the proper implementation and the costs claimed (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art
20).
For Lump Sum grants, records on costs incurred are exceptionally NOT needed; it is enough to
keep the evidence to prove the proper implementation of the action.

3.3.2 Amendments
Amendments requested by the consortium
55EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If there are any changes to the Grant Agreement (e.g. data or options specific to that
agreement) or its annexes, they must be done through a formal amendment directly in the
Portal (electronic signature).
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Request for Amendment.
Who? Amendments can be prepared by the consortium participants together, but only the
Coordinator can launch, sign and submit them.
The EU Granting Authority can also propose amendments, but for practical reasons we will often
as you to initiate the procedure.
When? Amendments must normally be done before the end of the project, but some
amendment clauses are also open afterwards (addition of Beneficiary/Affiliated
Entity/Associated Partner, change of Coordinator, change of Annex 1, change of Annex 2,
change of bank account, error amendments, etc).
What? Cases requiring a formal amendment are listed in the AGA — Annotated Grant
Agreement, art 39. See also How to prepare an amendment in the .
Amendments are normally NOT necessary for:
• budget transfers covered by the budget flexibility
• name or address changes of a participant — done directly in the Participant Register
• universal takeovers (merger/acquisition) of a participant — done directly in the
Participant Register
• changes of the banking details — done directly in the Participant Register.
The signed amendment is the legal document containing the changes to the Grant
Agreement. It is legally binding and will be incorporated into the Agreement. The consolidated
version is only for information.
Amendment process
Get ready > Launch amendment > Amendment preparation > Consult Commission >
Sign&Submit > Assessment > Countersign
Amendment request
The amendment request consists of:
• updated structured information on the Grant Management System screens
• amendment request letter: the letter with the request and reasons for the amendment
• amendment core (including new version of GA Annexes 1 and 2, if needed): the legal
document with the list of amendment clauses
• supporting documents: documents uploaded by the consortium, consolidated Grant
Agreement, etc
All participants can contribute to the amendment, but it is the Coordinator who will have to
launch, finalise, submit and sign the request.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
56EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Check that the updated information Grant Management System screens is correct.
• Quality check: Check that the Amendment documents are correct and all supporting
documents attached.
Actions to be completed before amendment
Make sure new participants are registered and validated (PIC)
New Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities must be registered and validated in the Participant
Register before the amendment can be requested (see section on Registration and
validation of your organisation).
Associated Partners need to be only registered (have a PIC); no validation is needed,
because they will not receive any grant money from us.
Make sure that new bank accounts are registered and validated
New banking information must be registered and validated in the Participant Register
before an amendment can be requested (see section on Bank account registration and
validation).
Submitting an amendment
Amendments must be prepared in the Portal Grant Management System.
Details are explained in the .
Get ready
Before launching your amendment request, prepare the supporting documents and, if
needed, discuss the request beforehand with the EU Project Officer (— recommended for
more complicated cases).
Launch the amendment
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU >
Request for Amendment
Amendment reference number (ID) — Once you have launched the request, the
amendment is automatically assigned a reference number. Please use this unique identifier
in all contacts with the Granting Authority during the amendment process.
Change the grant data in the system
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Amendment > Amendment preparation.
Once the amendment is been launched, you can amend the grant data in the same way as
as you did when preparing the Grant Agreement.
Enter the amendment information into the system
a) Justification
57EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Fill out the field to justify the request on the Amendment Information screen.
b) Amendment clauses
On the basis of the changes to the grant data, the system will automatically select the
relevant amendment types (automatic clauses) on the Amendment Information screen.
Other types of amendment have to be selected manually by the EU Project Officer,
(change of Annex 1, change in the maximum grant amount, resuming the action after
suspension, etc). Contact the Project Officer to activate the clause.
In case a change triggers the need for another change, a prompt will appear.
Upload annexes and supporting documents
You will be prompted to upload mandatory supporting documents. These depend on the
type of amendment and the specific case (e.g. a new Beneficiary must provide the DoH
and the Accession Form).
Consult Granting Authority
Once ready, the amendment request must be submitted to the Granting Authority for
informal assessment.
Informal assessment by the Granting Authority
The Project Officer will check that the amendment request is correct and admissible. If
needed, they will send it back to the consortium for changes/additional information (ping-
pong).
Coordinator signs & submits the amendment request
Once the request for an amendment is complete and ready to be submitted, the system
generates the 2 documents (amendment request letter and amendment core) for signature
(PDF document, digitally signed to guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).
The Coordinator’s PLSIGN logs into My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Amendment
> Sign & Submit (same procedure as for Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant
Agreement).
The amendment can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature) from
the Documents screen if desired.
As Coordinator, you cannot alter a request for an amendment once it has been signed
and submitted. There are 2 options:
• You withdraw it.
• The Granting Authority rejects it (amendment rejection letter).
Formal assessment by the Granting Authority
The Granting Authority has 45 days to accept or reject the request.
This deadline will be extended if needed (e.g. if the amendment are complex, specific
compliance checks are needed for a new participant, or if the project has to be reviewed to
assess the changes).
58EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Granting authority signs the amendment
Acceptance: If the Granting Authority accepts the request, they countersign it from their
side (same procedure as for Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant Agreement).
The Coordinator and Beneficiaries will be informed and the countersigned amendment will
be available in their Portal Library (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Project
Library).
Rejection: If the request is rejected, the consortium will be informed by amendment
rejection letter.
Amendment number — Once the amendment is countersigned, it is automatically assigned
a sequential amendment number (1, 2, 3, etc). For instance, an amendment request with
the reference AMD-345622-6 is assigned number 2 if it is the 2nd signed amendment for
the grant. Rejected amendments are assigned a number (R1, R2); but they are saved, so
that they can be reused to draw up a new request.
The Coordinator’s PLSIGN can withdraw a submitted request until it is countersigned.
Withdrawn requests are saved and can be reused to submit a new request.
Entry into force & taking effect
An amendment proposed by a consortium enters into force on the day the Granting Authority
signs it.
It takes effect (i.e. the changes to the Grant Agreement start to apply) either:
• on a specific date specified in the amendment or
• on the date of entry into force (last signature = signature by the EU).
Depending on the nature of the amendment, the date on which it takes effect may affect
the eligibility of costs (e.g. if a Beneficiary is added, costs are eligible from the accession date
specified in the Accession Form).
Coordinator change without their agreement
If the Coordinator is to be replaced without their agreement, another Beneficiary (acting on
behalf of the other Beneficiaries in the consortium) must submit the amendment request.
To do this, you will need to contact the EU Project Officer, so that they can give you
(exceptional) PCoCo access rights in the system.
Please note you will have to provide proof both of the consortium decision to change the
Coordinator, to nominate you to act on their behalf AND the opinion of the changed Coordinator
(or at least proof that the opinion was requested) — otherwise the termination will be considered
improper.
Amendments initiated by the Granting Authority
If the Granting Authority requests an amendment, the request is also prepared and signed
electronically in the Portal Grant Management System.
You will receive an e-mail notification prompting you to accept the request.
To do so, the Coordinator's PLSIGN must countersign the amendment on the consortium's
behalf.

3.3.3 Continuous reporting on milestones & deliverables
During the project, you are expected to provide regular updates on the status of the project:
the continuous reporting.
The continuous reporting includes:
• progress in achieving milestones
• deliverables
• updates to the publishable summary
• response to critical risks, publications, communications activities, IPRs
• programme-specific monitoring information (if required).
Where? The Continuous Reporting Module is accessible through the link you receive at the
beginning of the project.
Who? Milestones and deliverables should be submitted by each participant for their work.
What? You should report on milestones and deliverables in accordance with the schedule set
out for them.
The Continuous Reporting Module also allows you to report on critical risks, prepare the
summary for publication and the programme-specific information on indicators (e.g. Trainings,
Gender, Open Data, etc — if available for your programme and type of action).
Milestones — Control points in the project that help to chart progress (kick-off meetings,
steering committes, first-draft of a survey, prototype, etc). They may correspond to the
completion of a key deliverable, which allows the next phase of the work to begin or is needed
at intermediary points.
Deliverables — Outputs to be submitted to the EU (publication, leaflet, progress report,
brochure, list, etc).
All this information is automatically compiled to create part A of the periodic Technical Report,
at the moment this report is prepared (Locked for review).
Reporting in the Continuous Reporting Module
At the beginning of the project, you will receive a notification (+ link) that the Continuous
Reporting Module is activated and that you can contribute to it on an ongoing basis.
Detailed information on the Module can be found in the .
Update the project summary
60EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Please note that you must provide a separate summary for each periodic report (just
update the summary for the previous period).
The summary must be suitable for direct publication by the Granting Authority,
especially:
• be a stand-alone text — no references to other parts of the report, only to publicly
available information.
• easily understandable by a general audience
• preferably not longer than 7,480 characters (roughly 2 pages)
• with no confidential/sensitive data
You can upload diagrams or photographs illustrating and promoting your project work (
only as images and you must have cleared any rights of third parties advance).
You can also mention the websites used to promote the EU project (see section
Communicating and promoting the project).
Update the deliverables
The deliverables must be submitted according to the timing specified in the Continuous
Reporting section.
At the time the periodic report is submitted, check if all deliverables due have been
provided and, if not, give an explanation in the Comments column (especially for missing
or late deliverables and/or cancelled or grouped deliverables).
Update the milestones
Specify whether the milestones were achieved or not. If not, enter an estimate of when.
The milestones table included in each periodic report is cumulative (it shows all milestones
from the beginning of the project).
Update the critical risks
Assess the state of play of the listed risks and if necessary specify new mitigation
measures or add newly identified risks.
Programme-specific monitoring information (if required)
Some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) have additional policy-monitoring screens on
indicators which require input (Publications, Dissemination, Patents (IPR), SME
participation, Gender, Infrastructure, Innovation, Open data, ABS Regulation, Trainings).

3.3.4 Reports & payment requests
61EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
In order to receive payments, the consortium must submit periodic reports (following the
schedule set out in the Grant Agreement). When these are due, they must be submitted directly
in the Periodic Reporting Module of the Portal Grant Management System.
Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions
> Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Technical Part contribution/Financial Statement
drafting.
Who? The periodic report should be prepared by the consortium participants together and
submitted by the Coordinator.
How? You will be prompted by e-mail for all the actions that you need to carry out for the
periodic reporting.
What? In the periodic report, you should report on the progress of the work and costs claimed
(see below Periodic Report). When the Coordinator submits the periodic report, the IT tool will
capture the information from the Continuous Reporting Module in order to generate the Part A
of the Technical Report. The system will also consolidate the Individual Financial Statements
and it will generate the use of resources report (if required) and the Summary Financial
Statements (for the consortium).
Reporting process
Continuous reporting > Preparing your periodic report > Approving Partners' reports >
Submitting the report to the Commission > Acceptance or rejection by the Commission >
Interim payment
Periodic report: Technical Report (Part A and B) and Financial Report
The periodic report consists of two parts, the Technical Report and Financial Report.
The Technical Report is itself also divided in two parts, Parts A and B:
Part A: contains the structured tables with project information (retrieved from the Grant
Management System).
Part B (the narrative part): mirrors the application form and requires the participants to report
on differences (delays, work not implemented, new subcontracts, budget overruns etc). It must
be uploaded as PDF document.
The Financial Report consists of the structured individual and consolidated Financial
Statements (retrieved from the Grant Management System). In addition, most programmes
require either a detailed cost reporting table (excel table) or the use of resources report (online
wizard) and, for payments above a certain thresholds, a certificate on the financial statements
(CFS).
The technical report Part A and the financial report is generated automatically on the basis of
the data in the Grant Management System; Part B needs to be prepared outside the tools (using
62EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
the template downloaded from the system) and then uploaded as PDF (together with Annexes,
if any).
All participants should contribute to the parts, but it is the Coordinator who will have to submit
them as a single report.
Tasks of the Coordinator:
• Check that the Continuous Reporting Module is updated in time (before the Periodic
Report is Locked for review).
• Check that all participants have submitted their Financial Statements (and CFS, if
needed)
• Quality checks:
Check that the Report is coherent and that information in Part A and B is consistent.
Make sure that the template has been followed and all sections are completed and no
annexes are missing.
Certificate on the Financial Statements (CFS)
The CFS is a report produced by an independent auditor (or, for public bodies, public officer)
using the template available on Portal Reference Documents. Its purpose is to give assurance
to the Granting Authority about the regularity of the costs claimed.
The thresholds depend on the EU programme and type of action (see call conditions on the
Topic page). For the MFF 2021-2027, there is usually a single threshold of EUR 325 000
requested EU contribution.
Please note that costs already audited by the Granting Authority do not have to be covered
again by the CFS (the EU contribution covered by the audit can therefore be excluded from the
calculation of the threshold).
The CFS must be uploaded as a scanned copy (PDF) together with the Financial Statement. The
originals must be kept in the your files.
Submitting the periodic reports
You should start preparing the periodic report in the Grant Management System right after the
periodic reporting is opened at the end of each reporting period (— deadline for submission is
normally 60 days).
Details on how to submit are available in the .
Make sure that the information in the Continuous Reporting Module is updated
This must be done before the Technical Report (both parts) is first Locked for review by
the Coordinator. Any entries into the Continuous Reporting Module made afterwards will
NOT be included in this periodic report.
Complete your Financial Statements
63EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Go to My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Financial Statement
drafting and complete the Financial Statements for each participant on their Financial
Statement screen.
Make sure the cost details match the use of resources or detailed budget table (if required).
To sign and submit to the Coordinator, the Beneficiary’s PFSIGN must log into My Projects
> Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Sign & Submit (same procedure as for
Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant Agreement).
Affiliated Entities must supply their Beneficiary with a signed paper Financial Statement;
the Beneficiary must then fill in the information in the system and sign and submit.
If you fail to submit a Financial Statement, your costs will be considered zero for this
reporting period (but you can declare them in the next reporting period).
Upload Part B of the technical report
Upload Part B on the Technical Report Part B screen (as a single PDF). Use the template
available inside the system. This can be done by any Beneficiary (not only the Coordinator).
If any changes to Part B are needed, you must delete the pdf file and upload a new one.
When both Parts A and B are ready to submit, the Technical Report can be finalised by the
Coordinator (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Accept &
Include).
Coordinator approves Partners' financial reports
The Coordinator must review and explicitly approve the periodic report. If needed, you can
send back a Financial Statement to a Partner for further changes, or unlock the Technical
Report for editing.
Before submitting, all the accepted Partners' Financial Statements must be included (My
Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Include).
Missing statements
Sometimes you may decide to submit the report without Financial Statements from certain
Partners (e.g. if a Beneficiary cannot submit its individual Financial Statement on time). If
this happens, you will be asked to confirm that you are aware of this and that therefore
these costs will not be considered for the current payment. The participant's costs will be
considered zero for this reporting period, but they will be able to declare their costs in the
next financial report (next reporting period).
Submit the report to the Granting Authority
The Coordinator must submit all parts of the periodc report together (all the individual
Financial Statements and Part B of the Technical Report): My Projects > Actions > Manage
Project > Periodic Reporting > Submit to EU. The system will automatically generate the
report with explanations of the use of resources and the periodic Summary Financial
Statements, which includes the request for payment.
Acceptance or rejection by the Granting Authority
The Granting Authority will either:
• accept the report and start preparing the payment or
64EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• ask for changes to it — which means that the process described above starts
again.
Payment
When the Granting Authority approves the payment, the amount due will be paid out to
the Coordinator (within 90 days of receiving the report)
If the amount due is above the interim payment ceiling (90% of the maximum grant
amount), the amount due will be lowered.
The Granting Authority will send a letter to inform about the payment. After receiving the
letter, the Coordinator has 30 days to submit observations, if needed. In case of
observations, the Granting Authority will send a confirmation letter to state its final
position.
Final report
The Periodic Reporting Module (and periodic reports) are also used for the final report (report
for the last reporting period, to close the grant). The system behaviour, screens and documents
used are the same.
Beneficiary termination reporting
If one of the Beneficiaries has to leave the consortium, the the Coordinator has to prepare a
termination report (Technical Report Part B and Financial Report) and a report on the
distribution of payments to this Beneficiary in the Grant Management System.
Details on the steps to follow are explained in the .

3.3.5 Communicating your project — Acknowledgement of EU
funding
Since the EU grants are financed by public funds, EU Beneficiaries are generally expected to
actively engage in communication activities, to promote the projects and to publicly
acknowledge the EU support.
Communicating and promoting the project
65EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
What does communication involve?
The communication activities must already be part of the proposal (either as a specific work
package for communication or by including them in another work package). Communication will
be taken into consideration as part of the award criteria.
A good communication plan should define clear objectives (adapted to various relevant
target audiences) and set out a description and timing for each activity.
With your communication activities you should draw the attention (general and specialised
audiences) to the EU policy area addressed by the call.
Regarding typical communication activities (and indicators to measure them), you can refer to
the communication network indicators we use for our own communication activities.
In addition, some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) may have more targeted communication
guidance (see Horizon Europe Programme Guide).
Good communication
• Starts at the outset of the action and continues throughout its entire lifetime
• Is strategically planned and not just ad-hoc efforts
• Identifies and sets clear communication objectives (e.g. have final and intermediate
communication aims been specified? what impact is intended? what reaction or change
is expected from the target audience?)
• Is targeted and adapted to audiences that go beyond the project's own community,
including the media and the public
• Chooses relevant messages (e.g. how does the action's work relate to our everyday
lives? why does the target audience need to know about the action?)
• Uses the right medium and means (e.g. working at the right level — local, regional,
national, EU-wide; using the right ways to communicate — one-way exchange (website,
press release, brochure, etc) or two-way exchange (exhibition, school visit, internet
debate, et.); where relevant, include measures for public/societal engagement on issues
related to the action)
• Is proportionate to the scale of the action.
Acknowledgement of EU funding
Beneficiaries of EU funding must display the EU flag and funding statement (“Funded by the
European Union” or “Co-funded by the European Union”) in all their communication and
dissemination activities and any infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, supplies or major result
results funded by the grant.
The EU flag and funding statement must be displayed in a way that is easily visible for the public
and with sufficient prominence.
EU funding must moreover be acknowledged in all types of public outputs (including patent
applications, EU standardisation of results), media contacts and other public statements.
The EU flag and funding statement are available in the Grant Agreement and on the Europa
website.

• 60-minute workout webinar to increase the communication impact of your project
3.3.6 Dissemination & exploitation of project results
Since EU grants are financed by public funds, EU Beneficiaries moreover also expected to
disseminate their project results. In this way, the projects can benefit a larger group of persons
and reach wider target groups.
Several programmes will therefore ask you to upload results on dedicated results portals
(accessible through the Portal Projects & Results page).
Some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) will require more extensive dissemination and
exploitation activities (e.g. open access, exploitation obligation, etc; see Horizon Europe
Programme Guide).
In case of specific questions on intellectual property, the EU IP Helpdesk may provide support.
Links
• AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 16 and Annex 5
3.3.7 Checks, audits, reviews & investigations
In order to ensure sound financial management and compliance with the Grant Agreement
rules, the Granting Authority will perform project reviews and financial audits on participants.
For lump sum grants, since they do not use actual costs, there will be no financial audits focusing
on costs. Reviews will focus on the technical implementation of the action or other aspects of
the Grant Agreement.
Project reviews
The Granting Authority will regularly monitor the project implementation and check the proper
implementation of the action and compliance with the Grant Agreement obligations, including
assessing deliverables and reports.
In addition, the Granting Authority may also carry out in-depth project reviews. Those reviews
focus typically on the technical implementation of the project, but may also cover financial and
budgetary aspects or compliance with other obligations under the GA.
Audits
In addition, most programmes perform financial audits of participants in EU projects (often with
the help of outside audit firms).
Such audits will be performed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. The
auditors comply with ethical requirements and will plan and perform relevant procedures in line
with the EU Grants Indicative Audit Programme, in order to obtain reasonable assurance that
the Financial Statements are free of material misstatement.
You will receive a draft audit report on which you will be able to provide your observations.
If systemic errors are found, the Granting Authority may extend the findings of the audit
results to non-audited Grant Agreements or non-audited periods.
67EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Anti-fraud strategy — OLAF investigations
In case of fraud suspicions, the Granting Authority will inform the European Anti-fraud Office
(OLAF), who may conduct more in-depth investigations.
OLAF also cooperates with national authorities (through information exchange, on-the-spot
checks, coordination of forensic audits etc).
Related Certifications
Certificate on the methodology for unit cost (CoMUC)
The CoMUC is a factual report produced by an independent auditor (using the template available
on Portal Reference Documents). Its purpose is to enable the granting authority to:
• identify your usual cost accounting practices
• check that you have used a suitable unit cost accounting methodology.
Submitting a CoMUC methodology certificate is voluntary. Doing so will help prevent problems
later on, if your grant is audited. If the certificate is approved, costs declared in line with this
methodology will not be challenged, unless you have concealed information for the purpose of
the approval.
For the MFF 2021-2027, only CEF and Digital Europe will be using this certification. For Horizon
Europe it has been replaced by the SPA (systems and process audit; see AGA — Annotated
Grant Agreement, art 24).
The certificate may be requested at any time during the implementation of the programme.
As a minimum, one project should have been started and the data available must give the
auditor enough of a basis to carry out the necessary procedures. Ideally, we would recommend
submitting the methodology after at least one reporting period has passed.
In case of subsequent changes to your methodology you should notify the Granting Authority.
You may also submit a new certificate reflecting the changes.

Formal notification
The formal notification channel (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new
interaction with the EU > Formal Notification) can be used ONLY for correspondence requiring
acknowledgement of receipt, i.e.
• to dispatch replies to formal notifications received from the Granting Authority
and
• for communications under Article 19 of the Grant Agreement
information requests
o
information about events and circumstances which impact the action and
o
• whenever it is clearly stipulated in the Grant Agreement (e.g. declare conflict of interest,
force majeure).
Portal Messaging Facility
The two Portal Messaging Facilities should be used for all other communications:
• Participant Register: My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation

7. Working as an expert
69EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Introduction
The EU services managing grants and tenders frequently make use of different types of
independent experts to assist them with the implementation, evaluation and monitoring of their
funding programmes. These include:
• Evaluators
• Observers
• Ethics evaluators
• Monitors
• Ethics monitors
• business coaches
As an expert you perform this work as an independent individual and do NOT represent a
company or organisation.
The EU services recruit experts from the Portal Expert Database, where you can register at
any time. Registration is open to experts of any nationality including those outside of the EU
and Associated Countries.
To find out exactly what type of knowledge and skills we are looking for, see call for expression
of interest.
Working as an expert in short:
• Place of work: All or part of the evaluation and monitoring may be carried out at your
home or place of work (remote evaluation), or at the offices of the service concerned
(usually Brussels or Luxembourg), depending on the type of work to be done. Project
review sessions and audits, involving project representatives, may take place either at
the service’s offices or on the Beneficiaries' premises.
• Conflicts of interest: You will NOT be appointed for proposals or projects if you have
a vested interest that could influence the way you evaluate them. For more detail, please
see the section on Contracting and payments and the Model Contract for Experts.
• Confidentiality: If you are going to be handling classified information, you will need
security clearance before you can sign a contract.
• Remuneration: As an expert, you will normally receive EUR 450 for each full day
worked. However for remote evaluation and ethics review, we have developed a new
simplified methodology to calculate the amounts, please see details in the contracting
& payment section. Your travel and subsistence costs will be refunded.
• Amount of work: Projects are usually monitored and evaluated in sessions lasting 15
days a year at most. The number of proposals you assess will largely depend on the
area concerned. An independent expert may normally earn up EUR 90 000 in a four
calendar year period (counting fees only and at the current rate this equals 200 days).

7.1 Expert registration
Registering as an expert
To work as expert, you will first need to register.
To register, go to the Experts' page on the Funding & Tenders Portal. To access the registration
forms, you'll need an EU Login account, which you can set-up on the same website if you don't
yet have one.
Once you've done this, you can log in to your account any time and view, update or complete
your profile in “My Expert Area”.
Click on the "Register as an expert" button. To create your profile, you'll need to specify:
• personal details, knowledge of languages, education and training
• area of expertise
• professional experience (employment, past involvement in EU research programmes,
publications or other achievements...)
To find out exactly what type of knowledge and skills we are looking for, see the call for
expression of interests.
Privacy
Once you have completed all sections and your profile status appears as 'valid', you become
eligible for selection for an assignment. However, registration as an expert in the database
does not guarantee automatic selection. The EU services will select experts according to their
needs of expertise.
If you are selected, you will be contacted directly by the service concerned.
Selection of experts
Experts will be selected for assignments from the database of experts who registered in My
Expert Area.
The experts will be selected for each assignment on the basis of the specific expertise needed.
For each assignment (e.g. evaluation of a call or monitoring of projects), a 'pool' of experts
is drawn-up on the basis of the following criteria:
71EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• Experts have a high level of skills, experience and knowledge in the relevant
area, including project management, innovation, exploitation, dissemination
and communication. Where relevant, inter-disciplinary experts, those with
expertise in appropriate disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, as well as
gender specialists are included in the 'pool'.
• If this condition is satisfied, the 'pool' should have a balanced composition in terms
of various skills, experience and knowledge, geographical diversity and
gender. With respect to gender, the policy of the EU is one of equal opportunities for
women and men and, in this context, we have a target of 40% of the under-represented
sex in evaluation panels and expert groups.
• A private-public sector balance is assured, if appropriate.
• Experts are regularly rotated by ensuring that individual experts do not work more
than 200 days activities within consecutive 4 calendar years (EUR 90 000 EUR). With
respect to evaluations in particular, for each call, at least 25% of experts included in the
'pool' should be newcomers, i.e. not have evaluated for the call in the previous 3 years.
The 'pool' of experts is drawn-up well in advance of the assignment in question and the final
list of experts selected from the initial 'pool' is made once the precise needs in terms of expertise
are known, e.g. in the case of an evaluation, after the call deadline once the proposals are
known. Consequently, extra experts are generally included in the 'pool' to ensure the expertise
required is covered and to foresee a sufficient reserve, should some no longer be in a position
to carry out the task.
7.2 Signing a contract and payment
Contracts
If you are selected as an expert, you will be offered a contract to be signed and managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. This contract (including its annexes) defines all the
rights, obligations, terms and conditions applicable to you. It is not an employment contract or
agreement.
Your contract will be based on the Model Contract for Experts. Some of the terms and conditions
in your contract will vary, depending on the type of expert activity that you are asked to carry
out. The contract will indicate
• whether or not your work will involve travel,
• the maximum number of days of work that you will be paid for and
• the planned calendar for your work.
Your correspondence with the EU services
All your correspondence with us is electronic. You should use only My Expert Area (Funding &
Tenders Portal) to communicate about your contract, e.g.
• submitting your identity/bank account details
• signing your contract (electronic-signature)
• making requests for payment and providing related supporting documents.
For any other correspondence related to your contract that the My Expert Area does not
currently support, use the email address indicated in Article 21.3 of your contract.
72EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Signing the contract
You must sign the contract online in My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal. You will
receive an email notification inviting you to do so, with a link to the contract.
The contract enters into force only once it has been signed by both parties. The contract must
be signed by both yourself and the EU service concerned by the day on which you start working
as an expert. Please do not forget to obtain permission from your employer to carry out your
expert activities if your employer requires this for outside activities – this is your responsibility.
You may start work as soon as the contract has entered into force.
If you have a contract to act as an evaluator or monitor, you will be granted access to the IT
system for the relevant proposals or project reports once the contract has entered into force.
Code of conduct
You need to adhere to the code of conduct in Annex 1 of the model contract, which includes
rules on the performance of the contract and obligations of impartiality and confidentiality.
Please carefully read Annex 1 before signing the contract.
Conflicts of interest
When contracting independent experts, the EU services ensure — to the best of their knowledge
- that you, as an expert, do not have any conflicts of interest on the activity that you are being
asked to undertake and, in particular, any proposal or project you are called upon to assess.
You should be independent, impartial and objective, and behave professionally at all times.
The contract you sign before starting work includes a declaration that you accept and will
abide by the Code of Conduct (Annex 1 of the contract). This means, amongst other things,
that
• you declare that no conflict of interest exists and
• you will inform the EU service concerned if you should discover that any such conflict
arises in the course of your duties.
• If, at the time that you sign the contract, you are already aware that you may be in a
position of conflict of interest, you are required to declare this.
Conflict of Interest impact?
To avoid situations of conflicts of interest, the EU services may withdraw experts from
evaluation or monitoring duties if it deems that this is necessary. You will be informed if this
happens to you and advised as to what to do if you need to take action.
• If you knowingly conceal a conflict of interest and this is discovered during your activities
as an expert, you will be dismissed with immediate effect, your contract will be
terminated and the measures laid down in the contract will be taken.
Example: Submitting proposals for funding while working as an expert
• If you submit a research proposal for evaluation, you are not necessarily excluded from
acting as an expert evaluator, provided that you declare it and that there is no conflict
of interest. In this case, you will not be assigned to evaluate your own proposal or any
proposals which may be competing with it.
We strongly advise you make sure that you have properly understood the provisions laid down
in the Code of Conduct, especially which situations are automatically considered to be a conflict
of interest.
Confidentiality
73EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If your role involves handling classified information, you will need security clearance before
entering into a contract.
The EU publishes an annual list of experts who have worked for us but we do not disclose who
has worked on which proposals.
Before assigning a project to you for monitoring activities, the EU services may inform the
project consortium of your name. The consortium may reject our choice of expert in the
interests of commercial confidentiality.
Payment
Requests for payment
Once your work is completed, you will receive an e-mail inviting you to submit your request
for payment through My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Travel expenses — When you claim your travel expenses, you should upload scanned copies of
all the original supporting documents as requested.
You must keep records and other supporting documents for at least two years after the payment
is made to show that you have complied in full with the terms of your contract.
Deadline — You should submit your request for payment within 30 days of receiving the email
invitation.
Bank account — You should request payment on one of the bank accounts which you have listed
in My Expert Area.
The EU services will make payments within 30 days of receiving the reports, deliverables or
completed payment requests (whichever comes latest) provided they are complete and
approved
Amount of the payment
The daily rate is EUR 450 for work including travel such as participating at evaluations,
monitoring activites or meetings at the commission or beneficiary premises. This is calculated
to the nearest half day (EUR 225) except in the following two cases:
• for remote work carried out by evaluators, any work that you are specifically asked to
carry out remotely will be paid in accordance with Article 4.1 of your contract.
• you are covered by one of the exceptional situations for which a zero fee contract must
be issued (e.g. for former EU staff in receipt of an allowance) or you requested that a
zero fee contract be issued
The contract sets out the maximum total number of days of work (and amount) that you can
be paid for. This is an upper ceiling. The actual amount that you will be paid is based on the
actual task assigned and worked; this may be less than the maximum amount.
• Please note that you will not receive payment for tasks that are not covered by the
contract (or an amendment to it) and which are not specifically assigned to you, either
via the relevant IT system, or in writing by us.
The reimbursement of travel expenses and payments of accommodation allowance and daily
allowance (see below) are made on request and in accordance with the Commission Rules on
the reimbursement of expenses of experts (see the annex of Commission Decision
C(2007)5858).
Travel expenses
74EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
If your contract includes activities involving travel, expenses are refunded for this travel -
normally between the address indicated in the contract (the address registered in your expert
profile) and the meeting venue indicated in Article 3.2 of the contract. If you exceptionally need
to travel to or from a different location than the address in the contract, you need our explicit
agreement prior to purchasing your tickets.
You should book your travel as soon as possible to keep costs reasonable, but you should NOT
book your travel before your contract has been signed by both Parties.
Accommodation and daily allowances
We will also pay accommodation allowances and daily allowances:
• accommodation allowance is EUR 100 per night
• daily allowance is a flat rate of EUR 92 to cover all expenditure at the place where
the meeting/work is held, including meals and local transport (bus, tram, metro, taxi,
parking, motorway tolls, etc.) as well as travel and accident insurance
• experts who live less than 100km from the meeting venue receive a daily allowance
of EUR 46, and are not eligible to receive the accommodation allowance
• allowances may be increased for disabled experts, see below.
Other expenses
Expenses that you incur as a result of special instructions received in writing from the EU
services, different from the contract terms, may be reimbursed in justified cases on presentation
of supporting documents. Please note that no other expenses will be reimbursed.
Taxation issues
You are obliged to ensure compliance with your national legislation on taxes and social security
law – this is your responsibility. Payments you receive are NOT exempted from national taxes.
However, if you are considered to supply a taxable service under national tax law and you are
registered for VAT as a natural person in an EU Member State, you can benefit from a VAT
exemption certificate for EU payments made under your contract.
Please note that in this case your invoice needs to bear a special indication “VAT exemption
/ European Union / Article 151 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC” (specific incidations are
mandatory for some countries, like Belgium, Luxembourg or Italy).
Further information on the VAT situation can be found in the FAQs on the Funding & Tenders
Portal.
Disabilities
If an expert's disability requires that a person accompany them when travelling, then the
travel expenses of that person will also be refunded upon prior request. The EU services will
also pay accommodation allowances and daily allowances to the accompanying person.
Keeping supporting documents:
You must keep records or other supporting documents for two years from the date of the
last payment made under the contract that the work relates to, when you work as an expert.
The EU services may ask you to provide these documents as evidence that the contract was
carried out correctly and that any expenses claimed are genuine.
75EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
7.3 Experts roles and tasks
If you have registered as an expert and have the required profile, the EU service will contact
you in due course to let you know whether you have been selected. This depends on whether
there are any proposals to be evaluated or projects to be monitored requiring your
particular expertise.
Roles and tasks assigned to experts
As an expert, you can perform a variety of roles and tasks:
1. Evaluators are responsible for evaluating proposals submitted in response to a call for
proposals.
Evaluators may also act as a rapporteur, chair, or vice-chair at consensus discussions
or meetings of panels of evaluators. Rapporteurs are responsible for drafting the
consensus report (CR) of a consensus meeting.
2. Observers provide the EU services with independent advice on the conduct and fairness
of all phases of the evaluation process, on how evaluators apply award criteria, and on
how to improve the procedure.
The observer may attend any meeting held during the proposal evaluation process and
drafts a report on the evaluation session observed.
3. Monitors assist EU services in monitoring the implementation of projects that have
received funding, taking into account work descriptions, reports and deliverables.
All experts' tasks are laid down in their contract and its annexes. See the Model Contract for
Experts for further details.
Proposal-evaluation process
The underlying principles to bear in mind during evaluation are:
• Excellence - projects must demonstrate a high level of quality in relation to the topics
and criteria set out in the calls
• Transparency - funding decisions must be based on clearly defined rules and
procedures, and applicants should receive adequate feedback on the outcome of the
evaluation
• Fairness and impartiality - all proposals must be treated equally and evaluated
impartially on their merits, irrespective of their origin or the identity of the applicants
• Confidentiality - all proposals and related data, knowledge and documents must be
treated in confidence
• Speed and efficiency - proposals should be evaluated and grants awarded and
administered as swiftly as possible, without compromising quality or breaking the rules
Award criteria
The award criteria to be applied by the evaluators are set for each programme in the call
conditions .
Thresholds may vary according to the work programme. For two-stage submission schemes,
thresholds and the maximum overall score may vary between the first and the second stage.
76EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Steps in the Process
The diagram below depicts the main steps of the evaluation process and highlights at which
stages the experts intervene
There are three main phases in the experts' involvement in the evaluation process.
Before starting their work, experts are briefed on evaluation procedures (including remote
evaluation), the topics of the relevant calls for proposals and the terms of their contracts. This
briefing can be done in Brussels or remotely (e.g. web-streaming).
For each proposal, experts presents their evaluation results in an individual evaluation
report (IER), explaining the evaluation scores. Expert evaluators also pre-screen each
proposal (on the basis of the applicant's ethics self-assessment) to see if it raises ethical
issues. All evaluation forms are completed online. This report can be completed and
signed remotely or in Brussels.
In principle, proposals will be evaluated initially by at least three experts (in a number of
cases, five or more). However, for the first stage in two-stage submission schemes and
for low-value grants, only two experts may be involved.
A consensus group is convened in order for all the experts who assessed the proposals
in question to discuss the individual evaluation reports and agree on comments and
scores.
The consensus group discussion is led by a moderator (normally an official from the
concerned EU service), who seeks a consensus and ensures that proposals are evaluated
in a fair manner and in line with the established criteria.
The consensus group discussion results in a consensus report (CR) including
justifications of scores and dissenting views, if any. The moderator is responsible for
ensuring that the consensus report reflects the consensus reached. The report is signed
by the rapporteur and the experts evaluating the proposal discussed.
The discussion usually takes place in Brussels and includes experts who participated in
the individual evaluation. It is also possible to convene a remote consensus group.
Panel review consists of reviewing all the proposals within a call, or part of a call, to:
• ensure that the consensus groups have been consistent in their evaluations;
77EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
• if necessary, propose a new set of marks or comments; and
• resolve cases where a consensus could not be reached and a minority view was
recorded in the consensus report.
Exceptionally, in some cases, justified by the specific call circumstances, the outcome of
the consensus group will constitute the final result of the evaluation, and there will be no
panel review. These cases will be signalled in the guidance documents.
The panel review is led by a panel chairperson (normally an official from the concerned
EU service) who ensures fair and equal treatment of the proposals.
The panel review should result in a panel report which includes the evaluation
summary report (ESR) for each proposal, a list of proposals passing all thresholds,
along with a final score, (panel ranked list) and, where necessary, the panel's
recommendations for priority order in the event of equal scores, using the procedure set
out in the work programme. A rapporteur may be appointed to draft the panel report.
Monitoring projects (Technical review)
Projects are monitored to assess the work carried out over a given period and make
recommendations to the EU services. Monitoring may cover scientific, technological and other
aspects of the implementation of the project and Grant Agreement.
The monitoring expert's task is to advise the EU services on how the project has progressed
with regard to:
• the initial work plan
• deliverables
• planned and used resources
• relevance of the objectives
• scientific and industrial quality
• management procedures and methods
• Beneficiaries' contributions, and
• the expected potential impact in scientific, technological, economic, competitive and
social terms, and the plans for the use and dissemination of results.
Depending on the project's complexity and progress, the review may include remote work
entailing reading and analysis of the Grant Agreement, grant decision and other background
information and deliverables and finally drafting the report. The expert may also be required to
attend project meetings at the EU services offices or at the premises of the Beneficiary.
The EU services may require the expert to carry out on-site technical audits to verify whether
critical milestones are being met, or to assist in carrying out research integrity (scientific
misconduct) analysis during implementation.
Types of project monitoring
• Periodic monitoring provided for in the Grant Agreement (generally linked to payment)
• Ad-hoc monitoring, which the EU services can request at any time, where necessary,
and which may involve reviewing financial and technical aspects, or only technical
aspects.
78EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Online Manual: V1.1 – 15.09.2022
Monitoring process
• Review meeting and assessment - experts read all relevant documents before and
attends the review meeting. They then assess the project on the basis of the written
material and information provided at the meeting. In the event of remote monitoring,
the assessment is based on written documents only.
• Monitoring report - the expert draws up the monitoring report on a project, and the
EU service sends it to the consortium via the Coordinator, but it is not made public. If
more than one expert is involved in project monitoring, they issue a single consolidated
report written by a rapporteur.
• Recommendations - the monitor will also assist the EU services by recommending any
changes that may be required. However, the final decision on recommendations and
changes is taken by the EU services alone.
• Observations - Beneficiaries may comment on the monitoring report within one month
of receiving it.
• Project assessment by the EU services? - taking the experts' formal
recommendations into account, the EU services informs the Coordinator of its decision,
which, however, may depart from the recommendations. It may entail
accepting or rejecting the deliverables
o
allowing the project to continue in its existing form
o
suggesting modifications, or
o
taking steps to terminate the Grant Agreement or to exclude a Beneficiary from
o
taking part.

Critical risk A critical risk is a plausible event or issue that could have a high adverse impact
on the ability of the project to achieve its objectives. Level of likelihood to occur
(Low/medium/high): The likelihood is the estimated probability that the risk will
materialise even after taking account of the mitigating measures put in place.
Level of severity (Low/medium/high): The relative seriousness of the risk and
the significance of its effect.
Deliverable A report that is sent to the Commission or Agency providing information to
ensure effective monitoring of the project. There are different types of
deliverables (e.g. a report on specific activities or results, data management
plans, ethics or security requirements).
Impacts Wider long term effects on society (including the environment), the economy
and science, enabled by the outcomes of R&I investments (long term). It refers
to the specific contribution of the project to the work programme expected
impacts described in the destination. Impacts generally occur some time after
the end of the project. Example: The deployment of the advanced forecasting
system enables each airport to increase maximum passenger capacity by 15%
and passenger average throughput by 10%, leading to a 28% reduction in
infrastructure expansion costs.
Milestone Control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may
correspond to the achievement of a key result, allowing the next phase of the
work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if
problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a
critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must
decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development. The
achievement of a milestone should be verifiable.
Objectives The goals of the work performed within the project, in terms of its research and
innovation content. This will be translated into the project’s activities. These
may range from tackling specific research questions, demonstrating the
feasibility of an innovation, sharing knowledge among stakeholders on specific
issues. The nature of the objectives will depend on the type of action, and the
scope of the topic.
Outcomes The expected effects, over the medium term, of projects supported under a
given topic. The results of a project should contribute to these outcomes,
fostered in particular by the dissemination and exploitation measures (including
the uptake, diffusion, deployment, and/or use of the project’s results by direct
target groups). Outcomes generally occur during or shortly after the end of the
project. Example: 9 European airports adopt the advanced forecasting system
demonstrated during the project.
Pathway to Logical steps towards the achievement of the expected impacts of the project
impact over time, in particular beyond the duration of a project. A pathway begins with
the projects’ results, to their dissemination, exploitation and communication,
contributing to the expected outcomes in the work programme topic, and
ultimately to the wider scientific, economic and societal impacts of the work
programme destination.
Research Results generated by the action to which access can be given in the form of
7EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
output scientific publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such
as software, algorithms, protocols and electronic notebooks.
Results What is generated during the project implementation. This may include, for
example, know-how, innovative solutions, algorithms, proof of feasibility, new
business models, policy recommendations, guidelines, prototypes,
demonstrators, databases and datasets, trained researchers, new
infrastructures, networks, etc. Most project results (inventions, scientific works,
etc) are ‘Intellectual Property’, which may, if appropriate, be protected by
formal ‘Intellectual Property Rights’. Example: Successful large-scale
demonstrator: trial with 3 airports of an advanced forecasting system for
proactive airport passenger flow management.
Horizon Europe is divided into three pillars and one part, corresponding to its main
priorities
• The Excellent Science pillar aims to increase the EU’s global scientific
competitiveness. It supports frontier research projects defined and driven by top
researchers themselves through the European Research Council, funds
fellowships for postdoctoral researchers, doctoral training networks and
exchanges for researchers through Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, and invests
in world-class research infrastructures.
• The Global Challenges and European Industrial Competiveness pillar supports
research relating to societal challenges and reinforces technological and
industrial capacities through clusters. It sets EU-missions with ambitious goals
tackling some of our biggest problems. It also includes activities pursued by the
Joint Research Centre which supports EU and national policymakers with
independent scientific evidence and technical support.
• The Innovative Europe pillar aims to make Europe a frontrunner in market-
creating innovation via the European Innovation Council. It also helps to develop
8EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
the overall European innovation landscape through the European Institute of
Innovation and Technology (EIT) which fosters the integration of the knowledge
triangle of education, research and innovation.
• The part Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area
(ERA) increase support to EU Member States in their efforts to make the most of
their national research and innovation potential.
Finally, Horizon Europe will be implemented also through the European Defence Fund
and complemented by the Euratom Research and Training Programme.
Horizon Europe will have a budget of around €95.5 billion for 2021-2027 (current
prices). This includes €5.4 billion (current prices) from NextGenerationEU to boost
recovery and make the EU more resilient for the future, as well as an additional
reinforcement (i.e. in addition to the MFF agreement in July 2020) of €4.6 billion
(current prices).
The Horizon Europe strategic plan sets out overarching strategic orientations for EU
research and innovation investments over the period 2021-2024. Focusing on the
second pillar of Horizon Europe, 'Global challenges and European industrial
competitiveness', it also covers relevant activities in the first pillar, ‘Excellent Science’,
and the third pillar, ‘Innovative Europe’, and the ‘Widening Participation and
Strengthening the European Research Area’ part.
Overall, the aim of the strategic plan is to ensure an effective interface between EU
policy priorities, and programme activities and ultimately, the research and innovation
projects funded by Horizon Europe. The intention is to stimulate research and
innovation investments where they are particularly needed to address the challenges
we are facing, and, most importantly, deliver results.
The Horizon Europe strategic plan defines four key strategic orientations:
• Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of
key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value
chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-
centred technologies and innovations.
• Restoring Europe’s ecosystems and biodiversity, and managing
sustainably natural resources to ensure food security and a clean and healthy
environment.
• Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and
sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy,
construction and production systems.
• Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society,
prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and
providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the
green and digital transitions.
Each of the key strategic orientations encompasses three to four cross-cutting impact
areas, which in turn link to a number of expected impacts. The key strategic
orientations and impact areas are formulated on the basis of the expected impacts,
which have been defined with input from stakeholders, largely bottom-up, during the
strategic planning process. The expected impacts are structured by the six clusters
that make up Horizon Europe’s second Pillar, ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial
9EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Competitiveness’. The expected impacts define the wider effects on society, the
economy and science to be targeted by research and innovation activities, but not the
manner in which to achieve them. This is up to the applicants when designing their
project proposals. In total, the strategic plan defines 32 expected impacts that cover a
wide range of social, economic, ecological and scientific aspirations. Each expected
impact serves as the foundation for a corresponding destination in the relevant work
programme parts.
Furthermore, the strategic plan identifies European co-programmed and co-funded
partnerships, as well as the EU missions and contains orientations regarding cross-
cutting elements of Horizon Europe related to areas for international cooperation,
and key specific issues, such as gender, social sciences and humanities
integration, key enabling technologies, ethics, open science practices, as well
as social innovation and the EU taxonomy.
The Horizon Europe strategic plan is the product of a series of intense co-creation
activities among Commission services and co-design activities with Member States,
members of the European Parliament, stakeholders and citizens at large. This has taken
place through successive rounds of public consultations, web surveys and interactive
workshops, in particular during the annual Research and Innovation Days.
The impact-driven design of Horizon Europe1 aims at maximising the effects of Research
and Innovation investments, ensuring their contribution to the Commission’s policy
priorities.
It marks a paradigm change in the design of the EU R&I Framework Programmes from
an activity-driven to an impact-driven programme.
One of the novelties in the implementation of the Horizon Europe programme which
facilitates such an impact-driven approach is the strategic planning process (as
described above), which identifies the expected impacts of the first four years of
Horizon Europe.
This represents a paradigm change also for the work programmes, that henceforth
builds on this strategic planning. The structure of Horizon Europe work programmes
translates this impact-driven nature: they are organised around ‘Destinations’,
describing the expected impacts identified in the Strategic Planning, and ‘topics’,
describing the related expected outcomes critical to the achievement of such impacts.
This impact design is also translated at project level, with revamped proposal and
reporting templates, allowing for a straightforward monitoring that aims at providing
close-to-real-time information.
Horizon Europe ground breaking approach to monitoring, the Key Impact Pathways2,
aims at capturing and communicating impact around 9 key story lines during and after
the programme implementation. Its objective is to allow policy makers and the wider
public to get regular insights regarding the effects and benefits of the programme on
European science, the economy and wider society3.

European Partnerships bring the Commission and private and/or public partners
together to address some of Europe’s most pressing challenges through concerted
research and innovation initiatives. They are a key implementation tool of Horizon
Europe, and contribute significantly to achieving the EU’s political priorities.
By bringing private and public partners together, European Partnerships help to avoid
the duplication of investments and contribute to reducing the fragmentation of the
research and innovation landscape in the EU.
Find out more about European Partnerships: European Partnerships in Horizon Europe -
European Commission (europa.eu).
The aim of European partnerships with EU and associated countries, the private sector,
foundations and other stakeholders is to deliver on global challenges and modernise
industry.
The Horizon Europe proposal lays down the conditions and principles for establishing
European Partnerships. There are 3 types:
• European Co-programme Partnerships
These are partnerships between the Commission and private and/or public
partners. They are based on memoranda of understanding.
• European Co-funded Partnerships
Partnerships involving EU countries, with research funders and other public
authorities at the core of the consortium.
• European Institutionalised Partnerships
These are partnerships in the field of research and innovation between the
Union, EU member states and/or industry. These partnerships require legislative
proposals from the Commission and are based on a Council Regulation (on the
basis of Article 187 TFEU) or a Decision by the European Parliament and Council
(on the basis of Article 185 TFEU). They are implemented by dedicated
structures created for that purpose. Institutionalised partnerships will only be
implemented where other parts of the Horizon Europe programme, including
other types of partnership, would not achieve the desired objectives or expected
impacts. EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) are also
institutionalised partnerships. EIT KICs aim to address skills shortages and are
already established under Horizon 2020. Key partners in EIT KICs are higher
education institutions, research organisations, companies and other
stakeholders.

EU missions are commitments to solve some of the greatest challenges facing our
world like fighting cancer, adapting to climate change, protecting our oceans, living in
11EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
greener cities and ensuring soil health and food. They are an integral part of Horizon
Europe.
Each mission will operate as a portfolio of actions – such as research projects, policy
measures or even legislative initiatives - to achieve a measurable goal that could not be
achieved through individual actions. EU missions will contribute to the goals of the
European Green Deal, Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan as well as the Sustainable
Development Goals. A wide range of studies and reports informed this approach
(Mission-oriented policy studies and reports - European Commission (europa.eu)).
EU missions will:
• be bold, inspirational and widely relevant to society
• be clearly framed: targeted, measurable and time-bound
• establish impact-driven but realistic goals
• mobilise resources on EU, national and local levels
• link activities across different disciplines and different types of research and
innovation
• make it easier for citizens to understand the value of investments in research
and innovation
Areas where there will be missions:
• Cancer
• Adaptation to climate change including societal transformation
• Healthy oceans, seas coastal and inland waters
• Climate-neutral and smart cities
• Soil health and food

In the context of Horizon Europe, international cooperation is about cooperation with
legal entities established in non-EU countries (third countries). A non-EU country is any
country or territory that is neither an EU Member State nor an overseas country or
territory linked to an EU Member State. Non-EU countries are either associated or not
associated to the Horizon Europe programme.
Overseas countries and territories (OCTs) linked to Member States
Legal entities from OCTs can participate and receive funding under equivalent
conditions as legal entities from Member States.
The OCTs (and their linked Member States) are:
Aruba (NL), Bonaire (NL), Curação (NL), French Polynesia (FR), French Southern
and Antarctic Territories (FR), Greenland (DK), New Caledonia (FR), Saba (NL),
12EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Saint Barthélemy (FR), Sint Eustatius (NL), Sint Maarten (NL), St. Pierre and
Miquelon (FR), Wallis and Futuna Islands (FR).
Third countries associated to Horizon Europe
Association to Horizon Europe is governed by the Horizon Europe Regulation 2021/6954.
Legal entities from associated countries can participate under equivalent conditions as
legal entities from the EU Member States, unless specific limitations or conditions are
laid down in the work programme and/or call/topic text. Such measures could include
the limitation of participation in certain actions to legal entities established in the EU
alone, or in the EU and specified non-EU countries, in order to safeguard the EU’s
strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security. Limitations or conditions may also be
attached to the participation of legal entities established in an eligible country but which
are controlled directly or indirectly by an ineligible country5. The eligibility will be clearly
defined in the work programme. There could also be criteria on the place of
establishment of the legal entity to take into account specific policy requirements or the
nature and objectives of the action6.
Association to Horizon Europe takes place through the conclusion of an international
agreement between the EU and the non-EU country. All sixteen third countries
associated to the previous programme, Horizon 2020, have also expressed interest to
become associated to Horizon Europe. Other third countries have also expressed an
interest in association.
Please see the List of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe for an up-to-date list of
countries with which the association agreements have started to produce legal effects
(either through provisional application or their entry into force).
Until association agreements start producing legal effects either through provisional
application or their entry into force, transitional arrangement may apply if provided for
in the particular Horizon Europe work programme. The transitional arrangements apply
with regard to the countries and legal entities established in these countries, with which
association negotiations are being processed or where association is imminent (see List
of Participating Countries in Horizon Europe).
The list is regularly updated to reflect the status of the negotiations for association.
Third countries associated to Euratom Research and Training Programme
For the Euratom Research and Training Programme,similar rules concerning the
transitional arrangement apply. The list of participating countries contains a separate
list with the participating countries to the Euratom Research and Training Programme.
Other third countries
Most Horizon Europe calls are also open to participants from non-associated countries
and international organisations, unless specific limitations or conditions are laid down in
the work programme and/or the call/topic text, such as those described for associated
countries above.
Moreover, some Horizon Europe calls are particularly relevant for international
cooperation, encouraging or even requiring the participation of entities from non-
4 Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing
Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for
participation and dissemination, and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1290/2013 and (EU) No 1291/2013
(OJ 12.5.2021 L 170/1).

associated non-EU countries in the funded actions. Such calls and topics can be found
by using the filter ‘Quick search on specific priorities’ on the Funding & Tenders Portal
search page (e.g. Africa, Mediterranean).
Participants from non-associated non-EU countries can take part in Horizon Europe
actions — but not always with funding.
For the up-to-date list of low to middle income countries in which entities have to be
established to be automatically eligible for funding, please see the List of
Participating Countries in Horizon Europe.
Participants from other countries (i.e. countries that are neither EU Member States, nor
countries associated to Horizon Europe, nor countries listed above) are not
automatically eligible for funding and therefore by default have to participate at their
own cost. These participants should explain in the proposal how their funding will be
secured.
They can however receive exceptional funding, if:
• their country is explicitly identified in the Horizon Europe work programme and
call for proposals as being eligible for funding
• the granting authority considers that their participation as a beneficiary is
essential for implementing the project, for example in view of their:
o outstanding competence/expertise
o access to particular research infrastructures
o access to particular geographical environments
o access to particular data.
In addition, a number of non-EU/non-associated countries that are not automatically
eligible for funding have made specific provisions for national financing mechanisms for
their participants in Horizon Europe projects. For more information, see Horizon Europe
Complementary funding mechanisms in third countries.
Innovation Actions —In accordance with the 2019 “EU-China - A Strategic outlook”
communication, the 2021 “Global Approach to Research and Innovation”
communication, and the joint conclusions of the 4th EU-China Innovation Cooperation
Dialogue of 2019, an exercise to develop a Joint Roadmap for the future of EU-China
cooperation in science, technology, and innovation (Roadmap) has been established
between the EU and China. It has the objective to develop a level playing field for
engagement between the EU and China in the areas of science, technology, and
innovation (STI) that is respectful of fundamental research and innovation values and
principles. This endeavor is to be achieved through an agreement on the framework
conditions contained in the Roadmap and their monitoring and evaluation. As progress
so far has mainly taken place on the framework conditions linked to research rather
than on those related to innovation, and taking into account the nature and objectives
in particular of Innovation Actions, cooperation with entities established in China needs
to be calibrated accordingly.
Legal entities established in China are therefore not eligible to participate in Horizon
Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries,
affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions,
subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may
be granted on a caseby-case basis for justified reasons. The above eligibility condition
may be reviewed in the future in accordance with policy developments. This exclusion is
justified under Article 22(6) of the Horizon Europe Regulation given the substantive
14EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
concerns regarding the use of intellectual property generated under this publicly funded
programme, and the ongoing discussions between China and the EU on the Joint
Roadmap for the future of EU-China cooperation in science, technology, and innovation.
Restrictions on participation or control — For actions related to EU strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security, the specific topic conditions may limit participation to
legal entities established only in EU Member States or in EU Member States and specific
associated or non-associated third countries. In addition, for duly justified and
exceptional reasons, to guarantee protection of the strategic interests of the EU and its
Member States, the specific call conditions may also exclude the participation of legal
entities directly or indirectly controlled by non-eligible third countries or by legal entities
of non-eligible third countries (or make their participation subject to specific
conditions), in line with Article 22(5) of the Horizon Europe Regulation. In this case, the
eligible countries will be identified in the specific call conditions.
EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article
29 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU (TFEU)7 as well as Article 75 TFEU8, are not eligible to participate
in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third
parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to
third parties (if any).
Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled
territories of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the
involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the
implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established
in Russia, Belarus, or in nongovernment controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore,
even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities
are not eligible to participate in any capacity9. This includes participation as
beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind
contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
International organisations
International European research organisations are automatically eligible to receive
funding from Horizon Europe. International European research organisations are defined
as international organisations, the majority of whose members are EU Member States
or associated countries, and whose principal objective is to promote scientific and
technological cooperation in Europe.
For what concerns participation in Horizon Europe actions, international European
research organisations are deemed to be established in a Member State other than the
ones in which the other legal entities participating in the action are established.
As regards all other international organisations:
• For European Research Council frontier research actions, training and mobility
actions and when provided for in the work programme, international
organisations with headquarters in a Member State or associated country are

over that of the EU Sanctions Map.
8 Please note that the EU Official Journal contains the official list and, in case of conflict, its content prevails
over that of the EU Sanctions Map.
9 However, natural persons established in Russia, Belarus or in non-government controlled territories of
Ukraine may participate in Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions provided that they are not subject to EU
restrictive measures and comply with all other relevant conditions, including the specific eligibility and
other conditions set out in part 2 of the work programme.
15EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
deemed to be established in that Member State or associated country, and thus
automatically eligible for funding from Horizon Europe.
• In all other cases, international organisations are not automatically eligible for
funding from Horizon Europe, and they may exceptionally receive funding only
if:
o they are identified in the relevant Horizon Europe work programme as
being eligible for funding or
o the granting authority considers that their participation is deemed
essential for implementing the action, for example in view of their:
▪ outstanding competence/expertise
▪ access to particular research infrastructures
▪ access to particular geographical environments
▪ access to particular data.
Foreign interference in Research & Innovation
The Commission has published a toolkit for tackling R&I foreign interference. This
document provides a number of recommendations relating to values, governance,
partnerships, and cybersecurity, which are designed to provide support to higher
education institutions and research performing organisations in their international R&I
engagement. All participants in Horizon Europe are recommended to familiarise
themselves with the document, and any equivalent advice that exists at national level,
and to consider their relevance for the proposals they intend to submit.
Horizon Europe sets gender equality as a cross-cutting principle and aims to
eliminate gender inequality and intersecting socio-economic inequalities
throughout research and innovation systems, including by addressing unconscious bias
and systemic structural barriers.
The strengthened provisions for gender equality under Horizon Europe address three
different levels and include the following:
• A new eligibility criterion to get access to Horizon Europe funding: public
bodies, research organisations and higher education establishments from
Member States and associated countries are required, as of calls with deadlines
in 2022, to have in place a gender equality plan (GEP). Details on this
requirement are specified in General Annex B — Eligibility and additional
guidance is available through this webpage, including a link to Frequently Asked
Questions accessible through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
• The integration of the gender dimension into research and innovation
content across the Programme is an operational objective for Horizon Europe,
and becomes a requirement by default.
• Particular attention is being paid to ensuring gender balance, with a target of
50% women in Horizon Europe related advisory bodies such as boards and
expert groups, as well as in evaluation panels. Gender balance among
researchers involved in projects is strongly encouraged as well, and will be
taken into account as a ranking criterion for ex aequo proposals.
16EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Researchers have the possibility to self-identify in proposals and project
reporting according to three gender categories: woman, man, or non-binary.
In addition:
• Specific funding will be made available for actions supporting the development of
inclusive gender equality plans in research and innovation organisations across
Member States and associated countries, under the Widening Participation
and Strengthening the European Research Area Programme Part.
• Specific funding will also be allocated to gender studies and intersectional
research, in particular under Pillar II, Cluster 2 - Culture, Creativity and
Inclusive Society.
• Flagship measures and activities for promoting gender equality are introduced
under Pillar III, in particular through the European Innovation Council (EIC),
including a target of 40% women-led companies invited to pitch their projects in
the Accelerator instrument, a target of 50% women among members of EIC
advisory structures, a dedicated initiative to support women-led deep-tech start-
ups, and the continuation of the EU prize for women innovators.
These strenghtened provisions are also detailed on the Commission’s Gender equality in
research and innovation policy webpage, and summarised in the factsheet Gender
equality: a strengthened commitment in Horizon Europe. A detailed Guidance
document has been developed to support organisations to meet the Horizon Europe GEP
eligibility criterion. Additionally, a dedicated webinar with a focus on GEPs in available
online to help participants comply with the eligibility criterion.
In this Programme Guide, we focus more specifically on the integration of the gender
dimension into research and innovation (R&I) content, and refer the reader to the links
provided above and to the following webinar for further guidance on the other gender
equality aspects addressed in Horizon Europe and to be taken into account by
applicants.
Integration of the gender dimension into R&I content: a requirement under
Horizon Europe
The integration of the gender dimension into R&I content is mandatory. It is a
requirement set by default across all work programmes, destinations and topics, unless
its non-relevance for a specific topic is specified in the topic description, e.g. by the
mention “In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender
analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement”.
This new requirement to integrate the gender dimension by default in R&I content in
projects is recalled in the General Introduction to the Horizon Europe Work Programme,
and in the General Annex D — Award Criteria (for Research and innovation actions,
Innovation actions and Programme co-fund actions) and it is thus reflected in the
corresponding application forms (proposal template) for Research and Innovation
Actions, Innovation Actions and Programme Co-fund Actions under the Excellence
evaluation criterion (under Methodology).
In the proposal template, applicants are invited to describe how the gender dimension
(i.e. sex and/or gender analysis) is taken into account in the project’s R&I content. If
applicants do not consider such a gender dimension to be relevant in their specific
project, they should provide a sound justification, which will be taken into account
during evaluation of the proposal, e.g. with appropriate scientific references.
What does integrating the gender dimension in R&I content mean?
17EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
It is an umbrella term covering the integration of sex and/or gender analysis through
the entire R&I cycle, from the setting of research priorities through defining concepts,
formulating research questions, developing methodologies, gathering and analysing
sex/gender disaggregated data, to evaluating and reporting results and transferring
them to markets into products and innovations which will benefit all citizens and
promote gender equality. Addressing the gender dimension in research and
innovation thus entails taking into account sex and gender in the whole R&I
process. It is different from addressing issues of gender balance and equal
opportunities among the project’s team members or among participants to events (e.g.
conferences) organised by the project.
Definitions of key related terms:
• Sex refers to biology. Sex is determined by several biological features, according to
functions that derive from the chromosomal complement, reproductive organs, or
specific hormones or environmental factors that affect the expression of phenotypic
traits (morphology) in sexually reproducing organisms. In humans, sex refers to the
biological attributes that distinguish male, female, or intersex. In non-human
animals, sex refers to biological attributes that distinguish male, female, or
hermaphrodite. In engineering & product design research, sex includes anatomical
and physiological characteristics that may impact the design of products, systems,
and processes. Sex differences may be relevant for many R&I projects.
• Gender refers to sociocultural norms, identities and relations that categorise people,
structure societies and organisations, and shape behaviours, products, technologies,
environments, and knowledge. Gender attitudes and behaviours are complex and
change across time and place, as cultural norms and values change. How we speak,
our mannerisms, the things we use and our behaviours all signal who we are and
establish rules for interaction. Gender is an organising principle that structures
behaviours, attitudes, physical appearance and habits. We generally consider three
related dimensions of gender: gender norms (socio-cultural expectations of what is
appropriate for women, men or gender-diverse individuals, often relying on gender
stereotypes), gender identities (how individuals or groups perceive and present
themselves in relation to gender norms, with most commonly used categories
including: woman, man, and non-binary or gender-diverse) and gender relations
(how sex and gender shape social interactions in families, schools, workplaces and
public settings, often involving power relations). As such, gender can be an
important aspect of research and design.
• Intersectionality describes overlapping or intersecting categories such as gender,
ethnicity/racial origin, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation and geographic
location, that compound to determine the identities and experiences of individuals.
Researchers and innovators should not consider gender in isolation. Gender
identities, norms and relations both shape and are shaped by other social attributes.
Why is the gender dimension important?
An increasing body of studies shows that the quality, reproducibility and accountability
of research and innovation are affected by not taking into account sex and gender
analysis. And in many fields, it is crucial to explore whether research outcomes may
affect women and men differently. For instance:
• Why do we observe differences between women and men in infection levels and
mortality rates in the COVID-19 pandemic? Does it make sense to study
cardiovascular diseases only on male animals and on men, or osteoporosis only
on women? And did you know that pheromones given off by men experimenters,
but not women, induce a stress response in laboratory mice sufficient to trigger
pain relief?
18EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Did you know that many aspects of taxation have a substantial effect on gender-
related socioeconomic inequalities, but that when designing tax laws,
policymakers still rarely consider gender inequalities?
• Does it make sense to design car safety equipment only on the basis of male
body standards?
• Did you know that almost 3/4 of women Internet users worldwide have
experienced some form of cyberviolence?
• Why do household travel surveys, and thus mobility analysis and transport
planning, underrate trips performed as part of caring work, which are
predominantly undertaken by women?
• Is it ethical to develop AI products that could spread gender and racial biases
due to a lack of diversity in the data used in training AI applications?
• Did you know that climate change is affecting sex determination in a number of
marine species and that certain populations are now at risk of extinction?
Integrating sex and gender analysis into R&I content improves the scientific quality
and societal relevance of the produced knowledge, technologies and
innovation. It:
• adds value to research and innovation in terms of excellence, creativity, rigor,
reproducibility and business opportunities
• helps researchers and innovators question gender norms and stereotypes, and
rethink standards and reference models
• leads to an in-depth understanding of all people’s needs, behaviours, and
attitudes
• contributes to the production of goods and services better suited to new markets
• is crucial to secure Europe’s leadership in science & technology and support
inclusive and sustainable growth.
Therefore, when drafting a proposal, you should in particular:
• Reflect on why sex and/or gender could matter: Think about and present
the ways in which taking into account the gender dimension will provide added
value in terms of creativity, excellence, and return on investment, both from
public and private perspectives.
• Consider the production of new knowledge on gender: Consider what is
already known in your area in terms of the gender dimension (e.g. related
scientific literature) and identify what is missing. In many areas, gender
knowledge still needs to be generated.
• Include sex and gender aspects as part of a multidisciplinary approach:
Reflecting on sex and gender considerations in relation to health, transport,
energy, security, etc. is a great opportunity to foster cooperation between
scientists with gender expertise and others. It helps concepts cross the borders
of scientific fields and encourages research methods to evolve.
• Consider social categories/factors intersecting with sex and gender: the
way a research problem is formulated will determine which intersecting variables
are relevant for analysis. Intersectional research should be designed to
19EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
illuminate the multiplicative effects of different, but interdependent, categories
and factors.
Guidance and concrete examples (including those mentioned above) on how to
better integrate sex and gender based analyses into R&I content under Horizon Europe
have been developed by the Commission’s Expert Group on Gendered Innovations
under the coordination of DG R&I’s Gender Sector.
A full policy report has been prepared and is available to support applicants.
Entitled Gendered Innovations 2: How inclusive analysis contributes to research and
innovation and publicly released by the European Commission on 25 November 2020, it
is available here, through the Europa website dedicated to gender equality policy in
R&I.
The report contains: full definitions of terms; both general and field-specific methods
for sex analysis, gender analysis and intersectional approaches; fifteen case studies
covering health, climate change, energy, agriculture, urban planning, waste
management, transport, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies, taxation,
venture funding, as well as COVID-19; and policy recommendations to address the
global challenges, targeted impacts and key R&I orientations of the six Horizon Europe
Clusters, as well as Mission Areas, and European partnerships.

SSH in the R&I chain
Under Horizon Europe, the effective integration of social SSH in all clusters, including all
Missions and European partnerships, is a principle throughout the programme. The aim
of SSH integration is to improve our assessment of and response to complex societal
issues. Thus, SSH are a key constituent of research and innovation, especially regarding
the twin green and digital transitions.
Therefore, where relevant, the R&I chain should include contributions from SSH
disciplines such as sociology, economics, psychology, political science, history, cultural
sciences or/and the arts. See the list of SSH disciplines below.
Project requirements - SSH flagged topics
Many topics invite contributions from the SSH, often in collaboration with non-SSH
disciplines such as natural and physical sciences, health sciences or technology. These
topics have been 'flagged' and can be found on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
Proposals under these topics are expected to integrate the SSH perspective (social,
economic, behavioural, institutional, historical and/or cultural dimensions etc), as
appropriate. Applicants should therefore ensure that:
• contributions from SSH disciplines are integrated throughout their proposed
project, and
• the actions required, participants and disciplines involved as well as the added
value of SSH contributions are clearly stated in the proposal.
The SSH methodologies used in the projects should be described, or if the applicant
consortium considers that SSH is not relevant to their particular proposal, they should
explain why.
Where relevant, applicants are also encouraged to include contributions from the SSH in
a project proposal under any call, even if it is not SSH-flagged.
Evaluation
When evaluating a proposal submitted to a topic that was 'flagged' for SSH
contributions, experts will first refer to the topic description to identify what the
expected contributions are. With this in mind, they will evaluate the contributions from
SSH in the proposal, according to the criteria.
Experts should be mindful that a successful contribution from SSH, depending on the
topic, may require collaboration among various SSH disciplines and/or between SSH
and non-SSH disciplines.
A proposal without a sufficient contribution/integration of SSH research and
competences will receive a lower evaluation score.
Even if proposals do not belong to a topic 'flagged' for SSH contributions, they may
contain contributions from the SSH disciplines, which should be evaluated with other
relevant aspects of the proposal.
21EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024

Innovations originate from many sources. They stem not only from advances in science
and technology, but also from creative uses of existing knowledge and technologies as
well as inventiveness in the non-technical and social spheres.
Social innovation concerns the development of new products, methods, and services for
and with society involving citizens, public authorities, business and industry, and
academia — the Quadruple Helix — in their design, development, and implementation.
Social innovation engages and empowers citizens, enhances the resilience of
communities, increases the relevance, acceptance and uptake of innovation, and helps
foster lasting changes in social practices, therefore acting as a system changer.
It thus helps answering societal and environmental challenges, connecting society with
innovation.
Social Innovation in Horizon Europe
Social innovation has been identified as a cross-cutting specific issue in Horizon Europe
and concerns all programme parts. Indeed, it holds potential to develop solutions
answering at once multiple interconnected challenges. Moreover, embedding social
innovation into the scope of a topic enhances the chances of uptake of the results of the
project by involving intended users from the beginning of the project to listen to them,
understand their needs, and benefit from their knowledge and creativity. Therefore, it
increases the delivery of the outcomes and impact expected from the project.
22EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
In Horizon Europe, social innovation will serve the environmental, economic, digital,
cultural, sovereignty, and democratic priorities set by the von der Leyen Commission.
In particular, social innovation will support changes towards socially, environmentally,
and economically sustainable social practices. More specifically, the integration of social
innovation on Horizon Europe is relevant to address global challenges – including in
areas such as health and care, also in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the twin
green and digital transitions, climate change mitigation and adaptation or citizen
engagement and deliberative democracy.
The above has been reflected by flagging specific topics and encouraging applicants to
consider social innovation as a way to meet the topic’s objectives, and by dedicating
topics to social innovation.

For all activities funded by the EU, the ethical dimension is an integral part of research
from beginning to end, and ethical compliance is seen as pivotal to achieve real
research excellence. There is a clear need to make a thorough ethical evaluation from
the conceptual stage of the proposal not only to respect the legal framework but also to
enhance the quality of the research. Ethical research conduct implies the application of
fundamental ethical principles and legislation to scientific research in all possible
domains of research. This includes the adherence to the highest standards of research
integrity as described in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity.
The process to assess and address the ethical dimension of activities funded under
Horizon Europe is called the Ethics Appraisal Procedure.
Objectives
In addition to the scientific evaluation focusing on the scientific merit, the quality of the
management and the potential impact, the Ethics Appraisal ensures that all research
activities carried out under Horizon Europe are conducted in compliance with
fundamental ethical principles.
Ethics Appraisal Procedure
The Ethics Appraisal Procedure concerns all activities funded in Horizon Europe and
includes the Ethics Review Procedure, conducted before the start of the project, as well
as Ethics Checks, Reviews and Audits conducted during the project.
When preparing a proposal, it is required to conduct an Ethics Self-assessment starting
with the completion of an Ethics Issues Table. You can read further practicalities in
the How to complete your ethics self-assessment guide.
Ethics Review Procedure
All proposals above threshold and considered for funding will undergo an Ethics Review
carried out by independent ethics experts. The Review starts with the Ethics Screening
which can include, in the cases where there is no ethics issue identified in the proposal,
a pre-screening to confirm or not the absence of ethics issues (this check can be
conducted by qualified staff). If appropriate a further analysis called the Ethics
23EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Assessment is conducted. The Ethics Assessment can lead to ethics requirements
that become contractual obligations.
The Ethics Review Procedure focusses on the compliance with ethical rules and
standards, relevant European legislation, international conventions and declarations,
national authorisations and ethics approvals, proportionality of the research methods
and the applicants' awareness of the ethical aspects and social impact of their planned
research.
The ethics review covers issues as:
• human rights and protection of human beings
• animal protection and welfare
• data protection and privacy
• health and safety
• environmental protection
• artificial intelligence
It may also cover issues of research integrity, including, fabrication, falsification and
plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research or in reporting research
results; this includes misrepresenting credentials and improprieties of authorship.
Ethics Screening
The Ethics Screening is carried out during the scientific evaluation or soon after. The
ethics experts are asked to flag the proposals that have serious or complex issues (on
the basis of the Guidelines on serious and complex ethics issues) that will be the
subject of a more in-depth analysis (Ethics assessment). Proposals involving the use of
human Embryonic Stems Cells (hESCs) or human Embryos (hE) automatically proceed
to the second step, the Ethics Assessment.
Further to the Ethics screening, the proposals that will be funded and are not flagged as
serious or complex must handle the ethics issues in the proposed activities in line with
National and European legislation and practice and the How to complete your ethics
self-assessment guide. The ethics summary report will list the main ethics issues
identified in your proposal. Ethics screening will not issue ethics requirements but can
lead to the obligation to nominate an external independent ethics advisor or board to
assist the project in adhering to the relevant ethical and legal standards.
Ethics Assessment
For the limited number of proposals flagged as serious or complex and for all the
proposals involving the use of hESCs or hE, the Ethics Screening is followed by an
Ethics Assessment prior to the signature of the grant agreement.
The Ethics Assessment is an in-depth analysis of the ethical issues of the proposals,
taking into account the analysis made during the Ethics screening. The Ethics
Assessment can lead to ethics requirements that are inserted as obligations in the grant
agreement.
If the proposal undergoes an Ethics Assessment, you will receive an ethics summary
report with an ethics opinion on your proposal. The possible outcomes of the ethics
assessment are:
1. Ethics clearance
24EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
The ethics issues are appropriately addressed. The ethics section in the proposal
can be transferred mostly unchanged to the ethics section in Part B of the
description of the action (DoA).
2. Conditional ethics clearance
In this case clearance is subject to conditions. Your ethics summary report will
list one or more 'ethics requirements'. These may include:
• regular reporting to the Commission or the agency concerned
• appointing an independent ethics advisor or ethics board (possibly with a
task to report on compliance with ethics requirements)
• supplying further information/documents
• adjusting methodology so as to comply with ethical principles and relevant
legislation
Ethics requirements must be implemented during grant preparation or during the
grant implementation.
• Ethics requirements due before grant signature normally require that
you update the ethics section in the narrative part (Part B) of the DoA
(Annex 1). However, other parts of Annex 1 may also be affected.
Exceptionally, additional supporting documents may be required before the
grant agreement can be signed.
• Ethics requirements due after project start are automatically included in
the grant agreement in the form of 'ethics deliverables'.
Tasks of the coordinator or sole applicant:
• update the DoA whenever appropriate to address the ethics requirements
and describe how they are to be met in the course of the project
• provide supporting documents if exceptionally requested before grant
signature
• take into account any recommendations set out in the ethics summary
report.
3. Request for additional information (intermediate outcome)
You may be asked to provide additional information if this is needed to complete
the ethics assessment (e.g. in case of serious or complex ethics issues or
missing information).
4. No ethics clearance
After the second ethics assessment, if your proposal is not given ethics
clearance, it is not eligible for funding and will be rejected.
You will be informed of
• the decision to reject your proposal
• the reasons for the decision
• how you can appeal against it.
25EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Ethics requirements and ethics work package
Ethics deliverables: All ethics requirements due after project start are automatically
included in the grant agreement in the form of deliverables. These deliverables are
known as 'ethics deliverables' and will be placed in an automatically generated work
package called 'ethics requirements'.
Work package 'ethics requirements' - if applicable - is added to your grant agreement
as soon as the ethics assessment has been completed. At this point in time it will
appear as the last work package in the list of work packages (WP). During grant
preparation you can move this WP to any other position in the list by drag & drop. It is
recommended to keep the 'ethics requirements' WP at the end of the list where it will
not affect the numbering of the other work packages.
Ethics checks, reviews and audits
During the Ethics Screening or the Ethics Assessment, the experts identify the projects
that need an Ethics Check or Review, which are executed during the course of the
research project. The procedure can also be initiated by the Commission services.
The objective of the procedure is to assist the beneficiaries to deal with the ethics
issues raised by their research and if necessary to take preventive or/and corrective
measures. The Ethics check is an internal check by the project officer or ethics officer
who may be supported by ethics experts and the Ethics Review is an elaborate review
and in-depth procedure carried out by up to 5 external ethics experts. They are both
conducted on the basis of the information provided by the concerned beneficiaries, who
may be invited to a meeting in Brussels to discuss the issues at stake. Onsite visits can
also be organised during the Ethics Reviews.
In case of substantial breach of ethical principles, research integrity or relevant
legislation, the Commission can carry out an Ethics Audit following the provisions and
procedures laid down in the grant agreement.
The checks, post-grant reviews and audits can result in an amendment of the grant
agreement. In severe cases, it can lead, upon the decision of the Commission services
to a reduction of the grant, its termination or any other appropriate measures, in
accordance with the provisions of the grant agreement.

Activities carried out under the programme must comply with the applicable security
rules and in particular, rules on the protection of classified information against
unauthorised disclosure, including compliance with any relevant EU and national law.
Where appropriate, the actions carried out under the Horizon Europe Programme must
comply with Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444, and its implementing rules.
The Horizon Europe Model Grant Agreement includes specific security related obligations
(Article 13 and Annex 5). The Horizon Europe Programme Security Instruction (PSI) has
to be followed in case a proposal selected for funding will lead to a project that involves
classified information.
The process to assess and address the security dimension of activities funded under
Horizon Europe is called the Security Appraisal Procedure.
Security Appraisal Procedure
The Security Appraisal Procedure concerns all activities funded under Horizon Europe
and includes three main steps: the Security Self-assessment, performed by the
applicants at the proposal preparation stage, the Security Review Procedure, conducted
before the start of the project, as well as the Security checks, conducted during or after
the life of the project.
Security Self-assessment
When preparing a proposal to be submitted under any of the Horizon Europe calls, the
applicant is required to conduct a Security Self-assessment starting with the completion
of a Security Issues Table. In case the proposal is submitted under a call or topic, which
is a priori flagged by the Commission as security sensitive, the applicant is also required
to complete a Security Section. Further information and guidance can be found in the
How to handle security-sensitive projects guide.
Security Review
Only proposals above threshold and considered for funding will undergo a Security
Review carried out by granting authority and Commission qualified staff, as well as by
national security experts.
The Security Review includes three steps: the Security Pre-screening performed by the
granting authority, the Security Screening performed by the Commission and the
Security Scrutiny conducted by national security experts. The Security Review is
28EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
organised based on whether the call or topic, under which a proposal is submitted, is
security sensitive or not and it can lead to security requirements that become
contractual obligations.
The Security Review Procedure focusses on the compliance with security rules and in
particular, on the protection of sensitive and classified information against unauthorised
disclosure. The objective of the Security Review is to identify and address security
issues that could emerge from the research by adopting appropriate mitigation
measures.
Security Pre-screening
The first phase of the Security Review Procedure, the Security Pre-Screening, is carried
out by qualified staff of the granting authority, during the scientific evaluation or soon
after, in the following cases:
• If the proposal has been submitted under a call or topic not flagged as security
sensitive and the applicant has replied positively to at least one of the questions
in the Security Issues table.
• If the proposal has been submitted under a call or topic not flagged as security
sensitive and the applicant has replied negatively to all the questions in the
Security Issues table, but the granting authority has, nevertheless, detected
security issues.
Security Screening
The Security Screening is performed by qualified staff of the Commission. All the
proposals that have gone through the Security Pre-screening will be automatically sent
to the second phase of the Security Review. During this phase, the Commission (DG
HOME) will assess the results of the pre-screening and decide whether the launch of the
third phase of the procedure, the Security Scrutiny, is needed.
Security Scrutiny
The Security Scrutiny is the last phase of the Security Review and it is conducted by the
Security Scrutiny Group, comprised of national security experts appointed in close
cooperation with the relevant Programme Committee and the competent National
Security Authorities. It is chaired by the Commission. The Security Scrutiny will be
carried out prior to the signature of the grant agreement in the following cases:
• Automatically, if the proposal has been submitted under a call or topic flagged as
security sensitive.
• In other cases, if the Security Screening has concluded that the proposal is very
likely to raise security issues for which mitigation measures should be proposed.
The objective of the Security Scrutiny is to identify security concerns in a certain
proposal, assess if sensitive or classified information will be used or produced by a
certain project, verify whether the security issues have been properly addressed by the
applicant and propose recommendations in order to properly address the identified
security issues. The purpose of the Security Scrutiny is to address potential misuse of
project results (e.g. results that could be channelled into crime or terrorism or results
that could adversely affect critical infrastructure). For additional information, see the
Guidance note on potential misuse of research. The information is classified according
to the Guidelines on the classification of information in Horizon Europe projects.
The Security Scrutiny may result in security requirements that, in principle, will have
to be fulfilled by the beneficiaries before the signature of the Grant Agreement. The
security requirements may include limiting the dissemination level of certain
29EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
deliverables for security reasons, classifying certain deliverables or other security
recommendations. Other security recommendations may include appointing a Project
Security Officer, establishing a Security Advisory Board, ensuring that personnel has
followed security trainings, limiting the level of detail, using a fake scenario, excluding
the use of classified information, adjusting the scope of a certain work package etc.
As the result of the Security Scrutiny a security summary report will be produced. It will
contain the security opinion and security recommendations. It will be provided to the
applicants at the stage of the grant preparation in order to implement the security
requirements.
The possible outcomes of the Security Scrutiny are:
1. No security concern
No security issues were identified in the proposal. No need for the Grant
Agreement to include a security section.
2. Security recommendations and/or security classification
The security summary report will list one or more security requirements. These
requirements should be set out in the security section of Part B of the DoA of the
Grant Agreement and may include:
• security recommendation to limit the dissemination level of certain
deliverables for security reasons
• classification of certain deliverables at a certain level (the classification
levels applied in Horizon Europe research projects are RESTREINT UE/EU
RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET UE/EU
SECRET)
• appointment of a Project Security Officer in case of classified deliverables
• establishment of a Security Advisory Board
• other security recommendations.
The security requirements must be implemented during grant preparation and
before grant signature. You will be required to update the security section in
the narrative part (Part B) of the DoA (Annex 1). In certain exceptional cases,
security requirements will be implemented during the grant implementation, e.g.
issue of Personnel Security Clearance.
3. Proposal too sensitive to be funded
The Security Scrutiny may reveal that the information to be used or generated
by the project is too sensitive, or that the applicants lack the right experience,
skills or authorisations to handle classified information at the appropriate level.
In such cases, funding is refused and the proposal is rejected.
If this happens, your report will contain the following information:
• the decision to reject your proposal;
• the reasons for the rejection, except if they are classified;
• the way to appeal against it.

Dissemination and exploitation is an obligation and opportunity for a project to
further scale-up the results, shed light on the work done and bring value to it by
creating a positive impact in various fields.
Dissemination and Exploitation activities help to diffuse knowledge, increase the use of
Research & Innovation (R&I) projects results in the EU and beyond and support a more
robust evidence-based policy making.
What is dissemination and exploitation?
They can be defined as:
• Dissemination: the public disclosure of the results by appropriate means (other
than resulting from protecting or exploiting the results), including by scientific
publications in any medium.
• Exploitation: the use of results in further research and innovation activities
other than those covered by the action concerned, including among other things,
commercial exploitation such as developing, creating, manufacturing and
marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in
standardisation activities.
• Results: Results’ means any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as
data, know-how or information, whatever its form or nature, whether or not it
can be protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual
property rights.
31EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
How should you address dissemination and exploitation?
The rules for participation under Horizon Europe10 reinforce focus on exploitation,
in particular within the EU as well as the role of the plan for the dissemination and
exploitation during and after the end of the project.
Unless the work programme states otherwise11, proposals should include a planned
summary of communication, dissemination and exploitation activities that they
will carry out to achieve the expected impact.
• If the expected exploitation of the results entails developing, creating,
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing
a service, the plan should include a strategy for such exploitation.
• If the plan provides for the exploitation of the results primarily in non-associated
third countries, the legal entities must explain how that exploitation is still to be
considered to be in the EU interest.
If the proposal is successful, then the beneficiaries must provide (normally with the first
six months of the action) and regularly update the complete Plan for the
exploitation and dissemination of results including communication activities.
Beneficiaries must also report on the activities undertaken.
The applicant already at the stage of forming the consortium should pay attention to
eventual and expected results, ownership issues and the associated intellectual property
rights (IPR) with a view to disseminating and exploiting the results efficiently.
• The consortium agreement sets the framework for successful project
implementation and results exploitation including intellectual property
management, and is meant to settle if already possible all issues that might
hamper the smooth and seamless cooperation of the different actors for the
different parts of the project.
• Having a consortium agreement with clear IPR management and ownership
rights agreed by the consortium members can maximise the exploitation
potential of the project’s results.
• The consortium agreement should in principle be negotiated and concluded
before signing the grant agreement, and should complement the grant
agreement but must not contain any provision contrary to it.
• The consortium agreement is a private agreement between the beneficiaries
setting out the rights and obligations amongst themselves, and does not involve
the Commission/Agency.
During the implementation of the project and after the end of the action the
beneficiaries:
• must use their best efforts to exploit the research results or have them
exploited by another legal entity. If, despite a beneficiary's best efforts to exploit
its results directly or indirectly, the results are not exploited within one year
after the end of the action (as established in the grant agreement), the
10 Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing
Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for
participation and dissemination, and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1290/2013 and (EU) No 1291/2013
(OJ 12.5.2021 L 170/1).
11 Some proposers (e.g. applying in response to a European Research Council call, or the Marie-Sklodowska
Curie Actions-COFUND programme) are exempted from this obligation. Please refer to the work
programme.
32EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
beneficiary must (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the granting authority)
use the Horizon Results Platform to find interested parties to exploit the
results.
• where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations (including
obligations linked to the restriction of participation or control due to strategic
assets, interests, autonomy or security reasons), must comply with them — up
to four years after the end of the action.
• should also disseminate their results as soon as feasible, in a publicly available
format. Beneficiaries that intend to disseminate their results must give advance
notice to the other beneficiaries in the action. Any other beneficiary may object if
it can show that dissemination of the results would significantly harm its
legitimate interests in relation to its results or background. In such cases, the
results must not be disseminated unless appropriate steps are taken to
safeguard those legitimate interests.
The beneficiaries must update the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of
the results including communication activities, during and after the end of the action, in
accordance with the grant agreement.
To enhance dissemination and exploitation impact, the EU offers a wide range of
services free of charge such as Horizon Results Booster, Horizon Results Platorm, to
assist beneficiaries in dissemination and exploitation activities and to enhance visibility
of results.
Guidelines for your dissemination, exploitation and communication activities
We suggest you take a step-by-step approach to dissemination, exploitation and
communication activities while developing your proposal for an application and during
the implementation of the project. The guidelines below clarify key concepts and
provide with practical examples. They are by no mean compulsory.
The dissemination and exploitation part
1. Prepare your planned summary of communication, dissemination and
exploitation activities carefully.
This must be a distinct part of your proposal (unless excluded by the call conditions). As
it is too early to know what kind of results you will obtain, at this stage we only expect
a planned summary of communication, dissemination and exploitation activities. If
proposal is selected, you will be asked to submit a complete plan within 6 months after
the date of signature of your grant agreement and regularly update it.
In order to give you an idea of how these recommendations could be described in your
proposal, please see the following example of a water treatment project:
o Identify the problem/need to address
Example: In a context of pandemic, the current sand water treatment does not
filter against viruses. It requires the use of iodine and chlorine which in large
quantity may have an impact on health and the environment. Chlorine also has a
taste that makes it unpleasant for the consumer who then resorts to bottled
water.
o Check what is the current offer (e.g. the current existing solutions offered by
competitors)
33EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Example: The market usually offers: Reverse Osmosis (R.O.) Membranes,
Ultrafiltration (U.F.) Membranes, Micro-Filtration (M.F.) Membrane, Nano-
Filtration (N.F.) Membrane
o Describe what is the added value of your research, technology,
methodology
Example: Using techniques issued from biomimetics, to filter the water and
combat the viruses like live organisms do in nature
o Identify the Key Exploitable Result(s) (KER)
Example: Our KER will be an eco-friendly biomimetic membrane for filtering
water thereby removing 99% of viruses in water treatment plants.
o Explain what the outcome is (do not confuse it with the expected impact
to be addressed in the canvas of the application)
Example of the outcome: We would like to create a filtering membrane to treat
tap water. At the end of the project, the technology should be used by 10 water
treatment plants.
The expected impact will be: For companies and water treatment plants, our
technology is expected to reduce the costs in the long run (after the initial
investment) and the use of chemical product to treat the water. We plan on
testing the technology in X region(s) of the EU and this environmental friendly
technology should encourage help reducing the use of plastic bottles by
consumers who would then drink tap water.
o Identify the target groups (early adopters)
Example:
Target group: water treatment equipment manufacturers (filter manufacturers)
End users: water treatment plants that have been approached by the consortium
and agreed to test the technology
o Describe dissemination measures and channels to reach out to your
target audience
Example of dissemination measures: Organising visits for potential investors
and/or B2B to the demo plant. Participation in events such as trade fair
dissemination to increase awareness of our project amongst target user base,
including international conferences on water management & environment
o Describe exploitation measures
Examples of exploitation measures:
− Create a Demo plant to show the UVP (Unique Value Proposition) of the novel
solution
− Establish contacts with industry (B2B) e.g. scan main players in the water
treatment and gather information about the dynamics of target markets
− Reach out to end-users (regional water authorities, consumers) identified
during the dissemination activities to redefine/improve features of the
product
34EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
− Organise testbeds with end users (public authorities, companies in water
treatment, citizens)
o Describe how your results can feed back to policy-making and how they
contribute to the EU priorities
Example:Water treatment would contribute to higher quality of tap water at a
lesser cost with a better taste and the guarantee of a safer product (free of
viruses), thereby encouraging citizens to drink tap water instead of bottled
water, and reducing the impact on the environment, thereby contributing to the
green deal. We will reach out to the local authorities to raise their awareness and
get their support.
We will implement a mapping of stakeholders at the local governmental level.
For that we can rely on indicators as level of interest in water management but
also Go-to-market service from Horizon Results Booster.
We will create a white paper to be distributed to regional water authorities from
the region of A and B (where we intend to run the tests)
2. Involve potential end-users and stakeholders in your proposal.
If they are committed from early on, they may help guide your work towards specific
qualities and applications of your results. End-users could come from the regional,
national and international networks of consortium partners, or from the value chains
they operate in. They could be involved as partners in the project, or, throughout its
duration, as members of an advisory board or user group tasked with co-creating and
testing the results and providing feedback. In the case of policy recommendations, you
may want to approach policy-makers from a local/regional/national authorities, or
regulatory bodies in order to design your research project bearing in mind their needs.
3. Say how you expect the results of your project to be exploited/further
developed and give the main advantages of the new solution(s) you expect
to deliver.
The results could be, for example: a manual, test, model, new therapy, better product
or process, or an improved understanding of mechanisms and advantages for reduced
material or energy use, improved safety, or better-trained staff.
Explain how you expect the results like these to be exploited. This could also depend on
progress elsewhere in the innovation chain, in related projects or in adjacent fields - so
outline these dependencies and any progress to be made in these areas.
4. Link your proposal to the policy context of the call for proposals.
Think of how your project results will contribute to the outcomes specified in the calls
and topics and how they are linked to a wider impact in the longer term, specified in the
respective destinations of the work programme. Consider the following questions:
• What are the objectives of your project?
• Why and how they can be important in view of the work programme?
• What target audience (user communities? Parts of the society?) would benefit?
• Is it clear how the effects of your project can contribute to the outcomes or
wider impact?
5. Implement open science practices
35EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Think of use, ownership and access rights.
Open science practices are addressed and evaluated under ‘excellence’ as they are
considered a part of the methodology. However, open access in particular also results in
the broad dissemination of knowledge and is relevant in the context of dissemination.
Providing open access to peer-reviewed publications is mandatory in Horizon Europe,
when peer-reviewed publications are produced. Open access to generated research data
is required under the premise ‘as open as possible as closed as necessary’, meaning
that there can be exceptions to this. Data management plans are mandatory for all
projects generating or reusing data. Additionally, we recommend that you provide open
access to research outputs beyond publications and data and share them as early and
openly as possible.
Please consult the relevant sections under ‘open science’ for guidance on all of the
above and the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement for further guidance regarding the
requirements.
6. Show you understand the barriers to any exploitation of your results.
How will you tackle them?
Possible obstacles may include:
• Inadequate financing
• Skills shortages
• Other R&I work within and beyond Horizon Europe
• Regulation that hinders innovation12
• Ontellectual property right issues
• Traditional value chains that are less keen to innovate
• Incompatibility between parts of systems (lack of standards)
• Mismatch between market needs and the solution
• User behaviour
Your proposal should show you understand these impediments and how you will tackle
them. You may involve in your project experts in economics, business, marketing and
public administration that could help to overcome barriers.
In order to enhance your dissemination and exploitation activities, e.g. to draft the
plan, improve and follow-up on D&E activities, you can apply to Horizon Results Booster
during and after project implementation. The Horizon Results Booster is a free of charge
expert service to help effectively disseminate and exploit research results. As soon as
you have identified key exploitable results in your project, you can publish a profile of
your result(s) in Horizon Results Platform to promote the results, accelerate
matchmaking with potential investors, partners or other stakeholders of interest to you.
7. Think ahead. Once your research and innovation is complete, will you need
to take further steps to apply it in actual practice?
Examples of further steps: Standards to be agreed on, financing the testing and
prototyping, scaling up or production, promoting acceptance by consumers or other
12 See Innovation Principle, a tool to ensure that EU policies and legislation support innovation.
36EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
partners in a value chain. Policymakers may also establish follow-up steps to integrate
the results into policies.
You could also consider additional funding and support schemes for follow-up steps, e.g.
national programmes, EIC, Invest EU, Regional Funds, European Structural and
Investment Funds, Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), European IPR Helpdesk, Horizon
Results Platform, Horizon Results Booster, Dealflow and others.
The communication part
Since EU grants are financed by public funds, beneficiaries are generally expected to
actively engage in communication activities and to promote the projects.
Communication can be defined as: Taking strategic and targeted measures for
promoting the action itself and its results to a multitude of audiences, including the
media and the public, and possibly engaging in a two-way exchange.
Communication activities must already be part of the proposal and be described in the
draft Dissemination and exploitation plan including communication activities which is an
admissibility criterion.
A good communication plan should define clear objectives (adapted to various relevant
target audiences) and set out a description and timing for each activity.
With your communication activities you should draw the attention of general and
specialised audiences to the EU policy area addressed by the call.
Good communication:
• Starts at the outset of the action and continues throughout its entire lifetime.
• Is strategically planned and not just ad-hoc efforts.
• Identifies and sets clear communication objectives (e.g. have final and
intermediate communication aims been specified? What impact is intended?
What reaction or change is expected from the target audience?).
• Is targeted and adapted to audiences that go beyond the project's own
community, including the media and the public.
• Chooses relevant messages (e.g. how does the action's work relate to our
everyday lives? Why does the target audience need to know about the action?).
• Uses the right medium and means (e.g. working at the right level — local,
regional, national, EU-wide; using the right ways to communicate — one-way
exchange (website, press release, brochure, etc) or two-way exchange
(exhibition, school visit, internet debate, et.); where relevant, include measures
for public/societal engagement on issues related to the action).
• Is proportionate to the scale of the action.
Strategy for intellectual property management
Applicants must outline their strategy for the management of intellectual property (IP),
including intended protection measures (if relevant) and how these would be used to
support exploitation in the proposal (section on impact).
Particularly in the case of projects aimed at economic and societal exploitation, the
strategy for IP management must be commensurate with the desired outcomes and
impacts. Hence, a weakness or failure to submit such a strategy would also need to be
37EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
reflected in the proposal evaluation (scoring) with view to the ‘credibility’ of the
envisaged impact pathways.
Results ownership
1. What is the ownership of results?
The owner of results is the natural or legal entity that has generated the results.
Results are defined as any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as data,
know-how or information, whatever its form or nature, whether or not it can be
protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual property rights.
2. When do you have to address the ownership of your results?
The ownership of potential results should be addressed very early by the consortium
members when preparing the proposal.
3. Why does the results ownership matter?
Horizon Europe has the specific objective to strengthen the deployment and exploitation
of innovative solutions. This objective calls for transparency and clarity in terms of
results ownership.
The lack of clarity on the ownership of results can be one of the main obstacles for
exploitation and commercialisation, especially for SMEs. Clarity of results ownership is a
critical factor for attracting investors. Beneficiaries should also clarify their freedom to
operate without infringing on intellectual property owned by third parties that might
require specific action (e.g. licencing) to fully exploit the own intellectual property.
More practically speaking, it is important that potential future consortium members
decide on the ownership of results when drafting the proposal to simplify their lives as
beneficiaries. Indeed, beneficiaries must indicate the owner(s) of the results in the final
periodic report of the Horizon Europe project in the so called Results Ownership List. If
the ownership of results has not been carefully thought through at the proposal phase,
beneficiaries may face difficulties in filling in the Results Ownership List at the reporting
stage. Knowing that failure to fill in the Results Ownership List will block the submission
of the final periodic report and hence the payment, dedicating sufficient time on the
allocation of the ownership of results at the proposal phase will avoid hurdles at the end
of the project.
Standardisation
1. What is standardisation?
A standard is a document that sets the technical requirements of a product, service or
process and its use. Standards are adopted by recognised standardisation bodies (such
as ISO, CEN, CENELEC, ETSI, and many more). In these organisations, representatives
from industry, research, governments and civil society, discuss and agree on what
should be a standard. Once a standard is published, its use is normally voluntary but in
some cases certain specific standards can be made mandatory by law.
In other words, standards form a common language that allows researchers, people,
public institutions and industry to communicate, produce and commercialise products
and services in a harmonised manner. This is especially important in the European
single market.
2. Why is it important to consider standardisation when drafting a proposal?
Standards play an important role in the valorisation of research & innovation results:
38EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
They help researchers bring their innovation to the market and spread technological
advances by making their results transparent. In spreading the diffusion of new
technologies, standards provide both economic opportunities, facilitate realisation of
SDGs and give confidence to consumers that an innovative technology is safe.
They codify the technology requirements and inform both manufacturers and
consumers on what to expect.
They allow technologies and materials to be interoperable: since a standard provides
details on the use and content of a technology or a material, it is much easier to know
when and how it can be used in combination with other technologies.
In other words, by codifying information on the state of the art of a particular
technology, standards enable dissemination of knowledge (both within and outside the
relevant industry community). Moreover, standards bridge the gap between research
and products or services allowing the diffusion of the technology in the market and
increasing the probabilities of its take-up. Standardisation facilitates the deployment of
new technologies, interoperability between new products and services. Innovations can
more easily gain market acceptance and consumer trust if they comply with existing
standards for safety, quality, performance and sustainability.
If the project is relevant for standardisation it is advised for applicants to involve
standard development organisations in the consortium in order to facilitate the
valorisation of project results through standardisation.
What is meant by the Do No Significant Harm principle in the context of
Horizon Europe?
The Commission Communication on the European Green Deal13 introduced green oath
to ‘do no harm’. The ‘Do not Significant Harm’ (DNSH) principle has been further
specified in the EU Regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate
sustainable investments14, commonly defined as the ‘EU Taxonomy Regulation’. Six
environmental objectives are listed in Article 915 of the EU Taxonomy and Article 17
specifies what can constitute a ‘significant harm’ for these objectives:
1. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to climate change
mitigation if it leads to significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
2. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to climate change
adaptation if it leads to an increased adverse impact of the current climate and
the expected future climate, on the activity itself or on people, nature or assets;
3. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the sustainable
use and protection of water and marine resources if it is detrimental to the
good status or the good ecological potential of bodies of water, including surface
water and groundwater, or to the good environmental status of marine waters;
4. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the circular
economy, including waste prevention and recycling, if it leads to significant
13 COM (2019) 640, The European Green Deal.
14 The ‘EU Taxonomy Regulation’ refers to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework
to facilitate sustainable investment, by setting out a classification system (or ‘taxonomy’) for
environmentally sustainable economic activities.
15 Climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; sustainable and protection of water and marine
resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; protection and restoration
of biodiversity and ecosystems.
39EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
inefficiencies in the use of materials or in the direct or indirect use of natural
resources, or if it significantly increases the generation, incineration or disposal
of waste, or if the long-term disposal of waste may cause significant and long-
term environmental harm;
5. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to pollution
prevention and control if it leads to a significant increase in emissions of
pollutants into air, water or land;
6. An economic activity is considered to do significant harm to the protection and
restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems if it is significantly detrimental to
the good condition and resilience of ecosystems, or detrimental to the
conservation status of habitats and species, including those of EU interest.
References on the DNSH principle are included in the General Introduction of the
applicable Horizon Europe Work Programme (2021-2022 and 2023-2024) because of
their particular relevance for environmental outcomes and impacts.
At programming stage, the Horizon Europe work programme has been co-created to
support research and innovation activities that respect climate and environmental
priorities of the EU and cause no significant harm to them.
At project level, the reference to the DNSH principle in the Horizon Europe work
programme is included in the application form (proposal part B template) to offer
researchers the possibility to present the credential of their projects in relation to the
DNSH principle. Applicants can refer to the DNSH principle when presenting their
research methodology and the expected impacts of the project, to show that their
project will not carry out activities that make a significant harm to any of the six
environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation listed above.
However, evaluators will not score applications in relation to their compliance
with the DNSH principle unless explicitly stated in the work programme.
Open science in Horizon Europe
Open science is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of
knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the process. It has the potential
to increase the quality and efficiency of research and accelerate the advancement of
knowledge and innovation by sharing results, making them more reusable and
improving their reproducibility. It entails the involvement of all relevant knowledge
actors.
Horizon Europe moves beyond open access to open science for which it features
a comprehensive policy implemented from the proposal stage to project reporting. The
Horizon Europe Regulation sets the legal basis for the open science obligations and
incentives that apply to Horizon Europe beneficiaries. The AGA — Annotated Grant
Agreement provides guidance on how to comply with the open science obligations
required in the Model Grant Agreement. The present guide complements the
information provided in the Annotated Grant Agreement, with a particular
focus on the preparation of proposals.
40EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
In Horizon Europe, open science practices are considered in the evaluation of proposals,
under ‘Excellence’ and under the ‘Quality and efficiency of implementation’.16 There are
mandatory open science practices, which are required for all projects through the Model
Grant Agreement and/or through the work programme or call conditions, and
recommended practices (all open science practices that are not mandatory).
Recommended open science practices are incentivised through their the evaluation at
the proposal stage. Proposers should be aware of both mandatory and recommended
practices and integrate them into their proposals.
Open science practices include early and open sharing of research (for example
through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, or crowd-sourcing); research
output17 management; measures to ensure reproducibility of research outputs;
providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software,
models, algorithms, and workflows); participation in open peer-review; and involving all
relevant knowledge actors including citizens, civil society and end users in the co-
creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as citizen science).
These practices are explained and relevant resources provided in a separate section
further below (open science practices and resources).
Mandatory open science practices
• Some open science practices are mandatory for all beneficiaries per the grant
agreement. They concern:
o open access to scientific publications under the conditions required by the
grant agreement;
o responsible management of research data in line with the FAIR principles of
‘Findability’, ‘Accessibility’, ‘Interoperability’ and ‘Reusability’, notably
through the generalised use of data management plans, and open access to
research data under the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as
necessary’, under the conditions required by the grant agreement;
o information about the research outputs/tools/instruments needed to validate
the conclusions of scientific publications or to validate/re-use research data;
o digital or physical access to the results needed to validate the conclusions of
scientific publications, unless exceptions apply;
o in cases of public emergency, if requested by the granting authority,
immediate open access to all research outputs under open licenses or, if
exceptions apply, access under fair and reasonable conditions to legal
entities that need the research outputs to address the public emergency18.
These obligations are described in the Model Grant Agreement (Article 17) and detailed
guidelines on complying with them are provided in the Annotated Grant Agreement
(Article 17).
• Some open science practices are mandatory per specific work programmes or
call conditions, which may provide for additional obligations to adhere to open
science practices.
16 This does not apply to the ERC programme that does not include open science in the evaluation. It also
does not include EIC transition calls where open science practices are exceptionally evaluated under
‘impact’.
17 These are results generated by the action to which online access can be given in the form of scientific
publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such as software, algorithms, protocols
and electronic notebooks.
18 The additional provision on access in cases of public emergency does not apply to the ERC.
41EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Recommended open science practices
These are open science practices beyond the mandatory ones, such as involving all
relevant knowledge actors, including citizens, early and open sharing of research,
output management beyond research data, open peer-review. This is a non-exhaustive
list of practices that proposers are expected to adopt when possible and appropriate for
their projects. Finally, certain work programme topics or call conditions may encourage
specific additional open science practices.
Evaluation of open science practices
Open science practices are evaluated under the ‘Excellence’ criterion (in particular
under methodology) and under the ‘Quality and efficiency of implementation’
award criterion. Proposers should address open science practices in the relevant section
on open science under methodology19.
Proposers will have to provide concrete information on how they plan to comply with
the mandatory open science practices. Failure to sufficiently address this, will result
in a lower evaluation score.
A clear explanation of how they will adopt recommended practices, as appropriate for
their projects, will result in a higher evaluation score.
If proposers believe that none of the open science practices (mandatory or
recommended) apply to their project, then they have to provide a justification.
Under the ‘Excellence’ part of their proposals, in the section on methodology,
proposers should describe how open science practices (mandatory and recommended,
as appropriate) are implemented as an integral part of the methodology and show how
their implementation is adapted to the nature of their work, therefore increasing the
chances of the project delivering on its objectives. Information relevant to the specific
area of the proposal should be provided in no more than one page. If open science
practices are not applicable to the proposal, justifications should be provided sp that, if
evaluators agree, open science will not be taken into consideration in the evaluation.
Additionally, proposers generating or reusing data should outline in a maximum of one
(additional) page their plans for data management.
Under ‘Capacity of participants and consortium as a whole’, proposers should
describe how the consortium brings together the necessary disciplinary and inter-
disciplinary knowledge. Proposers should show how this includes expertise and/or track
record in open science practices, relevant to what is planned for the project. If
justification has been provided that open science practices are not relevant for their
projects, it is not necessary to demonstrate track record and expertise.
Finally, in Part A of their proposals, proposers are asked to list up to five relevant
publications, widely used datasets or other achievements of consortium members that
they consider significant for the action proposed. Open access is expected for
publications, in particular journal articles, while datasets are expected to be FAIR and
‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. If publications are not open access,
proposers are strongly encouraged to deposit them retroactively in repositories and
provide open access to them when possible. The significance of publications will not be
evaluated on the basis of the Journal Impact Factor of the venue they are published in,
but on the basis of a qualitative assessment provided by the proposers for each
publication.
19 The information in this section does not apply to the ERC programme, which does not include open
science in the evaluation.
42EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
How should you address open science practices in your proposal?
Make sure to read the Annotated Grant Agreement on the mandatory open science
practices in combination with this guide20.
Early and open sharing: Provide specific information on whether and how you will
implement early and open sharing and for which part of your expected output. For
example, you may mention what type of early and open sharing is appropriate for your
discipline and project, such as preprints or preregistration/registration reports, and
which platforms you plan to use.
Research data management (RDM): RDM is mandatory in Horizon Europe for
projects generating or reusing data. If you expect to generate or reuse data and/or
other research outputs (except for publications), you are required to outline in a
maximum of one page how these will be managed. Further details on this are provided
in the proposal template in the relevant section on open science. A full data
management plan (DMP) is not required at submission stage. For those work
programmes that require the use of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)
federated repositories, proposers should explicitly discuss the use of such repositories in
their proposals. By exception, in cases of a public emergency and if the work
programme requires so, you should submit a full DMP already with submission of
proposals or at the latest by the signature of the grant agreement. A template for a
DMP is provided under the reporting templates in the Funding & Tenders Portal
Reference Documents page.
Reproducibility of research outputs: you should outline the measures planned in the
project that tend to increase reproducibility. Such measures may already be
interweaved in other parts of the methodology of a proposal (such as transparent
research design, the robustness of statistical analyses, addressing negative results, etc)
or in mandatory/non-mandatory open science practices (e.g. the DMP, early sharing
through preregistration and preprints, open access to software, workflows, tools, etc) to
be implemented. More detailed suggestions on good practices for enhancing
reproducibility and resources in the relevant section below.
Horizon Europe requires information via the repository where publications and data
have been deposited on any research output or any other tools and instruments - data,
software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows, electronic notebooks and others -
needed for the re-use or validation of the conclusions of scientific publications and the
validation and reuse of research data. Further, beneficiaries must provide digital or
physical access to data or other results needed for the validation of the conclusions of
scientific publications, to the extent that their legitimate interests or constraints are
safeguarded21. More details on these requirements for reproducibility and guidance on
how to meet them are provided in the AGA (article 17).
Open access: Offer specific information on how you will meet the open access
requirements, that is deposition and immediate open access to publications and open
access to data (the latter with some exceptions and within the deadlines set in the
DMP) through a trusted repository, and under open licenses. You may elaborate on the
(subscription-based or open access) publishing venues that you will use. You may also
elaborate on the trusted repository/repositories through which open access to
publications and research data will be provided (article 17). Open access to research
data and other research outputs should be addressed in the section on research data
management of your proposal. Research data should be open as a default, unless there

43EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
are legitimate reasons for keeping them closed. On open access to data and the
legitimate reasons for restricting access, consult the AGA (article 17).
As a general rule, open access to other research outputs such as software, models,
algorithms, workflows, protocols, simulations, electronic notebooks and others is not
required but strongly recommended. Access to ‘physical’ results like cell lines,
biospecimens, compounds, materials, etc. is also strongly encouraged.
Open peer review: Anytime it is possible, you are invited to prefer open peer review
for your publications over traditional (‘blind’ or ‘closed’) peer review. When the case,
you should provide specific information regarding the publishing venues you envisage to
make use of, and highlight the venues that would qualify as providing open peer review.
Citizen, civil society and end-user engagement: Provide clear and succinct
information on how citizen, civil society and end-user engagement will be implemented
in your project, where/if appropriate. The kinds of engagement activities will depend on
the type of R&I activity envisaged and on the disciplines and sectors implicated.
This may include: co-design activities (such as workshops, focus groups or other means
to develop R&I agendas, roadmaps and policies) often including deep discussion on the
implications, the ethics, the benefits and the challenges related to R&I courses of action
or technology development; co-creation activities (involving citizens and/or end-users
directly in the development of new knowledge or innovation, for instance through
citizen science and user-led innovation); and co-assessment activities (such as assisting
in the monitoring, evaluation and feedback to governance of a project, projects, policies
or programmes on an iterative or even continual basis).
The extent of engagement in the proposal could range from one-off activities alongside
other methodological approaches to being the primary focus or methodological
approach of the project itself. Engagement will require resources and expertise and is
therefore often conducted by dedicated interlocutor organisations or staff with relevant
expertise. More detailed information on these activities and useful resources developed
over the course of Horizon 2020 can be found in the relevant section below.
Open science practices and relevant resources
Early and open sharing of research
‘Early and open sharing’ means making research work, methodologies, outputs, such as
data and software, among others, and findings available as soon as possible in the
research process. Examples of such early sharing include preregistration, registered
reports and pre-prints. Early-sharing practices support reproducibility in the research
and helps researchers secure precedence over their findings and/or conclusions.
Preregistration of the research plan in a public repository makes available the
research hypothesis, study design and planned analysis before data is collected.
Preregistration is assisted by dedicated platforms; it increases the transparency,
credibility and reproducibility of the results and helps addressing publication bias toward
positive findings.
Registered reports are research articles that are peer-reviewed and published in two
stages. The study design and analysis plan including hypothesis and methodology
undergo peer-review of the quality and suitability of the research question and protocol.
If accepted, research protocols are preregistered (see preregistration) and the final
research article is provisionally accepted for publication. After the research is
conducted, an article containing the results and discussion as well as any changes is
submitted and undergoes a second round of peer-reviewing. Registered reports reduce
publishing bias for positive results as the acceptance for publication is based on the
quality of the research, regardless of the outcome.
44EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Preprints are scientific manuscripts that are publicly shared prior to peer-review and
journal publication via preprint platforms. An increasing number of journals accepts
sharing of preprints prior to publication, but there are exceptions. Beneficiaries have to
check the policy of their target journal to clear that a preprint will not pre-empt its
publication.

Research data management and management of other research outputs
Research data management (RDM) is the process within the research lifecycle that
includes the data collection or acquisition, organisation, curation, storage, (long-term)
preservation, security, quality assurance, allocation of persistent identifiers (PIDs),
provision of metadata in line with disciplinary requirements, licencing, and rules and
procedures for sharing of data. RDM is an essential element in any project that
generates, collects or re-uses data. Planning ahead to data needs that proposers are
45EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
likely to encounter during the project is a best practice. For example, provisions need to
be in place to ensure that data is managed responsibly (e.g. the right venue is chosen
for deposition, adequate are issued, legal provisions such as General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) are respected, etc). Further, data management should be in line
with the FAIR principles22, to ensure that researchers can find, access and re-use each
other’s data, maximising the effectiveness and reproducibility of the research
undertaken.
RDM, in line with the FAIR principles is a requirement that should be carried out
regardless of whether the data generated and re-used in the project is intended to be
openly accessible, or if access restrictions are foreseen. FAIR data is not equivalent to
open data (publicly available to everyone to access and reuse). Data can, and should be
FAIR even when access is restricted.
RDM and the FAIR principles can be applied to research outputs other than data (i.e.
workflows, protocols, software, samples, etc). Proposers are recommended to consider
robust management practices for data and other research outputs as early as the
proposal stage of their project.
Below are important elements and resources for RDM useful already at proposal stage.
Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are key in ensuring the findability of research outputs,
including data. They are globally unique and long-lasting references to digital objects
(such as data, publications and other research outputs) or non-digital objects such as
researchers, research institutions, grants, etc. Frequently used persistent identifiers
include digital object identifiers (DOIs), Handles, and others. For further reading on PID
types, please refer to https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/technical-solutions-and-
tools/persistent-identifiers.
To enhance the findability of research outputs, and their potential reuse, standardised
metadata frameworks are essential, ensuring that data and other research outputs
are accompanied by rich metadata that provides them with context.
To enhance the re-usability of research data, they must be licenced. For more
information on the licences required for data under Horizon Europe, please refer to the
AGA (article 17).
Trusted repositories assume a central role in the Horizon Europe for the deposition of
and access to publications and research data. For a definition of trusted repositories in
Horizon Europe please refer to the AGA (article 17). Proposers, with the help of data
and research support staff (e.g. data stewards, data librarians, etc), should check
whether the repositories that they plan to deposit their data have the features of
trusted repositories, and justify this accordingly in their Data Management Plans.
Data management plans (DMPs) are a cornerstone for responsible management of
research outputs, notably data and are mandatory in Horizon Europe for projects
generating and/or reusing data (on requirements and the frequency of DMPs as
deliverables consult the AGA article 17). A template for a DMP is provided under the
reporting templates available on the Funding & Tenders Portal Reference documents
page. Its use is recommended but not mandatory. DMPs are formal documents that
outline from the start of the project all aspects of the research data lifecycle, which
includes its organisation and curation, and adequate provisions for its access,
preservation, sharing, and eventual deletion, both during and after a project. Writing a
DMP is part of the methodology of the project, since good data management makes the
work more efficient, saves time, contributes to safeguarding information and to
22 FAIR data are data that are curated to satisfy the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability,
and reusability. For further reading: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/
46EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
increasing the value of the data among the beneficiaries themselves and others, during
and after the research. DMPs are thus a key means of support when planning and
conducting a research project, and, ideally, filling in a DMP should be started prior to
the beginning of the project.
DMPs play a key role in helping researchers to adequately manage research outputs
other than data and publications, also in line with the FAIR principles. Such research
outputs may be physical or digital, and include original software created during the
project, workflows, protocols, new materials such as samples, cell-lines, antibodies,
among many others. DMPs should reflect an adequate management strategy for such
outputs as well.
A DMP should be a living document, which is updated and enriched as the project
evolves. Such updates might occur after attaining milestones related e.g. to the
generation of new data or to reflect changes related to the original planning, changes in
data/output access provisions or curation policies, changes in consortium practices (e.g.
new innovation potential, decision to file for a patent), changes in consortium
composition, etc.
A good practice regarding DMPs is to register them as a non-restricted public
deliverables to make them openly accessible, unless legitimate reasons exist to keep
them confidential. An additional good practice is to publish the DMP in specialised
journals or publishing platforms such as RIO etc., or to deposit them in DMP-specific
public repositories such as DMPOnline and others.
As practices with regard to data management, storage, and sharing differ widely across
disciplines, the DMPs should reflect common disciplinary practices. In addition to
domain specificities, DMPs across the board should address an overarching set of data-
related requirements including those aspects related to making the data FAIR. Common
aspects that need to be addressed in all DMPs include23:
• Data set description: a sufficiently detailed description of the data generated
or re-used, including the scientific focus and technical approach to allow
association of their data sets with specific research as well as information on
data types and an estimate of the data set’s size.
• Standards and metadata: the protocols and standards used to structure the
data (i.e. fully reference the metadata) so that other scientists can make an
assessment and reproduce the dataset. If available, a reference to the
community data standards with which their data conform and that make them
interoperable with other data sets of similar type.
• Name and persistent identifier for the data-sets: a unique and persistent
identification (an identifier) of the data sets and a stable resolvable link to where
the data sets can be directly accessed. Submission to a public repository
normally provides this; many institutional repositories provide similar services.
• Curation and preservation methodology: information on the standards that
will be used to ensure the integrity of the data sets and the period during which
they will be maintained, as well as how they will be preserved and kept
accessible in the longer term. A reference to the public data repository in which
the data will be/is deposited with relevant consideration on whether the chosen
repository meets the requirements of a trusted repository.
23 These aspects are broadly in line with the requirements set forth in Science Europe’s Practical Guide to
the International Alignment of Research Data Management:
https://www.scienceeurope.org/media/4brkxxe5/se_rdm_practical_guide_extended_final.pdf
47EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Data sharing methodology: information on how the data sets can be
accessed, including the terms-of-use or the license under which they can be
accessed and re-used, and information on any restrictions that may apply or
relevant security and privacy considerations. It is also important to specify and
justify the timing of data sharing. On open access to research data see below
relevant section on open access.
• Output management, for research outputs other than data and
publications: The section on output management should show efforts to
manage outputs in line with the FAIR principles, including a detailed description
of the output, consider relevant metadata standards and the provision of PIDs
when depositing the output, or its digital representation if it is physical. The plan
should further detail the deposition, curation and preservation methodology
foreseen, identifying the right home for the output, and it should set out an
approach likely to maximise the re-use and adoption of the output by the wider
research community. If the output is physical, the plan should indicate how it
would be made available to potential users.
• Costs and personnel related to RDM: An estimation of costs related to RDM
such as costs for data collection, data documentation, data storage, data access
and security, data preservation, data availability and reuse as well as the
person/team responsible for data management and quality assurance processes.
The European Open Science Cloud
The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) aims to deploy and consolidate an open,
trusted virtual environment to enable circa 2 million European researchers to store,
share, process, analyse, and reuse research digital objects including data, publications
and software across disciplines and borders. A European co-programmed Partnership
approach for EOSC has been proposed for the period 2021-2030 (https://eosc.eu/). It
will bring together institutional, national and European initiatives and engage all
relevant stakeholders to deploy a European Research Data Commons where data are
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR). This European contribution to a
Web of FAIR Data and Related Services for Science will support open science in a
deepened European Research Area and provide the basis for the research and
innovation data space foreseen in the European Strategy for Data.
Certain work programmes may require the use of trusted repositories that are federated
in EOSC for depositing research data. In that case, data must be deposited in
repositories which are registered to the EOSC and support (implicitly or explicitly) the
FAIR principles. An initial offering of EOSC resources and services can be found from the
EOSC Portal. This offering is expected to continue growing in function of the EOSC rules
of participation.

Measures to ensure reproducibility of results
Reproducibility is the possibility for the scientific community to obtain the same results
as the originators of specific findings. Reproducibility of some or all results is important
as it increases the performance of research & innovation (wider use of research
results); it limits waste of resources (less duplication and fewer false baselines); it
increases the quality and the reliability of research (stronger methods, controls and
reporting); and, as a result, it may increase the trust of citizens in science. Therefore,
reproducibility is integral part of ‘Excellence’; we expect the results of Horizon Europe to
be reproducible, and planning should start at proposal stage to make results reusable
and reproducible.
Below is a list of practices which tend to increase reproducibility. Some of them may
already be required by the MGA (for example DMP, FAIR) or by specific calls and
proposers may interweave such practices in various parts of the methodology section as
appropriate:
• Specify with precision and no ambiguities the research design and the
methodologies that you will be applying.
• Specify how you will deal with negative results, if any, so that others can lean
from your project regarding of its outcomes.
• Make prior searches and checks on existing results and data to ensure you are
not duplicating unnecessarily.
• Specify how you are making use of pre-prints, preregistration of protocols and
registered reports (see above, ‘Early sharing of research results’), to ensure that
your method and research questions are accountable, if applicable.
• Detail the steps you will take to make your research process and tools (software,
materials, protocols, flows, ...) transparent and available during and after the
research.
• Mention the steps, if any, that you will take to ensure the validity and the quality
of the project’s process and results (e.g. peer review, knowledge sharing,
independent testing, supervision, quality control mechanisms).
49EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
• Plan to use the DMP to the full extent possible to detail the assets and materials
underlying your data collection and analysis (see above, ‘DMP’).
• Ensure that your data are FAIR so that others can find them and re-use them to
reproduce your results (see above, ‘FAIR’).
• Specify how you will ensure robust statistical analysis, that can be repeated
(power of sample, robust experimental techniques, open software, ...).
• Specify what ‘common assets’ for research & innovation your project will be
building, if any, including knowledge bases, methodologies, evaluation
frameworks, ontologies, open repositories, etc.
• Make provisions to validate, demonstrate, make interoperable, scale-up and
overall make replicable the results of your R&I activities.
• Consider whether your project will produce digital copies of your results, e.g.
Digital Twins, virtual bodies, digital blueprints, that increase the likelihood of re-
use and reproducibility.
Reference documents and further reading
• An extensive list of resources is provided by the Centre for open science
• Information and resources provided by networks focusing on reproducibility, for
example in the UK, Germany, Switzerland
• Guidelines and toolkits on reproducibility, especially specific to your field (e.g. in
biomedical research).
Open access to research outputs
Open access is online access at no cost for the end user of research outputs such as
scientific publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes (e.g. software,
models, algorithms, protocols and electronic notebooks). Open access often carries less
restrictive copyright and licensing barriers than traditionally published works, for both
the users and the authors.
Open access enables increased quality and efficiency of research and accelerates the
advancement of knowledge and innovation by making results reusable and by
improving their reproducibility. It also offers the means for more creativity, more trust
in science and greater impacts by building on collective intelligence, facilitating cross-
disciplinary research and involvement of all relevant knowledge actors, including
citizens.
Horizon Europe requires deposition of scientific peer-reviewed publications and research
data and open access (with exceptions for research data) following specific
requirements. For guidance on this consult the AGA (article 17).
While it is not mandatory to publish (if a project intends to exploit its results, it may
decide not to publish), if scientific peer-reviewed publications are produced then
they must be open access immediately at publication time under open licenses (such as
Creative Commons), providing specific minimum sets of rights of reuse (CC BY for
articles and book chapters in edited books and CC BY, CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-
ND or equivalent for long-text formats. The following checklist shows what users can do

It is important to be aware that Horizon Europe requires that enough intellectual
property rights are maintained by beneficiaries or authors to ensure the required open
access to scientific publications.
Proposers should be aware that beneficiaries are required to retain sufficient intellectual
property rights (IPR) to comply with their open access obligations. Authors may need to
interact with prospective publishers, in particular when they publish in venues that are
not open access. To facilitate compliance with their open access obligations,
beneficiaries/researchers are encouraged to notify publishers of their grant agreement
obligations (including the licensing requirements) already at manuscript submission. For
example, by adding the following statement to their manuscript: “This work was funded
by the Εuropean Union under the Horizon Europe grant [grant number]. As set out in
the Grant Agreement, beneficiaries must ensure that at the latest at the time of
publication, open access is provided via a trusted repository to the published version or
the final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication under the latest available
version of the Creative Commons Attribution International Public Licence (CC BY) or a
licence with equivalent rights. CC BY-NC, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-ND or equivalent
licenses could be applied to long-text formats.” If the publishing agreement is contrary
to the grant agreement obligations, authors should negotiate its terms and,
alternatively, look for a different publishing venue/options.
Data should be deposited in a trusted repository as soon as possible after data
production and at the latest by the end of the project. Data underpinning a scientific
publication should be deposited at the latest at the time of publication and in line with
standard community practices. Beneficiaries of Horizon Europe have to ensure open
access to research data generated in their projects under the principle ‘as open as
possible and as closed as necessary’. This means that data is in principle open, unless
beneficiaries decide to restrict access to some or all their research data for legitimate
51EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
reasons. On open access to data and the legitimate reasons for restricting access
consult the AGA (article 17) and section above on research data management.
Open access to other research outputs, such as software, workflows and others, will
ensure that these outputs that have been generated by Horizon Europe actions are also
freely accessible to all. This will promote transparency, efficiency and reproducibility, as
well as trust in science, and will facilitate access for citizens. Proposers/beneficiaries are
also encouraged to license research outputs other than publications and data under
appropriate licenses. With regard to software, it should be noted that with the exception
of CC0 (i.e. public domain dedication) CC licenses are not appropriate (although they
can be used for software documentation). Instead, the use of appropriate software
licenses, such as those listed as free by the Free Software Foundation and listed as
open source by the Open Source Initiative, is strongly recommended.

Publishing using open peer-review
Open peer review is an umbrella term for various alternative review methods that seek
to make classical peer review more transparent and accountable. It has neither a
standardised definition, nor an agreed schema of its features and implementations.
Open peer review refers to a peer review process that contains one or more of these
elements24:
• Authors and reviewers are aware of each other’s identity during or after the
review process.
• Review reports are published alongside the relevant article.
• The wider community is able to contribute to the review process (peer
researcher or even general public).
• Manuscripts are made immediately available in advance of the formal peer
review procedure.
• Review or commenting on the final ‘version of record’ is made possible.
• Direct, reciprocal discussion between authors and reviewers and/or between
reviewers is allowed and encouraged.
• Review can be decoupled from publishing when facilitated by a different
organisational entity than the venue of publication (e.g. publishing platforms).
Some journals and scholarly publishers apply open peer review. Some platforms,
including preprint servers, may also facilitate open peer review of preprints. For
example, Open Research Europe, the open access publishing platform of the European
Commission uses the open peer review model, where both names of authors and
reviewers are public, and the review report is open access.
Open peer review is an important aspect of open science. Opening up what has
traditionally been a closed process increases opportunities to spot errors, validate
findings and to increase the overall trust in published outputs. Open peer-review is
considered by some among the measures that increase the quality of the peer review
process (by making it more constructive), and the transparency of research (with
'openness' applying to all processes in the scientific workflow). Another argument to
engage in open peer review is that it ensures reviewers to get credit for their efforts.

FOSTER proposes a module to learn basics on open peer review
(https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/learning/open-peer-review)
Open Research Europe (https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu) supports open
peer review in all scientific fields for all Horizon Europe publications.
Some discipline-specific venues support open peer review and are suitable for the life
sciences (e.g. eLIFE, Bio Med Central, BMJ, GIGA science and BioRxiv, ASAPbio), the
social sciences (e.g. SAGE open, Wiley and SocArXiv) and the arts and humanities
(SAGE open, Wiley and digitalculturebooks).
Citizen, civil society and end-user engagement
Citizen and civil society engagement is a programme principle and operational objective
that refers to the opening up of R&I processes to society to develop better, more
innovative and more relevant outcomes, and to increase societal trust in the processes
and outcomes of R&I.
Opening up the R&I system towards society and supporting citizens, civil society and
end-users to participate in R&I – as sources of ideas, knowledge and/or data, as data
collectors and/or analysers, and/or as testers and/or end users – enlarges the collective
intelligence, capabilities and scope of the R&I and is likely to lead to greater creativity
and robustness of the outcomes and reduced time-to-market of the innovative products
and services. It also increases the relevance and responsiveness of R&I, ensuring that
its outcomes align with the needs, expectations and values of society. Moreover, it is a
key element for improving the transparency, co-ownership and trust of society in the
process and outcomes of R&I. Conducting R&I openly, responsibly, transparently, and in
adherence to the highest standards of research integrity and ethics is also important for
responding to increased science denial.
Engagement can range from the identification and conceptualisation of R&I priorities
(e.g. through deliberative or other participatory processes), to the implementation,
utilisation and assessment of R&I results (e.g. through data collection, data analysis,
discussion and publication or presenting scientific results, working in fab-labs to develop
new innovations, testing innovations and solutions, and evidence-based advocacy).
The following are activities that proposers may consider including in their proposal:
Co-design activities could involve workshops, focus groups or other means to develop
R&I agendas, roadmaps or policies. These could be one-off activities in one or several
different localities or repeated consultations with the same or varying groups. They
could involve citizens and/or one or many organisation types at the same time. Co-
design activities often include deep discussion on the implications, the ethics, the
benefits and the challenges related to R&I courses of action or technology development.
Co-design could be the overall focus of a project (e.g. to develop a roadmap for a
certain technology), a Work Package within a project that uses the outcomes of the co-
design in subsequent Work Packages, or a supporting Work Package that provides
continual feedback on project activities throughout the project cycle.
Co-creation activities, such as citizen science or user-led innovation, involve citizens or
end-users directly in the development of new knowledge or innovations, through a
range of different levels of participation. These could include identifying R&I questions
to be tackled by the project, developing a methodology, observing, gathering and
processing data, right up to the publication and presentation of results. The co-creation
activities could be the focus of a proposal, or could be one of the methodological
approaches taken alongside others.
54EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Co-assessment activities, such as assisting in the monitoring and evaluation of the
progress of the project, portfolio of projects, policies or programmes, help ensure an
iterative or even continual process of interaction with citizens, civil society and end-
users throughout the project cycle on the quality, utilisation and (potential) impact of
project outputs.
In certain cases, citizens, civil society and end-users may be involved across different
stages of the R&I and/or policy cycle, by deciding on the research to be conducted,
conducting that research, analysing and interpreting the data, and engaging in related
advocacy or policy activities.
An important aspect to consider in many cases is the inclusivity of the engagement and
ensuring diversity of participation. The challenge of sustaining engagement should not
be underestimated and different forms of compensation or rewards could be considered,
as well as measures for two-way learning between scientists or innovators and the co-
creators.
Engagement requires resources and expertise. Often, engagement is conducted by
dedicated interlocutor organisations that already have the reach, trust, and expertise to
successfully carry out the engagement exercises. The integration of the engagement
activities, and their outcomes within the project design, should aim to ensure use of the
outcomes (i.e. they are not ‘window dressing’ or unimportant side-activities), and that
there is appropriate feedback and acknowledgement to the engaged. If the call
conditions allow it, the launch of calls for small grants or prizes can be useful (or in
some other cases even essential) for reaching and engaging local communities and
small associations, civil society organisations, social enterprises, or small businesses.
Generally, the greater the interaction from across the quadruple helix (academia-
industry-government-civil), the more the R&I results will be reliable, trusted and taken
up by society. Different organisation types, and different societal perspectives, help
ensure that the processes and the outcomes of the R&I align with the needs, values and
expectations of society. In many cases, the body of knowledge and practice built up in
Horizon 2020 on Responsible Research and Innovation will be relevant.
Co-design, co-creation, and co-assessment, as (sometimes) radical departures from
more traditional forms of R&I, could imply changes to the institutional governance of
the participating beneficiaries that last beyond the lifetime of project funding.
Terminology:
• ‘Citizens’ should be understood as individuals acting on their own initiative and
not on behalf of their employer or sectoral interests. It does not refer to any
legal citizenship(s) that people may or may not hold.
• ‘Civil society’ refers to the ensemble of citizens and civil society organisations
that are active in the public sphere but distinct from government and business.
• ‘Civil society organisations (CSOs)’ include all non-state, not-for-profit
structures, such as citizens’ associations, patient groups, professional societies
or groups, consumer groups, humanitarian organisations, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs), foundations and charities.
• ‘End-users’ are public, private or civil (i.e. civil society, see above) organisations
that constitute potential users of the R&I outputs.
• ‘Engagement’ means the involvement of citizens and civil society in co-designing
R&I agendas, in co-creating R&I contents, and/or in co-assessing R&I outcomes.

What is innovation procurement and how is it relevant for Horizon Europe?
Innovation procurement happens when public procurement is used to drive innovation
from the demand side. This enables the public sector to speed up the development and
adoption of innovative solutions that can improve the quality and efficiency of public
services or address wider societal challenges while opening concrete business
opportunities for companies in Europe to bring innovations to the market.
Innovation procurement is therefore a topic of cross-cutting importance for all
pillars of the Horizon Europe programme:
• Under the Excellence Science pillar, innovation procurement can help increase
the EU’s global scientific competitiveness in the field of research infrastructures.
In the field of supercomputing for example, innovation procurement actions
financed under FP7 and Horizon 2020 have paved the way for stronger European
cooperation and competitiveness through the joint undertaking for High
Performance Computing (HPC).
• Under the Global Challenges and European Industrial Competiveness pillar
innovation procurement can trigger new research and development (R&D) and
deployment of innovative solutions to address societal challenges (e.g. in health,
security, energy, environment, transport…) and reinforce technological and
industrial capacities. For EU-missions, innovation procurement can also play a
key role to bring to the market solutions that can tackle big problems. This
online brochure bundles examples of innovation procurement funded by the EU
research and innovation programme that successfully tackled societal challenges
in several sectors.
• Under the Innovative Europe pillar, innovation procurement links to SME support
via the European Innovation Council.
Finally, innovation procurement is also central to the European Defence Fund and may
also be used in the context of the Euratom Programme.
What is the strategic importance for Europe?
Benchmarking shows that in Europe investments on innovation procurement are 2
times lower compared to other leading global economies. Underinvestment is the
biggest in R&D procurement (5 times lower) and in adoption of ICT based solutions (3
times lower). As innovation procurement is crucial for public sector modernisation and
56EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
business growth, mainstreaming innovation procurement is of strategic
importance to strenghten Europe’s global competitiveness. By closing the gap
between supply and demand in a way that reinforces EU strategic autonomy, innovation
procurement can make a key contribution to economic recovery25. It can increase
resilience in the supply chain by opening up opportunities for innovative companies,
including also SMEs and Startups, to access the public procurement market, attract
financial investment and scale up their business.
How does Horizon Europe support innovation procurement?
Horizon Europe provides EU funding to start innovation procurement. A key difference
to other research and innovation actions is that funding for innovation procurement is
not targeted at potential ‘providers’ but at potential ‘buyers’ of innovative solutions:
public procurers, possibly in cooperation with private and NGO buyers.
Two complementary types of innovation procurement are supported:
• Public Procurement of Innovative solutions (PPI) can be used by procurers
when challenges of public interest can be addressed by innovative solutions that
are nearly or already in small quantities on the market. PPI can thus be used
when there is no need for procurement of new R&D to bring solutions to the
market, but as a clear signal from a sizeable amount of early adopters/launch
customers that they are willing to purchase/deploy the innovative solutions if
those can be delivered with the desired quality and price by a specific moment in
time. PPI may still involve conformance testing before deployment.
• Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) can be used by procurers when there
are no near-to-the-market solutions that meet all the procurers' requirements
and new R&D is needed to get new solutions developed and tested to address
the procurement need. PCP can then compare the pros and cons of alternative
approaches to address the challenge and eliminate risk from promising
innovations step-by-step via solution design, prototyping, development and first
product testing. PCP is a public procurement of R&D services that does not
include the deployment of commercial volumes of end-products (see PPI for the
latter).
In several areas, there is a need for European cross-border cooperation on innovation
procurement to address challenges that require cross-border interoperability or
interconnection, to pool resources for problems that cannot be financed from only
national funding, to obtain higher quality and lower cost solutions and to reduce
fragmentation of demand so that companies can sell their solutions to a wide European
market.
Therefore, Horizon Europe provides different types of support for buyers from
different countries that want to collaborate together on innovation procurement:
• Coordination and Support actions (CSA) support coordination and
networking activities for groups of procurers to investigate the feasibility and/or
prepare the ground for concrete future innovation procurement. CSA grants do
not provide EU co-financing for a procurement action.
• PCP or PPI actions co-finance both the procurement cost for groups of
procurers to buy the research, development, validation and possible first
25 Impacts of EU funded PCP show 20%-30% efficiency and quality improvements in public services,
doubling of the amount of public procurement directly awarded to startups/SMEs, a factor 20 increase in
the amount of cross-border contract award to startups/SMEs and a factor 4 additional financing secured
by startups/SMEs. The use of place of performance and IPR/commercialisation conditions that fuel
commercialisation in Europe, also contributes to EU strategic autonomy.
57EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
deployment (PCP) or wider scale deployment (PPI) of innovative solutions as well
as additional related costs to prepare, manage and follow up such procurement.
A minimum of two public procurers from two different EU Member States or
associated countries are required in the buyers’ group. One of them will act as
lead procurer to coordinate and lead one joint PCP or PPI action or several
separate but coordinated PPI actions for the buyers’ group. In addition other
procurers, e.g. private procurers or NGO procurers, can be part of the buyers’
group. Both in PCP actions, PPI actions and CSAs that prepare PCP or PPI
procurements, other entities (e.g. experts, certification bodies) can also
participate in the additional activities of the action, except entities that are
potential suppliers of solutions for the procurement action or have another
potential conflict of interest with the procurement action. In total there must be
minimum three participants from three different Member States or countries
associated to Horizon Europe in the action. Entities formed by several public
procurers from different countries can also apply for this type of funding (e.g.
European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation- EGTCs, European Research
Infrastructure Consortia – ERICs, Central Purchasing Bodies, etc).
For more information about the CSA and PCP and PPI action instruments, refer to
General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme.
The EU itself can also implement innovation procurement from the Horizon Europe
budget, either alone or together with public buyers from Member States. An example
funded by Horizon Europe is the EU blockchain PCP implemented by the European
Commission.
It is also possible for one single buyer to implement PCP and PPI actions on its own,
under the subcontracting activities of a regular research and innovation grant.
Examples of projects and achievable impacts?
Examples of ongoing PCP and PPI projects funded by previous FP7 and CIP programs
can be found here. Showcase success stories are bundled here. More information about
the impacts achieved by past projects is also available here.
How to find and apply for relevant calls?
If you are a public buyer and you are looking for an overview of all actions that support
innovation procurement, you can search all calls on the Funding and Tenders portal via
the keywords ‘innovation/innovative procurement’, ‘PCP’, ‘PPI’.
Where to find support to prepare a proposal?
Looking for partners? Participate in info days and EU events on innovation
procurement in preparation of calls for proposals. Get connected with other procurers
and experts from around Europe that are interested and active on innovation
procurement via the LinkedIn Group on Innovation Procurement.
National Contact Points (NCPs) in every Member State offer information and guidance in
your own language on how to apply for Horizon Europe funding and may help with
partner search.
Check if there is an innovation procurement competence/support center in your country
where you could find information and support. This European network of national
innovation procurement competence centers can be a starting point.
Is my organisation a public procurer?
58EU Grants: HE Programme Guide: V4.1 – 01.05.2024
Public procurers are organisations that are contracting authorities or contracting
entities according to the definition of those terms in the EU Public Procurement
Directives 2014/24/EU, 2004/25/EU, 2009/81/EC.
‘Contracting authority’ means the State, regional or local authorities, bodies
governed by public law, associations formed by one or several of such authorities or
one or several of such bodies governed by public law (for the full definition, see Article
2(1)(1) of Directive 2014/24/EU). Bodies governed by public law also include entities
financed mostly by the State, regional or local authorities, or other bodies governed by
public law and entities controlled by those bodies (for the full definition, see Article
2(1)(4) of Directive 2014/24/EU). This includes for example ministries, regions, cities,
road management authorities, public hospitals, central purchasing bodies etc.
‘Contracting entities’ refers to entities operating in specific sectors (such as utilities
for water, energy, transport, postal services covered by Directive 2014/25/EU and
contracting entities in the field of security covered by Directive 2009/81/EC). They may
be contracting authorities, public undertakings or entities operating on the basis of
special or exclusive rights (for the full definition, see Article 4 of Directive 2014/25/EU).
Under Horizon Europe, public procurers also include entities that are contracting
authorities/entities according to the above definition but to which the EU Public
Procurement Directives itself do not apply (e.g. international organisations such as
ERICs - European Research Infrastructure Consortia).

Due diligence is required regarding the trustworthiness of all artificial intelligence-based
systems or techniques used or developed in projects funded under the Horizon Europe
Programme. Wherever appropriate, AI-based systems or techniques must be developed
in a safe, secure and responsible manner, with a clear identification of and preventative
approach to risks.
To a degree matching the type of research being proposed (from basic to
precompetitive) and as appropriate, AI-based systems or techniques should be, or be
developed to become (implicitly or explicitly contributing to one or several of the
following objectives):
• technically robust, accurate and reproducible, and able to deal with and inform
about possible failures, inaccuracies and errors, proportionate to the assessed
risk posed by the AI-based system or technique
• socially robust, in that they duly consider the context and environment in which
they operate
• reliable and to function as intended, minimising unintentional and unexpected
harm, preventing unacceptable harm and safeguarding the physical and mental
integrity of humans

1. Introduction
In order to receive EU funding/tenders (i.e. grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc), applicants need to fulfill a certain number of conditions
which must be checked before any funding can be awarded to them.
Some of these checks are done centrally by the EU Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal Participant Register, set up in accordance with
Articles 128 and 147 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/10461 as central repository
and electronic data interchange area for participants.
This guidance sets out the rules that the Central Validation Service will use for these
checks. They currently cover:
− legal entity validation (also called ‘PIC validation’)
− LEAR appointment
− collecting the financial information for the financial capacity assessment (also
called ‘FCA’)
− ownership control assessment (also called ‘OCA’).
For these checks, the participants will be contacted directly by the Central Validation
Service and asked to submit the necessary information and supporting documents via
the Participant Register. This happens normally during preparation of the first grant,
procurement, prize or contribution agreement that successfully passed the evaluation
stage, but can also occur later during subsequent applications or in case of changes.
All data and documents will be treated as confidential.
Personal data will be handled in accordance with Regulation 2018/17252 to ensure
compliance with the principles of transparency, proportionality, impartiality and
legality. For the details, please refer to the Funding & Tenders Portal Privacy
Statement (available on Portal > Legal Notices).
2. Legal entity validation
2.1. Legal entity validation and specific legal statuses: Criteria and
conditions
One of the main tasks of the Central Validation Service is the validation of new legal
entities applying for EU grants, procurements, prizes and contribution agreements.
Legal entity validation is a requirement under the Financial Regulation. It serves to
ensure that only verified entities can enter into financial relations with the EU and to
avoid legally invalid contracts.
Legal entity validation is needed only once, to get the legal entity information and

participant identification code (PIC) validated. Once validated, the participants can
enter into financial relations with the EU and use the PIC for all EU actions managed
through the Funding & Tenders Portal. The PIC will be valid for all ongoing application
procedures and signature in the system, but also for any type of EU funding in the
future — without having to re-register or be re-validated.
This is why the standards for PIC validation are applied consistently, independently of
the specific call/application/tender procedure that triggers the validation. The same
criteria and checks are applied for grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc, as well as for low and high value contracts.
The validation comprises two distinct actions: (a) the verification that the participant
exists as legal entity capable of entering into financial relations with the EU, including
correctness of the participant’s legal data (legal form, address, etc) and (b) the
verification of certain specific legal statuses that are used in EU funding programmes
and recorded centrally in the Participant Register.
2.1.1 Legal entity validation
‘Legal entity’ means a natural person or an entity created and recognised by law as a
legal person. It must have legal personality and, acting on its own account and in its
own name, be able to exercise rights and be subject to obligations.
Specific cases
❖ Natural persons (including self-employed persons; see below) — Are by default
considered as being legal entities. However, the Central Validation Service will refuse
validation of persons that cannot legally enter into contractual relations with the EU
(e.g. persons under age).
❖ Branches — Are not regarded as legal entities, since they do not have legal
personality distinct from that of their mother-company. The fact that they are
registered in national official registers is not relevant. It will be their mother-company
that will be considered as legal entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in
the Participant Register. The same applies to branches established in a different
country or branches of entities such as non-profit organisations, NGOs, etc.
❖ Foreign companies (company establishments which are registered with a special
status in the official register, e.g. ‘société de droit étranger’) — Will not be regarded
as legal entities, since they do not have legal personality distinct from that of their
mother-company. It will be their mother-company that will be considered as legal
entity for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register (the
one registered in the country of incorporation).
❖ Entities set-up within (or under) a parent organisation (such as
departments/centers/offices, without legal personality, despite having administrative
or budgetary autonomy, own VAT number/fiscal code/number of registration, etc) —
Cannot be regarded as legal entities and are considered as belonging to their parent-
organisation. It will be their parent organisation that will be considered as legal entity
for the purposes of the legal entity validation in the Participant Register.
2.1.2 Exception: Validation of private entities without legal personality
By way of exception, the Financial Regulation allows for certain ‘entities without legal
personality’ to be eligible for EU grants. Such entities can therefore be validated in
the Participant Register, provided they meet the conditions set out in Article
197(2)(c) of this Regulation:
7EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− their representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on behalf
of the entity
and
− the entity offers equivalent guarantees for the protection of the EU financial
interests as a legal person, in particular equivalent financial and operational
capacity (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
This exception aims at private entities, i.e. associations or similar entities with
permanent structures (secretariat, management board, assembly, etc.) that have
their own activities, but just lack formal legal personality.
Concerning the first condition, the entity must prove its representatives' capacity to
undertake legal obligations on its behalf. This condition is not met when the
obligations are assumed on behalf of the representatives themselves or on behalf of
the owner(s) of the entity.
Concerning the second condition, the entity must prove the following elements:
− existence of patrimony/assets/capital separated and different from those of its
members/owners
and
− rules ensuring that creditors can rely on such patrimony/assets/capital and
that, in case of liquidation/insolvency, creditors are reimbursed prior to the
repartition of the patrimony/assets/capital among the owners/members (—
both conditions must be fulfilled and proved by supporting documents).
This exception only applies for participation in EU grants; entities without legal
personality cannot participate in EU tenders.
2.1.3 Exception: Validation of ministries, specialised entities of IOs and
certain EU bodies
By way of exception, the Central Validation Service will also accept the following
public entities without legal personality to be validated in the Participant Register:
− the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) (explicitly declared eligible by Articles
176(2) and 197(4) of the Financial Regulation)
− ministries, executive services which are part of the public administration of a
(central or federated) State and directly linked to the government and other
services which are part of the legislative or judicial administration, in
accordance with the official organisation of the State
− assimilated international organisations referred to in Article 156(2) of the
Financial Regulation
− specialised entities set up by international organisations, that lack legal
personality
− Common Foreign Security Policy (CFSP) missions and EU special
representatives set up by the Council of the European Union.
Departments/directorates/units/offices and other entities set up within a Ministry (or
within an executive or other service) without legal personality are considered as part
of the same Ministry (or service) and cannot be considered as independent legal
8EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
entities (e.g. schools, libraries, etc). They will have to use the PIC of their parent
organisation to participate in EU grants, procurements, prizes, etc.
2.1.4 Specific legal statuses
In addition, the validation covers the following specific legal statuses that are used in
certain EU funding programmes:
− private entity or public body
− non-profit or for profit organisation
− small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
− middle-capitalisation enterprise (mid-cap)
− non-governmental organisation (NGO)
− civil society organisation (CSO)
− international organisation (IO)
− research organisation
− secondary or higher education establishment.
An entity may be categorised in more than one of these legal statuses (i.e. non-profit,
public body, research organisation, international organisation, etc.).
The practical relevance of these statuses (and what happens if they change) is
established at the level of the different funding programmes, and sometimes even at
the level of the call for proposals/call for tender.
Moreover, not all of these statuses are systematically checked and validated by the
Central Validation Service. Some of them are self-declarations or self-assessments.
This means that the participants are solely responsible for the correctness of the
information they provide (in the self-declaration/self-assessment).
The Central Validation Service may however — at any time — carry out checks on
self-declared/self-assessed statuses against supporting documents and ask for
clarifications.
In case of false declarations, the EU services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status(es)
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements,
etc.; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
Private entity or public body
'Private entity' means an entity established under private law.
‘Public body’ means an entity established as a public body by national law, or an
9EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
international organisation.
‘Established as a public body by national law’ means:
− incorporated as a public body in the act of creation or recognised as a public
body by national law
and
− governed by public law (— both conditions must be fulfilled).
Criteria such as:
− mission or activity in the general interest (public service mission)
− the fact that the shares are owned by a public body (even if ownership reaches
up to 100% of the share capital)
− public financing
− state supervision and control
do NOT constitute sufficient evidence to qualify an entity as a public body, if the
above two conditions are not met.
Public bodies may however act and be subject to private law for some or most of their
activities, provided that, concerning their existence and their functioning, they are
subject to public law.
The two statuses (private entity and public body) are mutually exclusive, meaning
that you can only be validated as one or the other.
They are systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the
Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Self-employed persons (persons who perform an activity independently and with
their own means, such as craftsmen and individuals exercising liberal, industrial and
commercial professions) — Are regarded as ‘natural persons’, not as ‘private entities’;
the business/profession/activity they perform is not provided with independent legal
personality different from that of the person.
❖ Private law bodies with a public service mission3 — A legal entity
incorporated under private law/private legal form is not considered to be a public
body even if owned by the State/other public bodies and/or pursuing a public service
mission.
Non-profit
‘Non-profit entity’ means an entity that is non-profit making by its legal form or legal
purpose (e.g. charitable organisations), or that has a legal or statutory obligation not
to distribute profits to its shareholders or members.
All profits have to be reinvested in the same activity of the entity.
3 Article 62(1)(c)(vi) of Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
10EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Decisions on (not) distributing profits made by the managing board, associates,
stakeholders, members, or representatives and/or practices adopted by the entity to
not distribute profits and/or the absence of profits achieved are not sufficient proof of
the non-profit nature. The obligation not to distribute profits and/or the impossibility
to distribute profits must be based on law and/or the act of establishment/articles of
association/statutes, etc.
Whether the owners/founders of the entity are non-profit and whether the profits are
allocated to non-profit (or for profit) entities is irrelevant.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
Specific cases
❖ Public bodies — Are in principle regarded as non-profit by default.
❖ Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) — The classification as ‘non-
governmental organisation (NGO)’ is not relevant for the non-profit status, since in
most countries NGO is not a recognized legal form. By contrast, non-profit status is a
prerequisite for the self-declaration as NGO (see below).
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)
‘Small or medium sized enterprise (SME)’ means a micro, small or medium-sized
enterprise as defined in the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361, i.e.:
− engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form (including, in
particular, self-employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or
other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an
economic activity)
and
− employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as
defined in Article 5 of the SME Recommendation) and which have an annual
turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and/or an annual balance sheet total
not exceeding EUR 43 million.4
An entity is considered to be engaged in an ‘economic activity’, if it proves to be
involved in any form of trade or activity done for remuneration or pecuniary interest
on the market. Thus, in general, any activity consisting in (directly or indirectly)
offering goods or services on a given market is an economic activity.
The following will NOT be considered economic activities:
− activities which do not entail (directly or indirectly) some sort of pecuniary
offset or
− activities for which there is no given/direct (or indirect) market or
− activities for which the income generated is not distinct from the personal
income of the entity’s members or shareholders.
4 The SME ceilings must be calculated by including the headcount of staff, the balance sheet total and the
turnover data of all relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361.
11EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
This status is self-declared. For calls where the SME status has an impact on eligibility
or funding (higher funding rate, etc), participants must go through a self-assessment
wizard.
Two-year rule — In accordance with Article 4.2 of the SME Recommendation, the SME
status depends on the ceilings for two consecutive accounting periods. Headcount and
turnover must stay below the ceilings for two accounting periods to obtain the SME
status; conversely, the status will be lost if they rise above the ceilings for two
consecutive periods.
Since the SME self-assessment looks at the information for only one accounting
period (the last one), the SME self-assessment result may be flawed. Participants that
were below the ceiling the year before, must contact the Central Validation Service
via the Participant Register in order to request a formal validation. This validation will
then take into account the two accounting periods.
The two-year rule does not apply for changes due to a merger or acquisition.
Enterprises that are subject to a change in ownership need to be assessed on the
basis of their shareholder structure at the time of the transaction. If the aggregated
headcount and financial data of the new structure exceed the SME ceilings, the SME
status is lost immediately from the date of the transaction5.
Participants whose SME status changes after registration must update their data in
the Participant Register. This is important not only for eligibility checks in grant
applications, but also for statistical purposes.
Specific cases
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that do not yet have
closed accounts or companies without economic activity but expecting to enter
soon into the market — May also qualify as SMEs, as long as they are able to provide
a ‘bona fide estimate’ (in the form of a business plan) covering the period necessary
for the entity to generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long time-to market
— Are allowed to demonstrate that they are engaged in an economic activity by
showing the investments made and the likely expected return.
Middle-capitalisation enterprise (Mid-cap)
'Middle-capitalisation enterprise’ means an enterprise that is:
− not a micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under the EU SME
Recommendation 2003/361
and
− employing up to 3 000 persons6 , where the headcount of staff, including all
relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises, is calculated in
accordance with Article 3 to 6 of the Annex to the Recommendation.
This status is self-declared. For calls where the mid-cap status has an impact on
eligibility or funding (higher funding rate, etc.), participants must go through the SME
5 See Recital 9 of Recommendation No, 2003/361/EC and the User Guide to the SME Definition (p. 14).
6 Expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of the Annex of EU recommendation
2003/361.
12EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
self-assessment wizard to make sure that they do not fall under the definition of SME,
and then to self-declare that the number of employees does not exceed 3 000
persons.
Non-governmental organisation (NGO)
‘Non-governmental organisations’ are organisations which are voluntary, independent
from government and non-profit, and which are not a political party or trade union.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by private entities,
which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Civil society organisation (CSO)
‘Civil society organisations’ are organisations from the ‘third sector’ of society, distinct
from government and business (i.e. private for profit entities).
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will normally be accepted only by private
entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
International organisation (IO)
‘International organisation’ means an intergovernmental organisation (other than the
EU) established under international public law, including specialised entities — with or
without legal personality — set up by international organisations.
This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by
the Central Validation Service.
For some EU funding programmes there are moreover specific subtypes of
international organisations:
− ‘international organisations of European interest for H2020 (H2020 IOEI)’, i.e.
international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member
States or H2020 associated countries and whose main objective is promoting
scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international European research organisations for Horizon Europe (HE IERO)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries and whose main
objective is promoting scientific and technological cooperation in Europe
− ‘international organisations of European interest for Digital Europe (DEP IOEI)’,
i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU
Member States or whose headquarters are in an EU Member State.
The H2020 IOEI subtype status is systematically checked against supporting
documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.
The HE IERO and DEP IOEI subtype statuses are self-declared. In the future, for calls
where the HE IERO and DEP IOEI statuses have an impact on eligibility or funding,
participants will also be asked to go through a self-assessment wizard.
Specific cases
❖ Entities set up as distinct bodies by an international organisation with a
special mission but which do not have explicit legal personality — Can be validated
as with legal personality, if they meet any of the following criteria:
− they have treaty-making capacity or
13EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− they have capacity to act at international level independently from the
organisation that set them up (i.e. capacity to undertake legal obligations).
If such entities do not meet one of the above criteria, they can exceptionally be
validated as without legal personality (see section 2.1.3 above).
Research organisation
‘Research organisation’ means an entity that:
− is established as non-profit organisation as described above
and
− carries out research and/or technological development as its main objective.
The following are NOT considered research activities:
− supporting or financing research activities carried out by other entities
− promoting, managing or coordinating research activities.
Only entities that have research and/or development as their main objective can
qualify as research organisations. By contrast, entities that have research and/or
development as ancillary activities (even if regular and substantial, e.g. in museums
or hospitals) do not qualify as ‘research organisations’.
This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by entities, which
have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
Secondary or higher education establishment
‘Secondary or higher education establishment’ means an entity that is recognised as
such by its national education system and is able to deliver diplomas recognised by
the State.
It can be a public body or a private entity (see above). The national accreditation as a
secondary/higher education establishment is not sufficient to consider the entity as a
public body.
This status is self-declared.
2.2 Documents and information to provide
2.2.1 General requirements and principles
The legal validation of entities is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participants as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
by the participants on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (can be
required by the EU services at any time).
In principle only official documents are accepted. Documents are considered as official
when they are delivered by official national authorities. Official documents can NOT be
replaced by self-declarations or by sworn or solemn statements before judicial or
administrative authorities, notaries or public officers.
As a general rule, documents are accepted in any of the EU official languages.
Participants may however be requested to submit an English free (unofficial)
translation to facilitate the validation process. Documents in non-EU languages will be
accepted only if accompanied by a free translation in English (and in case of doubt, a
14EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
certified/legal translation in English may be requested). Free translations should
always be accompanied by the copies of the original official documents.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as for any information provided by other means
(e.g. by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw and correct the validated status
− terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
2.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Signed legal entity identification form7:
− Natural Person Form: in English
− Private Legal Entity Form: in English
− Public Legal Entity Form: in English.
2. Official VAT document or — if the entity is not registered for VAT — the proof of
VAT exemption, not older than one (1) year.
For the specific legal statuses, participants will be asked to submit the following
additional documents:
Status Documents to be submitted
Private entity A valid registration extract not older than one (1) year.
Documents older than one year may be accepted if valid for a
(including SME and mid-cap)
certain period of time expressly indicated in the same
document (e.g. valid for two years) and if submitted via the
Participant Register within this period of time.
Public body Copy of the act, law, decree or decision that established the
entity as a public body (or, if this does not exist, any other
official legal document that proves this).
Natural person Integral copy (legible) of valid identity card or passport (e.g. in
case of identity card, both sides must be provided).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Entities without legal personality Copy of an official document attesting that the representatives
of the entity have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on
its behalf.
Copy of an official document attesting that the entity has the
same operational and financial viability as that of a legal entity:
i.e.
1. a document showing patrimony/assets/capital that
are separated and different from those of the
members/owners of the entity, and
2. a copy of the rules providing that creditors can rely
on this patrimony/assets/capital and — in case of
liquidation/insolvency — are reimbursed before the
patrimony/assets/capital are divided between the
owners/members.
Non-profit Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is non-
profit by its legal form or by its legal purpose, or that it has a
legal or statutory obligation not to distribute profits to
shareholders or individual members.
The certificate of tax exemption is only an indication of the
non-profit status and will therefore be assessed together with
other elements.
Small or medium sized enterprise (SME) The following documents must be provided for the participant
and mid-caps and for its linked and partner entities (in accordance with
Articles 3 to 6 of the Annex to the EU SME Recommendation
(— if expressly requested by the Central
2003/361):
Validation Service)
1. graph showing the complete ownership structure,
including all direct and indirect shareholders
2. proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners
and their respective percentage of interest and voting
rights
3. approved financial statements for the most recent
closed accounting period, including:
− balance sheet statement
− profit and loss account, clearly indicating the
amount of annual turnover from sales of goods
and services
− annexes to these documents and/or
accompanying notes, indicating (i) staff head
count and (ii) any equity participations in other
companies/downstream organisations with
exact percentage of the shares and voting rights
held. If the annexes/notes to the financial
statements do not contain the requested
information, other documents can be provided
that contain equivalent data (such as headcount
reports for social security purposes, extracts from
HR records certifying headcount, etc); in
exceptional cases, self-declarations can be
accepted
4. documents explaining the mechanisms of ownership
and control, corporate governance and decision-
making rules (e.g. statutes/articles of association and
shareholders’ agreements; memorandum of
16EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
understanding among shareholders, internal corporate
governance rules, etc)
Sworn or solemn statements before a judicial or
administrative authority, notary or public officer cannot replace
the above listed documents as proof of the SME or mid-cap
status.
The following documents must be submitted in the below
specific cases:
❖ Newly established enterprises (e.g. start-up companies) that
do not yet have closed accounts — Instead of approved
financial statements, a self-declaration must be provided,
including a bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan)
for the entire period (financial years) necessary for the entity to
generate turnover.
❖ Enterprises without turnover whose activity implies a long
time-to market — In addition to the approved financial
statements, a self-declaration must be provided, including a
bona fide estimate (in the form of a business plan) for the
entire period (financial years) necessary to generate turnover,
including a declaration of the investment made and the likely
expected return (to demonstrate that, despite the lack of
turnover, the enterprise is engaged in an economic activity).
❖ Entities owned directly or indirectly by natural persons —
Self-declaration on the natural person(s) engagement in
economic activity and possible participations in other entities
must be provided. The template for the self-declaration will be
provided to participants during the validation process if specific
cases of ownership by natural persons are identified.
International organisation Copy of the international treaty creating the organisation under
international public law.
Research organisation Copy of an official document attesting research or technological
development as the main objective of the entity.
(— if expressly requested by the Central
Validation Service)
Secondary or higher education Copy of an official document attesting that the entity is
establishment recognised as ‘secondary or higher education establishment’ by
the national education system and is entitled to deliver
(— if expressly requested by the Central
diplomas recognized by the State.
Validation Service)
For other categories such as NGO, Civil Society Organisation, etc no supporting
documents are needed (unless exceptionally requested by the Central Validation
Service).
2.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
17EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− the documents submitted are outdated (e.g. VAT document or extract of
registration no longer valid or more than one (1) year old)
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the validation (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
2.3 Validation and effective date
On the basis of the submitted information and documents, the participant will be
validated with the effective date of entry into force of the legal act establishing its
constitution or incorporation (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
That date will be, in order of precedence:
1. the date of registration in the country's’official registry (e.g. commercial
registry)
2. the date of publication in the national official journal
3. the date of the legal deposit of the act in the court registry
4. the date of signature of the parties.
When there is no act of constitution or incorporation, the participant will be
considered to exist since a standard default date.
The effective date for the SME and mid-cap status will be the accounts closure date of
the accounting period on which the assessment is based in accordance with Article
4(2) of the Annex of the SME Recommendation 2003/361. For newly established
enterprises that do not yet have closed accounts, the effective date is the date of
their creation.
The effective date of other specific legal statuses is the date in which the specific
status enters into force. This date may be the same as its effective date of
constitution or incorporation (or may differ, if the specific status has been acquired
later on).
2.4 Modification of validations
Modifications in the validation can be made in the following cases:
− following a request submitted by the participant to update the validation (e.g.
in case of changes in the participant’s legal situation such as change of
identity/legal form, name, address, status) or
− after checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out by the EU services
which necessitate a correction.
2.4.1 Validation updates
In case of a change in the participant’s legal situation (identity/legal form, name,
address, status, etc), the participant must request an update of the validation.
18EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Requests to update a validation will be accepted, if submitted by the participant’s
LEAR and accompanied by the relevant supporting documents. If no LEAR has
been appointed yet in the Participant Register, requests for modification should be
submitted after the LEAR appointment has been validated.
The ‘effective date of the change’ will be the date on which the act establishing the
change enters into force (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).
For SMEs and mid-caps, the effective date is the closure date of the accounting period
on which the change of status is based. For cases of mergers and acquisitions that
lead to the loss of the SME or mid-cap status, the effective date of change will be the
date when the ownership structure changed.
The impact and practical consequences of the changes depend on each funding
programme.
2.4.2 Corrections of validations
If a validation turns out to beincorrect (through an audit, ex-post check, investigation
or other means), it will be corrected by the Central Validation Service. The correction
will be registered with effect back to the effective date of the initial validation.
If the error is attributable to the Central Validation Service and its correction implies
disadvantages for the participant, the retroactive effect may exceptionally be waived,
if duly justified and in line with the principles of sound financial management and
proportionality.
If the error was the fault of the participant (intentional or unintentional), its
participation in on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc
may be terminated and undue amounts paid may be recovered. Moreover, the
participant may be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements,
prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial
Regulation). In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
2.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If they find out that a participant did not meet the criteria for being validated or for
being validated with a specific legal status (e.g. due to false declarations), the
modification of the validation will be registered with retroactive effect back to the
effective date of the validation.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements, etc, their participation may be terminated/withdrawn and
undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.

3. Validation of the LEAR appointment
3.1 Validation of the LEAR appointment: General requirements and principles
In parallel with the legal entity validation, the Central Validation Service will contact
the participants to appoint their Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR), i.e.
the single point of contact needed for the Participant Register and Funding & Tenders
Portal electronic exchange system.
The appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register is mandatory for all
validated participants. Without LEAR it will NOT be possible to update the legal entity
data in the Participant Register, nor sign contracts electronically in the Funding &
Tenders Portal.
3.1.1 Role of the LEAR
The LEAR is the person officially appointed by the participant to handle their access
rights and key data in the Participant Register (legal and other data, certain access
rights in the electronic exchange system, etc.).
Once validated, it is the LEAR who is responsible for giving access rights to the Portal
electronic exchange system and who must ensure that the participant’s legal
information is always up to date.
The LEAR must enter and update on the ‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen the names
of the:
− legal representatives and signatories for the organisation (so-called ‘LSIGNs’);
these are people who are able to commit the organisation legally by signing
contracts and authorising amendments to them and
− persons that may sign cost statements on behalf of the organisation (so-called
‘FSIGNs’).
If needed, the LEARs can delegate their tasks to one or more colleagues, who will act
as account administrators (so-called ‘AccAds’; delegation also through the
‘LEAR/Authorised User’ tab screen).
In case of changes, the LEAR must encode the change in the Participant Register and,
if needed, request validation and provide supporting documents.
For a detailed description of the LEAR rights and responsibilities, see the LEAR
appointment letter*.
3.1.2 Position of the LEAR
The LEAR is an administrative function that may be held by the participant’s legal
representative or another key person within the entity.
The LEAR must be someone employed in the entity (most commonly in the central
administrative services of the entity) and should be able to ensure the stability and
continuity that is needed to fulfil this role in order to honour the participant’s
contractual obligations.
Participants that are natural persons will automatically have the role of LEAR; in this
case the role cannot be attributed to a different person (but the LEAR can appoint an
account administrator).
20EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Each participant can only appoint one LEAR and must ensure to immediately replace
their LEAR in case they are no longer able to exercise the role (e.g. job change,
dismissal, death, etc; see section 3.3).
The participant assumes the full responsibility for the choice of the person they
appoint as LEAR.
3.1.3 Legal representative
The LEAR must be appointed by the participant’s legal representative. The legal
representative is a person duly authorised to act on behalf of the entity and to
commit it in its entirety vis-à-vis third parties.
Specific cases
❖ Persons tasked with the daily management — Can not be recognized as legal
representatives if they are not entitled to engage and represent the entity outside
ordinary day-to-day business matters.
The ‘daily management’ (‘gestion journalière’) is commonly understood as comprising
those acts that, because of their minor importance or the need for a prompt solution,
do not justify the intervention of the management bodies. It consists of ordinary
business and execution of day-to-day decisions and in line with the general
instructions of the management board.
❖ Limitations — Similarly, persons empowered to engage and commit the
participant only within certain limits (including financial limits) can not be accepted as
legal representatives for the purposes of the LEAR appointment.
3.1.4 Timing of the LEAR appointment
The process for appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register can run in parallel
to the validation of the entity, but can only be finalised once the participant (PIC) is
validated.
LEAR appointment is not a condition for the submission of a proposal/tender in the
Funding & Tenders Portal, but its validation must be completed before the the grant,
procurement or contribution agreement can be signed.
3.2 List of documents and information
For the validation of the LEAR appointment, the scanned version of the following
documents must be uploaded by the participant in the Participant Register:
1. LEAR appointment letter* (specifying the LEAR roles & duties and including the
declaration of consent to the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and
Conditions*), completed, dated and signed by the legal representative and the
LEAR
2. Integral copy of an official, valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport, with
photo and signature) of:
− the legal representative and
− the appointed representative (LEAR)
3. Document(s) proving that the legal representative(s) appointing the LEAR is
empowered as such, which must:
21EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− clearly indicate the role/function within the organisation as legal
representative
− identify and appoint this person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
The originals must be kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which
can be required by the EU services at any time). They must not be sent to the Central
Validation Service.
After receiving the above-listed documents (and after the PIC has been validated),
the LEAR appointment will be validated in the Participant Register.
For a detailed description of the LEAR appointment process, see the Online Manual*
and the Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions*.
Proof of identity
‘Identity documents’ are those issued by national authorities and recognized by
national law as valid proof of identity. Identity documents can not be replaced by any
other means of proof. The EU services cannot waive this requirement under any
circumstances.
Examples of identity documents accepted are ID cards and passports. Driving licenses
are also accepted, as long as they are considered as valid proof of identity under the
applicable national law of the entity concerned.
Identity documents must be valid (not expired) at the time of the LEAR appointment.
An integral copy of the document must be provided (e.g. in most countries both sides
of the identity card must be provided).
Identity documents in which some parts/elements, including the photo, have been
deleted/erased/covered (e.g. with black marker) cannot be accepted.
Specific cases
❖ Service cards and badges issued by the participant — Cannot replace identity
documents (even if the participant is a public body) and therefore cannot be accepted
as proof of identity.
❖ Print-outs from the ID electronic chip — Cannot be accepted either.
Signatures
The LEAR documents must be signed by persons who are legal representatives of the
participant.
The names of both legal representative and LEAR in the LEAR documents must
correspond to those indicated in their official identity documents. LEAR documents
signed with acronyms/nick names/etc that do not correspond to the names indicated
in the identity documents will not be accepted.
Signatures can be either handwritten signatures or qualified electronic signatures
22EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
within the meaning of Article 3(12) of Regulation 910/20148. For the latter, the
Central Validation Service will verify that the signature is based on a valid qualified
certificate and was created by a secure creation device. See here for the list of
accepted trust service providers: eIDAS Dashboard (europa.eu).
Specific cases
❖ Internal requirements (e.g. joint signature of more than one person required to
legally engage the entity, foreseen by law, act of establishment, statutes, internal
rules, etc) — In case of internal requirements, the participant is fully responsible for
ensuring compliance (e.g. through an internal process ensuring that the single
signature on the LEAR documents is made only after all the internal requirements on
joint signature are fulfilled).
❖ Limitations — The Central Validation Service will take into account limitations to
represent the entity only if these limitations are explicitly mentioned in the
documents submitted to prove the empowerment of the legal representative (e.g.
limitation in the excerpts of the company registry).
Documents proving the empowerment of the legal representative
The document(s) proving the empowerment must identify:
− the role/function of legal representative within the entity
− the name and appointment of the person (by indicating their personal data) for
that role.
This can be found in a single document (in case the official appointment also specifies
the powers/tasks related to the appointment) or in several documents combined (e.g.
the official act of appointment and the organisational document, such as act of
establishment, statutes, articles of association, etc, in which the powers/tasks related
to the role are identified).
The documents must be valid (not expired) at the time when the LEAR is appointed.
The documents proving the appointment of the legal representative are those
required/accepted under the applicable national law of the entity concerned. They
may vary depending on the country, the legal form and status:
− law/decree/official act/official gazette in case of public entities
− copy of the treaty in case of international organisations
− decision of assembly, official documents from the council of administration,
executive committee or directors board, excerpts of the company registry in
case of private entities.
A declaration of honour can be accepted only in exceptional, duly justified cases
where none of the above exists.
Concerning the language of such documents and participant's responsibilities
concerning translations, see section 2.2.1.
8 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on
electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (OJ L 257,
28.8.2014, p. 73).

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Specific cases
❖ Participants who are natural persons — Do not need to prove their
empowerment, but still need to send the supporting documents listed above. The
documents should be signed by the natural person alone. A copy of the ID documents
of the natural person must also be included.
❖ Deputising persons — In case of temporary absence of the legal
representative(s) or their impossibility to sign, other persons empowered to act as
legal representatives (i.e. deputising persons) are accepted as legal representatives
by default. The reason for the temporary absence/impossibility and the legitimation of
the deputy will not be checked by the Central Validation Service and therefore
remains under the full responsibility of the participant (see also above under ‘internal
requirements’).
❖ Ministries — For ministries, Ministers are considered legal representatives by
default and there is no need to provide the legal documents proving their
empowerment.
In addition to the Minister's role, the following roles/functions are considered as legal
representatives by default, without any further verification of the legal documents
proving their empowerment:
− Deputy Minister
− State/General Secretary and their deputies
− Directors of certain specific horizontal sectors/departments/directions, namely
'legal', 'financial','European or international relationships'.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the ministry, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website of the ministry).
Except if otherwise provided in the applicable rules (law/decree/act governing the
organisation of the ministry), other roles such as ‘Director’/‘Had of Department’/‘Head
of Unit’, etc will be considered as having limited tasks and powers (relating only to
the directorate/department/unit’s policies) and, therefore, not entitled to represent
and engage the ministry as a whole.
For Ministers, the ID document can be exceptionally replaced by a badge or service
card (issued by the ministry). This exception applies only to the person of the
‘Minister’ and cannot be extended to other representatives (such as State Secretaries,
Deputy Ministers or Directors/Head of Departments); these persons are not exempted
from the obligation to provide an ID document.
❖ Public bodies and governmental entities — For public bodies and other
state/governmental entities, including executive services at central/regional/local
level, the highest-ranked person (e.g. Director-General, President, Mayor, etc) will be
recognized as legal representative by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the entity, the evidence may be
taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the organisational chart
published on the official website).
❖ International organisations — For international organisations, the highest-
ranked person (e.g. Secretary, Secretary-General) will be recognised as legal
representative by default.
24EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the international organisation, the
evidence may also be taken from other appropriate sources (e.g. Official Gazette, the
organisational chart published on the official website of the international
organisation).
❖ Universities and higher education establishments — For universities and
other higher education establishments (e.g. colleges, institutes, etc), the following
roles/functions are recognised as legal representative by default, without any further
verification of their powers:
− Rector and Vice-Rector
− President and Vice-President
− Chancellor and Vice Chancellor.
In case of faculties with their own legal personality (and thus independently
validated), the Dean and Vice-Dean can also act as legal representatives by default.
If the official act of appointment is not provided by the university/higher education
establishment/faculty, the evidence may also be taken from other appropriate
sources (e.g. the organisational chart published on the official internet-site of the
university/faculty).
3.3 LEAR replacement
A LEAR replacement is equivalent to a new LEAR appointment. For the replacement of
an already validated LEAR, participants must submit the same type of documents and
the Central Validation Service will follow the procedure for the validation of LEAR
appointment (see above).
3.4 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant did not respect the obligation to keep the original
documents or committed other irregularities, appropriate measures will be taken.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, or
contribution agreements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts
paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
4. Financial capacity assessment
4.1 Financial capacity assessment: Criteria and conditions
In addition to the legal entity validation and LEAR appointment, the Central Validation
Service also assists the EU services with the financial capacity assessment (required
by the Financial Regulation for grants and procurements; not needed for prizes or
contribution agreements).
25EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The financial capacity assessment must in principle be done for each new
application/tender (— unless the participant already has a valid financial capacity
assessment performed by the Central Validation Service that is not older than 18
months).
Additional conditions depend on the type of procedure (grant or procurement),
participant and grant amount (e.g. no financial capacity assessment is needed for
public bodies in grant procedures, for Member State organisations, international
organisations, persons in receipt of education support, persons most in need and in
receipt of direct support; for low-value grants and low-value procurements).
Additional exemptions are provided in some programmes for specific situations or
types of participants.
Moreover, the financial capacity may be assessed ad hoc if there are justified grounds
to doubt it, like for example:
− indication of weak/insufficient financial capacity from other sources
− involvement in cases of serious administrative errors or fraud
− pending legal procedures or judicial proceedings for serious administrative
errors or fraud
− attachment order or recovery order for an outstanding amount issued by an
EU body on which the payment is significantly overdue
− substantial findings in EU audits within the last 2 years that put in doubt the
financial capacity.
The financial capacity is assessed on the basis of financial indicators that are in
principle the same for all EU programmes.
The financial capacity assessment is normally done during grant preparation/tender
evaluation but may also be done during implementation. If a participants’ financial
capacity must be assessed, they will be contacted by the Central Validation Service
through the Funding & Tenders Portal.
The role of the Central Validation Service is to prepare the financial capacity
assessment (e.g. to collect and to analyse the financial documents). The final decision
on the financial capacity will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender separately
by the EU service in charge.
4.2 Documents and information to provide
4.2.1 General requirements and principles
The financial assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by the
participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be kept
on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the EU
services at any time).
As a general rule, financial documents must be provided in their original language(s),
as imposed by the legislation in the participant’s country of registration. For
documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit an English free
(unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in non-EU
languages, a free translation in English is always mandatory and needs to be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
26EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless
submit them (no need for a translation into the official language of the country).
Some examples of such documents are: dated and signed annual management
reports in English for a company listed on the stock exchange or having international
shareholders or for the purpose of consolidation within a foreign group; dated and
signed extracts from national registers that use English, etc.
The participants assume full responsibility for the content of the documents and the
accuracy of the translations, as well as any information provided by other means (e.g.
by Participant Register message, etc).
In case of false declarations (or intentional manipulation of a translation), the EU
services may:
− withdraw or correct the financial assessment
− terminate on-going grants and procurements (and recover any undue
amounts)
− impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from
future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc;
see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
4.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Profit and loss account — approved by the management of the entity, clearly
indicating the amounts of turnover from sales of goods and services, operating
income, staff, depreciation, amortization costs, net operating result and
interest expenses. If this information is not indicated in the profit and loss
account or in the explanatory notes it must be provided in the form of a self-
declaration.
2. Balance sheet statement — approved by the management, clearly indicating
the nature and the maturity (i.e. below or above one year) of receivables and
other current assets, grants, provisions and debts. If this information is not
indicated in the balance sheet or in the explanatory notes it must be provided
in the form of a self-declaration.
3. Explanatory notes and/or annexes that form part of the above financial
statements (if available).
4. External audit report or self-declaration
Participants requesting a grant amount of above 750 000 EUR (for action
grants) or above 100 000 EUR (for operating grants) must provide:
− an statutory audit report issued by an approved/certified external
auditor if:
− such a report is available or
− a statutory audit is required under EU or national law
or
27EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
− a declaration on the validity of the accounts* (self-declaration), signed
by the legal representative of the entity, which certifies the validity of
the accounts.
The documents provided must cover the last two closed financial years. The most
recent year must have been closed within the last 18 months.
Exceptions are allowed for:
− start-up companies without closed annual accounts which provide
prospective data (business plan) for one year only
− recently created entities which have closed annual accounts for one year
only. These entities will be assessed based on the documents for the sole
closed financial year
A single financial document containing comparative data of the annual accounts of
both years under assessment will be accepted. The same applies to an external audit
report covering the two financial years.
If some (or all) of the documents have already been provided for the financial years
in question (i.e. uploaded in the Participant Register), the participant does not need
to submit them again.
The audit report must include:
− the clear mandate and scope of the audit
− the responsibilities of the management and the auditor
− the way in which the audit is carried out
− the auditor’s opinion, including a reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
All documents must be provided simultaneously (profit and loss account, balance
sheet, audit report/self-declaration, etc).
No audit report/self-declaration is needed for entities participating in tender
procedures, for natural persons and entities without closed accounts.
Specific cases
❖ Subsidiaries without own financial statements — Subsidiaries which do not
prepare their own financial statements may provide the consolidated accounts and
the audit report/self-declaration of the parent company/group they belong to under
the following conditions:
− the entity is exempt under national law from statutory audits
− only consolidated statements of the parent company/group the entity belongs
to are available
and
− the parent company assumes joint liability for all the debts of the entity (— all
conditions must be fulfilled).
In such cases, participants will be requested to provide additional documents to prove
these conditions.
28EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
❖ Parent companies — Parent companies which are exempt under national law
from publishing individual (i.e. non-consolidated) financial statements will be
requested to provide a dated and signed by the management simplified summary of
their non-consolidated profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
These simplified accounts must respect either the minimum reporting requirements
set out in the national accounting law or Annexes III, IV, V and VI of Directive
2013/349 (for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings
preceded by letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
If the provided financial information is not sufficiently clear, the Central Validation
Service may contact participants for further clarifications.
❖ Newly established enterprises that have not yet closed accounts — Must
provide estimated financial data (i.e. a business plan or a similar document including
financial projections on current and non-current assets, own capital, current and non-
current liabilities, turnover, operating and financial income and charges).
The financial data must respect either the minimum reporting requirements set out in
the national accounting law or to Annexes III, IV, V and VI of EU Directive 2013/34
(for the balance sheet, aggregate information limited to the headings preceded by
letters and roman numerals is sufficient).
❖ Natural persons engaged in an economic activity who do not prepare financial
statements in relation to their business activities — Are requested to provide:
− the annual income tax declaration containing details on the revenues and
expenses from business activity
− a signed declaration of patrimony, including:
− fixed patrimony (e.g. land, tenement, hereditament, medium/long-term
deposits (more than one year), stock options that cannot be exercised
within one year)
− current patrimony (e.g. available cash, savings, short-term deposits
(maximum of one year), stock-options that can be exercised within one
year)
and
− a signed declaration of debts, which must contain all liabilities (with dates and
figures), broken down in short-term debts (of maximum one year) and
medium/long-term debts (of more than one year).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities operating cash-based accounting — If the available financial
documents do not contain a profit and loss account and a balance sheet but are
limited to a cash flow statement and/or do not contain sufficient information10,
9 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual
financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of
undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and
repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19–76).
10 E.g. missing information on the nature of revenues, expenses or equity, nature and liquidity of
receivables and assets, maturity of debts etc.
29EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
declarations signed by the authorised legal representative of the entity may be
accepted, if they provide:
− information on fixed and current assets: buildings, equipment, inventory, cash,
short/long term11 deposits, short/long term receivables, sort/long term
liabilities, grants and equity/sources of funding, etc
− information on revenues and expenses, such as turnover from sales of goods
and services, operating income, staff expenses depreciation/amortisation
costs, interest expenses, etc.
In addition, it is recommended to provide any available evidence supporting the
declared amounts (e.g. bank statements confirming the available balance at
accounting closure date, etc).
The Central Validation Service may request additional evidence or information if
needed.
❖ Entities covered by a guarantor — Entities that are covered by a full financial
guarantee of another legal entity (i.e. guarantor) may submit the financial data of the
guarantor, provided that it is a full guarantee (i.e. the guarantor has assumed full
joint liability for all debts). Ad-hoc guarantees (covering, for instance, only the
participation in EU projects) cannot be accepted.
Participants that would like to have the financial capacity of their guarantor
assessed, must first contact the service in charge of their application for approval of
the guarantee. In case of approval, the service in charge will request the Central
Validation Service to proceed with the assessment of the guarantor.
4.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
to refuse the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents
submitted or publicly available).
If the financial documents do not contain sufficient information regarding the nature
and the maturity of the current assets, provisions and liabilities, and such information
is not provided, the financial assessment will be completed by taking the most
prudent approach, e.g. by considering the maturity of the current assets to be after
one year, and of the provisions and liabilities to be within one year.
11 Short term — maximum of one year; long term — more than one year.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The financial assessment is valid for 18 months after the closure date of the most
recent assessed accounting period. If during this period the participant applies for
another grant or tender, the financial documents will not be requested again.
However, if there are justified grounds to doubt the financial capacity, a new
assessment may be triggered even before the end of the 18 months.
4.4 Modification of the assessment
In case of disagreement with the assessment, the participant may contact the Central
Validation Service by sending additional justifications via Participant Register
message. The subject of the message should be clearly labelled as related to the
financial assessment (not PIC validation, LEAR assessment or other).
The Central Validation Service will carry out a re-assessment on the basis of the
additional documents.
4.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant made false declarations, their status may be
changed.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants or procurements, their
participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
5. Ownership control assessment
5.1 Ownership control assessment: Criteria and conditions
For funding programmes which have restricted calls in which only participants which
are directly or indirectly controlled by EU Member States or by nationals of EU
Member States (or by entities or nationals of specified eligible countries) are eligible,
the Central Validation Service will also handle the ownership control assessment
analysis.
The ownership control assessment must in principle be done for each new grant,
procurement or contribution agreement (— unless the participant already has a valid
ownership control assessment in the system performed by the Central Validation
Service that is not older than 18 months).
Moreover, the ownership control may be assessed ad hoc if there are grounds
justifying a new assessment, like for example:
− indication of third country control from other sources
− indication of ownership control changes after the initial assessment.
31EU Funding & Tenders: Rules for LEV, LEAR Appointment and FCA: V5.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
The ownership control assessment will usually look into both ownership and control
elements, in order to assess whether an entity is EU controlled or non-EU controlled.
The focus is however on control (see Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and
CEF-DIG restricted calls*).
In this context, ‘control’ will be defined as the possibility to exercise decisive influence
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate entities, ‘de jure’ or ‘de facto’.
The fact that no influence is actually exercised is not relevant, as long as the
possibility exists.
Control will be assessed at the level of the ultimate ownership and control line and all
intermediate layers (in case of indirect control), taking into consideration decision-
making mechanisms, corporate governance, shareholders’/members’ rights, etc.
The assessment is based on the information provided by the participant in the
ownership control declaration* (annexed to their application for EU funding or
procurement procedure) and supporting documents to be provided by the participant
during the ownership control assessment procedure.
The role of the Central Validation Service is limited to identifying instances of
possible non-EU-country/entity control (e.g. to collect and to analyse the supporting
documents). The final decision will be taken later, and for each proposal/tender
separately by the EU service in charge, in accordance with the specific programme
rules.If needed, during grant preparation, the EU service in charge may contact
participants about the outcome of the ownership control assessment.
5.2 Documents and information to provide
5.2.1 General requirements and principles
The ownership control assessment is in principle based on documents submitted by
the participant as scanned versions via the Participant Register. Originals should be
kept on file for checks, reviews, audits or investigations (which can be required by the
EU services at any time).
As a general rule, ownership control documents must be provided in their original
language. For documents in EU languages, participants may be requested to submit
an English free (unofficial) translation to facilitate the assessment. For documents in
non-EU languages, a free translation in English is mandatory and must be provided
together with the original documents. In case of doubt, a certified/legal translation in
English may be requested. If the participants have original documents in an EU
language which is not the official language of their country, they can nevertheless

see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation)
− inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
5.2.2 List of documents and information
The participants will be asked to submit the following documents and information:
1. Graph visualising the complete ownership structure/chain of control, including
all ownership layers/chain of control until the ultimate owners.
2. Proof of the direct and indirect shareholders/owners and their respective
percentage of interest and voting rights, for instance commercial registry
extracts, articles of association/incorporation documents/memorandum of
association/company’s shareholders/members/partners book/registry extract,
etc with the exact distribution of shares/voting rights, i.e. name of
shareholders/members/partners and their percentage of interest andvoting
rights, as well as information on their place of establishment (in case of legal
entity) or nationality (in case of natural persons).
3. Statutes, articles of association, shareholders’/partnership agreements,
memorandum of understanding among shareholders, investment agreements
between shareholders and other relevant documents regarding the decision-
making procedures within the legal entity and the related rights of the
shareholders/members/partners.
4. Documents establishing/describing the decision-making bodies, rules regarding
election, appointment, nomination, dismissal and tenure of members, and
decision-making procedures (e.g. articles of association, bylaws, reports on
corporate governance, internal corporate governance rules, minutes of board
meetings, etc).
5. For participants that are listed companies, subsidiaries or controlled by a listed
company: report/minutes of the last three shareholders meetings, together
with the attendance list identifying the present/represented shareholders and
their respective votes.
6. Cooperation agreements with customers or suppliers, when they could confer
control over the participant — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
7. For shareholders/owners that provide financial contributions: supporting
documents (loans, by-laws, etc) that justify the financial contribution;
documents showing the link between the shareholder/owner and the entity
providing the financing — if expressly requested by the Central Validation
Service.
8. Information about any other means, process or links that could ultimately
confer control to a non-EU country or non-EU country entity.
9. Copy of ID card(s) or passport(s) indicating the nationality of the ultimate
owner(s).
The same documents and information must be provided for each intermediate
controlling entity, up to the ultimate owners. The supporting documents must

non-controlling entities.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Guarantees for non-EU controlled entities (if allowed by the call conditions and
required by the EU service in charge) are not part of the ownership control
assessment and must therefore be submitted directly to the EU service in charge of
the grant/tender, in accordance with the specific programme rules.
5.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information
The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify
questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the
participants.
Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or
publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:
− findings do not match their declarations or statements
− the documents submitted are outdated
− the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or
unclear.
If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right
not to finalise the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and
documents submitted or publicly available).
5.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The ownership control assessment is in principle valid for 18 months. If during this
period the participant applies for another grant or tender and confirms that the
ownership control status has not changed, the supporting documents will not be
requested again.
In this case, the participants will still have to submit the ownership control
declaration with the application, but there will be no check by the Central Validation
Service, unless there are justified grounds to doubt the declaration.
5.4 Modification of the assessment
Changes in the ownership control status need to be communicated to the granting
authority/contracting authority, which will trigger a new assessment by the Central
Validation Service, if needed.
For more information on the ownership control assessment procedure, see the
Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and CEF-DIG restricted calls*.

EU FUNDING & TENDERS PORTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE
1.1 The EU Funding & Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) is an electronic portal and exchange
system managed by the European Commission and used by itself and several
other EU services (together ‘EU’), for the management of EU funding/tenders (i.e.
grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, experts, etc).
1.2 It is currently open to:
− users applying for or managing EU grants, tenders and prizes
− entities entering into EU contribution agreements
− external experts and audit firms appointed to work for the EU in the
context of EU funding programmes
and allows them to:
− register (in the Participant Register or Expert Data Base) and view and
edit their data
− create, revise and submit proposals for funding and tenders
− prepare and sign contracts
− manage their projects and contracts (e.g. submit deliverables, reports
and payment requests)
− for experts: perform their tasks inside the system (evaluation,
monitoring, etc)
− for external audit firms: perform their tasks inside the system (audit
management).
1.3 These Terms and Conditions govern the relation between the following parties:
− the European Commission (as owner of the Portal)
and
− users
in relation to access and use of the Portal.
For the avoidance of doubt, it does not cover the terms and conditions related to
the grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements or expert contracts that
are managed through the Portal; those are governed by their own legal framework
and contractual arrangements.
1.4 Requesting access to the Portal, accessing the Portal or using the Portal signifies
unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
Users will be requested to agree explicitly to the Terms and Conditions on their first
login to the Portal.
For users acting on behalf of organisations, the legal representatives of the
organisations will also be asked to explicitly agree at the moment they appoint their
LEAR/EXAFs (through the ‘declaration of consent’; see below).
3EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Organisations must provide their LEAR/EXAFs, LSIGNs and FSIGNs with a copy of
these Terms and Conditions.
Users are responsible for regularly verifying the applicable Terms and Conditions.
1.5 These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the
European Commission and users, as regards the conditions for access and use of
the Portal.
2. ACCESS TO THE PORTAL
2.1 Users
2.1.1 Access to the public parts of the Portal is open to all users.
2.1.2 Access to the Portal electronic exchange system (EES) is open only to persons
with an EU Login account.
2.1.3 Access rights to certain information and functions in the EES are restricted to
users with specific roles (which are in turn linked to their functions within their
organisation or in relation to a particular
proposal/project/grant/contract/agreement).
2.1.4 Organisations can access the EES only via individual users employed by or
representing them.
2.2 Means of access to the EES — EU Login user account
2.2.1 Users must obtain an EU Login account in accordance with the applicable
procedures.
Users who already have an EU Login account must use that account.
2.2.2 Users guarantee that the information provided for registration for the account is
accurate and complete.
The European Commission has — at any time — the right to verify the accuracy
and validity of the information.
If this reveals any inaccuracy or invalidity, the European Commission has the right
to close the account and suspend or refuse access.
2.2.3 The means of access (i.e. the user name and password) are strictly personal and
users are responsible for safeguarding their confidentiality and security, and
ensuring their appropriate use.
Users undertake to take all steps to prevent any unauthorised third party from
gaining knowledge and making use thereof.
Users may not transfer or sell their means of access to third parties.
Users must notify the European Commission immediately (via the IT Helpdesk;
see Funding & Tenders Portal Support menu) of the loss, theft, breach of
confidentiality or any risk of misuse of the means of access.
If the European Commission has any reason to suspect that the confidentiality or
security of the means of access has been breached or that the EES is being
misused, it may — without prior notice — suspend or refuse access.

2.4 LEAR appointment
2.4.1 Organisations using the EES for transactions requiring electronic signatures are
required to appoint a LEAR.
2.4.2 Individuals (i.e. beneficiaries that are natural persons) will automatically have the

replaced if necessary, following the same appointment process.
2.4.3 Organisations warrant that the person appointed as LEAR is duly authorised to
represent them in relation to all LEAR responsibilities.
Organisations are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of the LEAR
responsibilities and to ensure that the LEAR remains at all times duly authorised
to represent them in relation to these responsibilities.
2.4.4 Supporting documents must be provided directly in the system.
2.4.5 Signed originals must be kept on file for controls (which may take place at any
moment and independently of any ongoing grants, procurements, prizes,
contribution agreements or expert contracts).
9EU Funding & Tenders Portal: Terms and Conditions: 7.0 – 01.02.2024
BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to the closure of the EU Login

2.5.1 The LEAR must appoint one or more LSIGNs and FSIGNs for the organisation.
2.5.2 The LEAR and its organisation warrant that the persons appointed as LSIGNs or
FSIGNs are duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to all LSIGN
or FSIGN responsibilities.
The LEAR and its organisation are responsible for verifying regularly the scope of
the LSIGN and FSIGN responsibilities and to ensure that the LSIGNs and FSIGNs
remain at all times duly authorised to represent the organisation in relation to
these responsibilities.
2.5.3 The CoCo or PaCo must appoint the PLSIGNs and PFSIGNs for individual grants
procurements and contribution agreements from the list of LSIGNs and FSIGNs for
their organisation.
2.6 Data updates on the EES roles
2.6.1 The LEAR is responsible for keeping data related to the organisation roles up-to-
date.
2.6.2 The CoCo/PaCo are responsible for keeping data related to the project roles up-to-
date.

and omissions of persons employed by or representing them, acting as users of
the Portal.
3.1.6 Users are liable for — and will indemnify and hold harmless the European
Commission against — any damage that results from:
− changes made to the Portal or
− use of the Portal in a manner that does not correspond with these Terms and
Conditions.
3.2 Required hardware, software and services
3.2.1 Users acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for the choice, purchase
and operation of hardware, software and telecommunication services required to

minimum requirements, as specified on the Portal (if any).
Users are responsible for the installation and costs of purchasing and licensing
such hardware, software or telecommunication services.

integrity of the data and the accuracy of the date and time of sending or
receiving (as indicated by the EES logs)
(b) a document sent or notified through the EES is considered as equivalent
to a paper document, is admissible as evidence in legal proceedings, is
deemed original and enjoys legal presumption of its authenticity and
integrity, provided it does not contain any dynamic features capable of
automatically changing it

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
3.3.2 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) any communication or document sent or notified using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper document with a handwritten signature and shall be
admissible as evidence in legal proceedings and constitute sufficient
evidence in legal proceedings
(b) any declaration, contract (or amendment) signed using any type of
electronic signature through the EES shall be considered as equivalent
to a paper declaration/contract with a handwritten signature and shall

declaration or contract signed using any type of electronic
signature through the EES or

contract submitted or signed through the EES as evidence in legal
proceedings, solely on the basis that such communication,
document, declaration or contract was submitted electronically
through the EES or signed with an electronic signature.
3.3.3 Users acknowledge and accept that:
(a) communications in the EES are generally considered to have been made
when they are sent by the sending party (i.e. on the date and time they
are sent through the EES, as indicated by the time logs)
(b) where formal notifications are required, these are considered to have
been made when they are received by the receiving party (i.e. on the
date and time they are accessed in the EES by the receiving party, as
indicated by the time logs); formal notifications that have not been
accessed within 10 calendar days after sending are considered to have
been accessed.
3.3.4 The European Commission registers access and use of the EES.
This access and use log provides evidence that access and use has been made of
EES, unless users can prove the contrary.
3.3.5 Electronic messages, connections, operations on the network and transactions
between the EU and the users shall be proven using the logs and transaction files
kept electronically by the European Commission.
Users accept the evidential value of this data.
This does not prevent the parties from providing other proof, using permitted
legal methods (such as proof on paper).
3.4 Intellectual property rights
3.4.1 The intellectual and industrial property rights and know-how associated with the
Portal belong exclusively to the European Commission and its licensors.
Only the European Commission has the right to correct errors.

3.4.2 The European Commission grants users a non-transferable, limited, non-exclusive
licence to use the Portal for their own professional purposes (unless access is
suspended or refused).
Without prejudice to the rights of users under applicable legislation relating to the
protection of computer programs (which cannot be contractually denied), users
may not in any way:
(a) modify, translate or adapt the Portal
(b) decompile or disassemble the Portal
(c) copy the Portal (or parts of it)
(d) pass on, dispose of, grant as a sub-licence, lease, lend or distribute the

The European Commission does not guarantee that the Portal will be available
without interruption or degradation of service.
In case of technical problems affecting the submission of application documents,
the European Commission reserves the right to cancel calls without entitlement to
compensation.
3.6 Suspension and refusal of access
3.6.1 Users acknowledge that the European Commission may refuse access to a user
logging in, if a session is already open on another computer where another user is
using the same means of access (i.e. the same EU Login account name and
password).
3.6.2 Users acknowledge and accept that the European Commission may suspend or
refuse access to the Portal:
(a) in case of suspected or actual breach of these Terms and Conditions
(b) if the information provided for the registration for an EU Login account is
inaccurate or invalid (clause 2.2.2)

confidentiality or security of the means of access (i.e. EU Login account
name and password) have been breached or compromised or that the
Portal is being misused (clause 2.2.3)
(d) in case of fraudulent practices
(e) if the IT systems of the European Commission are being attacked
(f) if required under applicable laws or regulations
(g) to avoid any detrimental impact for the European Commission or a user

(h) for preventive, corrective or routine maintenance and
(i) in any other situation where the European Commission considers that
suspension or refusal of access is reasonably required or desirable.

the suspension or refusal of access.
4. MISCELLANEOUS
4.1 Personal data
4.1.1 Personal data submitted or otherwise collected through the Portal is subject to the

4.3.1 Users may be held liable for misuse of the Portal under the conditions set out in

4.3.2 In addition to clauses 3.2.2 and 3.6.3 and to the maximum extent permitted by
the applicable law (see clause 4.7.2), neither the European Commission nor any
other EU service shall be liable for any direct or indirect damage of any kind
(including disruption of business, third party claims and loss of profits, anticipated
savings, or goodwill), except in the event of wilful misconduct.
To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, neither the European
Commission nor any other EU service can be held liable for gross negligence.
Neither the European Commission nor any other EU service are responsible or
liable for any damage in case of force majeure, external cause or any other events
which are not under their reasonable control.
4.4 Interpretation
4.4.1 These Terms and Conditions have been drawn up in English and its provisions will
be interpreted and construed in accordance with applicable law (see clause 4.6)
and their generally accepted meanings in the English language.
Any translation of these Terms and Conditions is for the convenience of the
parties only, and shall not be binding towards any party.
In the event of any inconsistency between the English original and its translation,
the provisions of the English version shall prevail.
4.4.2 For participants that are international organisations, nothing in these Terms and
Conditions shall constitute, be deemed or construed as a waiver or modification of
their privileges or immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or
international law.

BG CS DA DE EL EN ES ET FI FR GA HR HU IT LT LV MT NL PL PT RO SK SL SV
4.4.3 International organisations that have also concluded a financial framework
partnership agreement with the EU, may moreover rely on the provisions set out
in that framework agreement— provided they do not call into question the lawful
access and use of the Portal in line with the intended purposes set out in the
Terms and Conditions.
4.4.4 If a provision of these Terms and Conditions is or becomes invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, it shall (if possible and insofar as it is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) be replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable clause that reflects
the initial intentions as closely as possible.
If the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision cannot be validly replaced, no
effect is to be given to the clause and it shall be deemed not to be included in
these Terms and Conditions, without affecting or invalidating the remaining
provisions of these Terms and Conditions.
4.5 Changes
4.5.1 The European Commission may, at any time, vary, add to or delete any provision
of these Terms and Conditions.
4.5.2 Users acknowledge and agree that such new terms and conditions enter into force
with their publication on the Portal.
4.5.3 In accordance with clause 1.4, any access to or use of the Portal shall constitute
unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions (in the then-current

Conditions shall be deemed accepted by them as from the first time they access
or use the Portal after the date of entry into force of the new Terms and

General Annexes
INTRODUCTION
These General Annexes set out the general conditions applicable to calls and topics for grants
and other forms of funding under the Horizon Europe main work programme. They also
describe the evaluation and award procedures and other criteria for Horizon Europe funding.
In particular, the General Annexes outline the:
– admissibility and eligibility criteria for participation and for receiving funding, the
criteria for having the financial and operational capacity and for exclusion (Annexes
A-C);
– award criteria, mandatory documents and evaluation procedure (Annexes D-F);
– legal and financial set-up of the grant agreements (Annex G);
– specific conditions applying to actions which include pre-commercial procurement or
procurement of innovative solutions (Annex H).
If a topic deviates from the general conditions or includes additional conditions, this is
explicitly stated under the specific conditions for the topic.
Applicants are invited to read the call documentation on the topic page of the Funding &
Tenders Portal (‘Portal’) carefully, and particularly these General Annexes, the Horizon
Europe Programme Guide1, the EU Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual2 and the EU
Grants AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement3. These documents provide clarifications and
answers to questions on preparing the application.
Please note that calls launched by the European Research Council (ERC), the European
Innovation Council (EIC), the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the
Institutionalised European Partnerships based on Articles 185 and 187 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), calls under the Euratom Research and Training
Programme and the activities of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) are
subject to separate work programmes and thus not covered by these General Annexes.
1 The Horizon Europe Programme Guide outlines the detailed guidance on the structure, budget and political
priorities of Horizon Europe.
2 The Online Manual outlines the procedures to register and submit applications online via the EU Funding &
Tenders Portal and recommendations on preparing the application.
3 The AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement contains detailed annotations on all the provisions in the grant
agreement that must be signed to obtain the grant.

General Annexes
GENERAL CONDITIONS
A — Admissibility
Admissibility
Applications must be submitted before the call deadline.
Applications must be submitted electronically via the Funding & Tenders Portal electronic
submission system (accessible via the topic page in the Search Funding & Tenders section).
Paper submissions are NOT possible.
Applications must be submitted using the forms provided inside the electronic submission
system (not the templates available on the topic page, which are only for information). The
structure and presentation must correspond to the instructions given in the forms.
Applications must be complete and contain all parts and mandatory Annexes and supporting
documents (see Annex E below).
Applications must be readable, accessible and printable.
Applications must include a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results
including communication activities, unless provided otherwise in the specific call/topic
conditions. The plan is not required for applications at the first stage of two-stage procedures.
If the expected exploitation of the results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and
marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan must include a
strategy for such exploitation. If the plan provides for exploitation of the results primarily in
non-associated third countries, the applicants must explain how that exploitation is to be
considered in the EU’s interest.
Applicants submitting a proposal under the blind evaluation pilot (see Annex F below) must
not disclose their organisation names, acronyms, logos nor names of personnel in Part B of
their first-stage application (see Annex E below).
Page limits
In addition to the above admissibility conditions, page limits will apply to parts of
applications. The page limits, and sections subject to limits, will be clearly shown in the
application templates in the Funding & Tenders Portal electronic submission system.
Unless provided otherwise in the specific call/topic conditions, the limit for a full
application is 45 pages (except for ‘Coordination and support’ actions, where the limit is 30
pages, and for ‘Programme co-fund’ actions, where the limit is 70 pages). For topics using
lump sum funding, the limit for ‘Research and Innovation’ actions and ‘Innovation’ actions is
50 pages and the limit for ‘Coordination and support’ action is 33 pages.
The limit for a first-stage application is 10 pages.
Page 4 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
If an application exceeds the limits, there will be an automatic warning and invitation to re-
submit a version that conforms to these limits. After the call deadline, excess pages will be
automatically made invisible, and will not be taken into consideration by the evaluators.
B — Eligibility
Entities eligible to participate
Any legal entity, regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from non-
associated third countries or international organisations (including international European
research organisations4) is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for funding or not),
provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe Regulation5 have been met,
along with any other conditions laid down in the specific call/topic.
A ‘legal entity’ means any natural or legal person created and recognised as such under
national law, EU law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting
in its own name, exercise rights and be subject to obligations, or an entity without legal
personality6.
Beneficiaries and affiliated entities must register in the Participant Register before submitting
their application, in order to get a participant identification code (PIC) and be validated by the
Central Validation Service before signing the grant agreement. For the validation, they will be
asked to upload the necessary documents showing their legal status and origin during the
grant preparation stage. A validated PIC is not a prerequisite for submitting an application.
For more information, see Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Specific cases:
Affiliated entities — Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link to a
beneficiary7 which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the
beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become
beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
Associated partners — Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action
without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim
contributions) are allowed, subject to any specific call/topic conditions.
Entities without legal personality — Entities which do not have legal personality under their
national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their representatives have the
4 ‘International European research organisation’ means an international organisation, the majority of whose
members are Member States or Associated Countries, and whose principal objective is to promote scientific and
technological cooperation in Europe.
5 Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing
Horizon Europe (OJ L 170 , 12.5.2021, p. 1).
6 See Article 197(2)(c) EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.

capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and offer guarantees to protect the
EU’s financial interests equivalent to those offered by legal persons8.
EU bodies — Legal entities created under EU law including decentralised agencies may be
part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
Joint Research Centre (‘JRC’)— Where provided for in the specific call/topic conditions,
applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the JRC but the JRC
will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Applicants will indicate
the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based on the scope of the topic text.
After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium selected for funding may come to an
agreement on the specific terms of the participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the
JRC may accede to the grant agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate
as an associated partner, and would accede to the consortium as a member.
Associations and interest groupings — Entities composed of members (e.g. European
research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole beneficiaries’ or
‘beneficiaries without legal personality’9. However, if the action is in practice implemented
by the individual members, those members should also participate either as beneficiaries or as
affiliated entities (otherwise their costs will NOT be eligible).
Restrictions on participation in Innovation Actions — In accordance with the 2019 “EU-
China - A Strategic outlook” communication, the 2021 “Global Approach to Research and
Innovation” communication, and the joint conclusions of the 4th EU-China Innovation
Cooperation Dialogue of 2019, an exercise to develop a Joint Roadmap for the future of EU-
China cooperation in science, technology, and innovation (Roadmap) has been established
between the EU and China. It has the objective to develop a level playing field for
engagement between the EU and China in the areas of science, technology, and innovation
(STI) that is respectful of fundamental research and innovation values and principles. This
endeavor is to be achieved through an agreement on the framework conditions contained in
the Roadmap and their monitoring and evaluation. As progress so far has mainly taken place
on the framework conditions linked to research rather than on those related to innovation, and
taking into account the nature and objectives in particular of Innovation Actions, cooperation
with entities established in China needs to be calibrated accordingly.
Legal entities established in China are therefore not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe
Innovation Actions in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated
entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or
recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-
by-case basis for justified reasons. The above eligibility criteria may be reviewed in the future
in accordance with policy developments. This exclusion is justified under Article 22(6) of the
Horizon Europe Regulation given the substantive concerns regarding the use of intellectual
property generated under this publicly funded programme, and the ongoing discussions

Restrictions for the protection of European communication networks — The protection
of European communication networks has been identified as an important security interest of
the Union and its Member States.10 In line with the Commission Recommendation on the
cybersecurity of 5G networks of 201911 and the subsequent report on EU coordinated risk
assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G networks of 2019, 12 the EU Toolbox on 5G
cybersecurity,13 the second report on Member States’ progress in implementing the EU
toolbox on 5G cybersecurity of 2023,14 and the related Communication on the implementation
of the 5G cybersecurity toolbox of 2023,15 the Commission together with the Member States
has worked to jointly identify and assess cyberthreats and security risks for 5G networks.16
The toolbox also recommends adding country-specific information (e.g. threat assessment
from national security services, etc.). This work is an essential component of the Security
Union Strategy and supports the protection of electronic communications networks and other
critical infrastructures.
Entities assessed as “high-risk suppliers”, are currently set out in the second report on
Member States’ progress in implementing the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity of 202317 and
the related Communication on the implementation of the 5G cybersecurity toolbox of 202318.
The toolbox also underlines that further developing European capacities in the area of 5G and
post-5G technologies by leveraging EU Research & Innovation Funding programmes is a
strategic risk mitigating measure. This entails the need to avoid the participation of high-risk
supplier entities in the development of other technologies linked to the evolution of European
communication networks to prevent technology transfer and the persistence of dependencies
in materials, semiconductor components (including processors), computing resources,
software tools and virtualisation technologies, as well as related cybersecurity.
In order to protect the specific policy requirements of the Union and/or its Member States, it
is therefore appropriate that the following additional eligibility criteria apply to actions
identified as “subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication networks”
and to proposals within the MSCA part 19 that concern the evolution of European
communication networks (5G, post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of
European communication networks):

General Annexes
Entities that are assessed as high-risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment
(and any entities they own or control) are not eligible to participate as beneficiaries, affiliated
entities and associated partners.
The assessment is based on the following criteria:
• likelihood of interference from a non-associated third country, for example due to:
− the characteristics of the entity’s ownership or governance (e.g. state-owned or
controlled, government/party involvement);
− the characteristics of the entity’s business and other conduct (e.g. a strong link to a
third country government);
− the characteristics of the respective third country (e.g. legislation or government
practices likely to affect the implementation of the action, including an offensive
cyber/intelligence policy, pressure regarding place of manufacturing or access to
information).
• (cyber-)security practices, including throughout the entire supply chain;
• risks identified in relevant assessments of Member States and third countries as well as
other EU institutions, bodies and agencies, if relevant.
Exceptions may be requested from the granting authority and will be assessed case-by-case,
taking into account the criteria provided for in the 5G cybersecurity toolbox, the security risks
and availability of alternatives in the context of the action.
Restrictions on participation or control — For actions related to EU strategic assets,
interests, autonomy or security, the specific topic conditions may limit participation to legal
entities established only in EU Member States or in EU Member States and specific
associated or non-associated third countries. In this case, the eligible countries will be
identified in the specific call/topic conditions. In addition, for duly justified and exceptional
reasons, to guarantee protection of the strategic interests of the EU and its Member States, the
specific call/topic conditions may also exclude the participation of legal entities directly or
indirectly controlled by non-eligible third countries or by legal entities of non-eligible third
countries (or make their participation subject to specific conditions), in line with Article 22(5)
of the Horizon Europe Regulation.
EU restrictive measures — Entities subject to EU restrictive measures under Article 29 of
the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of
the EU (TFEU)20 as well as Article 75 TFEU21, are not eligible to participate in any capacity,
including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind
contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).

General Annexes
Special rules also apply to entities covered by Commission Guidelines No 2013/C 205/0522.
Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government controlled territories
of Ukraine — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of
Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions
foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-
government controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not
subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any
capacity23. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners,
third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to
third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the
rule of law in Hungary — Following the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2506,
as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be entered into with Hungarian public
interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain.
Affected entities may continue to apply to calls for proposals. However, as long as the
Council measures are not lifted, such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role
(beneficiaries, affiliated entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third
parties, etc). In case of multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or
replace that entity and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and budget may be
redistributed accordingly.

Legal entities which are established in countries not listed above will be eligible for funding if
provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered
essential for implementing the action by the granting authority.
Specific cases:
Affiliated entities — Affiliated entities are eligible for funding if they are established in one
of the countries listed above, or in a country identified in the specific call/topic conditions.
Associated partners — Entities not eligible for funding (and therefore not able to participate
as beneficiaries) may participate as associated partners, unless specified otherwise in the
specific call/topic conditions.
Coordination and Support Actions – To be eligible to participate as beneficiaries (or
affiliated entities) in ‘Coordination and support’ actions, legal entities must be established in a
Member State or Associated Country, unless the specific call/topic conditions provide
otherwise (in which case the general rules for eligibility for funding apply). Legal entities
established in a non-associated third country may, however, participate in ‘Coordination and
support’ actions as associated partners, unless this is explicitly excluded by the specific
call/topic conditions.
EU bodies — Legal entities created under EU law may also be eligible to receive funding,
unless their basic act states otherwise.
International organisations — International European research organisations are eligible to
receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member State or
Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’ actions or
when provided for in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international organisations are
not eligible to receive funding, unless provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, or if
their participation is considered essential for implementing the action by the granting
authority.
Consortium composition
Unless otherwise provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, only legal entities forming
a consortium are eligible to participate in actions provided that the consortium includes, as

General Annexes
beneficiaries, three legal entities independent from each other and each established in a
different country as follows:
− at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
− at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different Member
States or Associated Countries.
As affiliated entities do not sign the grant agreement, they do not count towards the minimum
eligibility criteria for consortium composition (if any).
The Joint Research Centre, international European research organisations and legal entities
created under EU law are deemed to be established in a Member State other than those in
which the other legal entities participating in the action are established.
Applications for ‘Training and mobility’ actions and for ‘Programme co-fund’ actions may be
submitted by one or more legal entities, provided that one of those legal entities is established
in a Member State or an Associated Country.
Applications for ‘Coordination and support’ actions may be submitted by one or more legal
entities, which may be established in a Member State, Associated Country or, in exceptional
cases and if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, in another third country.
Applications for ‘Pre-commercial procurement’ actions and ‘Public procurement of
innovative solutions’ actions must also fulfil the eligibility criteria of three independent legal
entities as beneficiaries as explained above, out of which a minimum of two beneficiaries
must be independent legal entities that are public procurers29, each established in a different
Member State or Associated Country and with at least one of them established in a Member
State.
Eligible activities
Eligible activities are the ones described in the call conditions. Applications will only be
considered eligible if their content corresponds, wholly or in part, to the topic description for
which it is submitted.
Projects must focus exclusively on civil applications and must not:
– aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes;
– intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such changes
heritable (except for research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads, which may be
financed);
– intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research, or for the purpose
of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer.
29 ‘Public procurers’ are organisations that are contracting authorities or contracting entities as defined in EU
public procurement directives 2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU, and 2009/81/E.
Page 12 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Projects must, moreover, comply with EU policy interests and priorities (environment, social,
security, industrial policy, etc.).
The following activities are generally eligible for grants under Horizon Europe:
Research and innovation actions (RIA) — Activities that aim primarily to establish new
knowledge or to explore the feasibility of a new or improved technology, product, process,
service or solution. This may include basic and applied research, technology development and
integration, testing, demonstration and validation of a small-scale prototype in a laboratory or
simulated environment.
Innovation actions (IA) — Activities that aim directly to produce plans and arrangements or
designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services. These activities may
include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, large-scale product validation and
market replication.
Coordination and support actions (CSA) — Activities that contribute to the objectives of
Horizon Europe. This excludes research and innovation (R&I) activities, except those carried
out under the ‘Widening participation and spreading excellence’ component of the
programme (part of ‘Widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area’).
Also eligible are bottom-up coordination actions which promote cooperation between legal
entities from Member States and Associated Countries to strengthen the European Research
Area, and which receive no EU co-funding for research activities.
Programme co-fund actions (CoFund) — A programme of activities established or
implemented by legal entities managing or funding R&I programmes, other than EU funding
bodies. Such a programme of activities may support: networking and coordination; research;
innovation; pilot actions; innovation and market deployment; training and mobility;
awareness raising and communication; and dissemination and exploitation. It may also
provide any relevant financial support, such as grants, prizes and procurement, as well as
Horizon Europe blended finance30 or a combination thereof. The actions may be implemented
by the beneficiaries directly or by providing financial support to third parties.
Innovation and market deployment actions (IMDA) — Activities that embed an innovation
action and other activities necessary to deploy an innovation on the market. This includes the
scaling-up of companies and Horizon Europe blended finance.
Training and mobility actions (TMA) — Activities that aim to improve the skills, knowledge

General Annexes
possibly, the first deployment of new solutions that can significantly improve quality and
efficiency in areas of public interest, while opening market opportunities for industry and
researchers active in Europe. Eligible activities include the preparation, management and
follow-up, under the coordination of a lead procurer, of one joint PCP and additional activities
to embed the PCP into a wider set of demand-side activities.
Public procurement of innovative solutions actions (PPI) — Activities that aim to
strengthen the ability of a transnational buyers’ group to deploy innovative solutions early by
overcoming the fragmentation of demand for such solutions and sharing the risks and costs of
acting as early adopters, while opening market opportunities for industry. Eligible activities
include preparing and implementing, under the coordination of a lead procurer, one joint or
several coordinated PPI by the buyers’ group and additional activities to embed the PPI into a
wider set of demand-side activities.
Technology Readiness Levels
Where the specific call/topic conditions require a Technology Readiness Level (TRL), the
following definitions apply, unless otherwise specified:
– TRL 1 — Basic principles observed
– TRL 2 — Technology concept formulated
– TRL 3 — Experimental proof of concept
– TRL 4 — Technology validated in a lab
– TRL 5 — Technology validated in a relevant environment (industrially relevant
environment in the case of key enabling technologies)
– TRL 6 — Technology demonstrated in a relevant environment (industrially relevant
environment in the case of key enabling technologies)
– TRL 7 — System prototype demonstration in an operational environment
– TRL 8 — System complete and qualified
– TRL 9 — Actual system proven in an operational environment (competitive
manufacturing in the case of key enabling technologies, or in space)
Ethics
Projects must comply with ethical principles (including the highest standards of research
integrity) and applicable EU, international and national law.
Applicants must have completed the ethics self-assessment as part of their application.
For more information, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment.
Page 14 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Projects involving ethics issues will have to undergo an ethics review to authorise funding and
may be made subject to specific ethics requirements. These requirements become part of the
grant agreement as ethics deliverables, e.g. ethics committee opinions/authorisations required
under national or EU law.
Security — EU classified and sensitive information
Projects involving classified and/or sensitive information will have to go through the security
appraisal process to authorise funding and may be made subject to specific security rules
(detailed in the Security Section, which is annexed to the grant agreement). Specific
provisions for EU classified information (EUCI) and sensitive information (SEN) will be
included in the grant agreement, as necessary and appropriate.
The rules for protecting EU classified information (governed by Commission Decision (EU,
Euratom) 2015/44431 and/or national rules) provide for instance that:
− projects involving information classified as TRES SECRET UE/EU TOP SECRET (or
equivalent) can NOT be funded;
− EU classified information must be marked in accordance with the applicable security
instructions in the Security Classification Guide appendix of the Security Aspects
Letter (SAL), which is contained in the Security Section of the grant agreement;
− generation of, or access to, information with classification levels CONFIDENTIEL
UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL or above (and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, if
required by national rules) may take place only on the premises of entities which have
been granted a facility security clearance (FSC) issued by the competent national
security authority (NSA);
− handling of information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL or
above (and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, if required by national rules) may
take place only in a secured area accredited by the competent NSA;
− access to and handling of information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU
CONFIDENTIAL or above may be granted only to individuals with a valid personnel
security clearance (PSC) and an established need-to-know, who have been briefed on
the applicable security rules;
− access to, and handling of, information classified RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED
may be granted only to individuals who have a need-to-know and have been briefed
on the applicable security rules;
− at the end of the grant, the classified information must either be returned or continue to
be protected according to the applicable rules;
31 See Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p. 53).
Page 15 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
− subcontracting of tasks involving EU classified information is subject to prior written
approval by the European Commission, which is the originator of EU classified
information. It is only possible to subcontract these tasks to entities established in an
EU Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of information agreement
with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the Commission);
− disclosure of EU classified information is subject to prior written approval by the
European Commission.
Depending on the type of activity, FSCs may have to be provided before the grant is signed.
The granting authority will assess this for each case and fix the delivery date during the grant
preparation stage. It is not possible to sign any grant agreement before at least one of the
beneficiaries in the consortium has an FSC.
In certain cases, the project results might not require classification, but they might be sensitive
and require restricted disclosure or limited dissemination for security reasons, according to the
applicable instructions in the Security Section. This means that, in principle, third parties
should have no access to results subject to this type of restriction. Disclosure of this
information is subject to prior written approval by the European Commission.
Further security recommendations may be added to the grant agreement in the form of
security deliverables (e.g. establishing a security advisory board, appointing a project security
officer, limiting the level of detail, using a fake scenario, etc.).
In addition, beneficiaries must ensure that their projects are not subject to national/third-
country security requirements that could affect implementation or put into question the award
of the grants (e.g. technology restrictions, national security classification, etc.). Any potential
security issues must be notified immediately to the granting authority.
Gender equality plans and gender mainstreaming
Beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities between men and women
in implementing the action and, where applicable, in line with their gender equality plan.
They must aim to achieve, to the extent possible, a gender balance at all levels of personnel
assigned to the action, including at supervisory and managerial level.
In addition, to be eligible, legal entities from Member States and Associated Countries that
are public bodies, research organisations or higher education establishments (including private
research organisations and higher education establishments) must have a gender equality plan,
covering the following minimum process-related requirements:
– publication: a formal document published on the institution’s website and signed by
the top management;
– dedicated resources: commitment of resources and expertise in gender equality to
implement the plan;
Page 16 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
– data collection and monitoring: sex/gender disaggregated data on personnel (and
students, for the establishments concerned) and annual reporting based on indicators;
– training: awareness raising/training on gender equality and unconscious gender biases
for staff and decision-makers.
Content-wise, it is recommended that the gender equality plan addresses the following areas,
using concrete measures and targets:
– work-life balance and organisational culture;
– gender balance in leadership and decision-making;
– gender equality in recruitment and career progression;
– integration of the gender dimension into research and teaching content;
– measures against gender-based violence, including sexual harassment.
A self-declaration will be requested at proposal stage. If all the above-mentioned mandatory
requirements are met through another strategic document, such as a development plan or an
inclusion or diversity strategy, it can be considered as an equivalent. This eligibility criterion
does not apply to other categories of legal entities, such as private for-profit organisations,
including SMEs, non-governmental or civil society organisations.
Financial support to third parties
Where the specific call/topic conditions allow for financial support to third parties, the
applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected results,
including the elements listed in the application template. The following conditions must also
be fulfilled:
– projects must publish their open calls widely and adhere to EU standards of
transparency, equal treatment, conflict of interest and confidentiality;
– all calls for third parties and all calls that are implemented by third parties must be
published on the Funding & Tenders Portal, and on the beneficiaries’ websites;
– the calls must remain open for at least 2 months;
– if submission deadlines are changed, this must immediately be announced and
registered applicants must be informed of the change;
– projects must publish the outcome of the calls without delay, including a description
of third-party projects, the date of the award, the duration, and the legal name of the
third party and country of establishment;
– the calls must have a clear European dimension.
Further conditions may be stipulated in the specific conditions for the topic.

General Annexes
OTHER TYPES OF ACTIONS AND FORMS OF FUNDING
The following types of action and forms of funding are also used in Horizon Europe. They are usually placed in the
‘Other Actions’ section of the work programme parts and are not all subject to calls for proposals.
• Grants to identified beneficiaries — Exceptionally, a grant may be awarded to legal entities explicitly named
in the work programme without a prior call for proposals. The identified beneficiaries must nevertheless submit
a proposal to benefit from funding. This proposal will be evaluated and must meet the required threshold. The
funding rates will correspond to the type of action indicated.
• Prizes — Prize means a financial contribution given as a reward following a contest. Inducement prizes: a prize
to stimulate investment in a given area, by specifying a goal prior to the work being performed. Contests for
inducement prizes must address technological and/or societal challenges. The award criteria will define a goal,
but without prescribing how to achieve it. Contests for inducement prizes are split into awards for the contestant
that first meets the specific goal defined in the rules of the contest, and awards for the best contestant within a
given period. Recognition prizes: a prize to reward past achievements and outstanding work after it has been
performed. Recognition prizes must help to raise public awareness of EU policies, create role models and
support best practice exchange. The Rules of the contest of a specific prize provide for the admissibility,
eligibility, exclusion and award criteria, the prize amount and categories (if applicable) the evaluation
procedure, the indicative timetable and the modalities of payment. The rules are found on the call topic page on
the Funding & Tenders Portal.
• Framework partnerships and specific grant agreements — Framework partnerships are formalised long-
term cooperation mechanisms involving several or recurring grants. They must be based on jointly agreed action
plans and agreements that set out the terms and conditions for receiving grants to implement the actions,
framework partnership agreements (FPA) and specific grant agreements (SGA). The FPA will set out the
framework conditions governing potential grants to beneficiaries on the basis of an action plan and jointly
agreed general objectives. The SGA will set out the specific obligations and conditions to implement the
specific action. The FPA will have no budget; the budget and rules on funding will be set out in each SGA and
depend on the specific type of action. The establishment of an FPA must take place following a call for
proposals. Beneficiaries will be identified from the evaluation of the proposals. In a subsequent step,
beneficiaries may be invited to submit their proposals for the SGA. Framework partnerships do not give the
partners (i.e. potential beneficiaries) exclusive rights to be awarded the grants covered by the FPAs. SGAs must
only be signed if the FPA has been signed, and before the end date of the FPA.
• Operating grants — Operating grants provide financial support for the functioning of a body to enable it to
carry out specific activities set out in the agreed work programme. Operating grants do not support the
implementation of a specific action, but rather the annual operating budget (or part of it) for certain bodies
whose statutory activities serve the strategic objectives of EU policies. Operating grants will always be mono-
beneficiary grants supporting the work programme of only one organisation. Operating grants must follow the
same rules as described in Annex G, but they do not differentiate between direct and indirect costs. Receiving
an operating grant may make beneficiaries ineligible to receive indirect costs in all other EU action grants.
• Public procurement — In a public procurement action, the granting authority purchases works, supplies or
services, or acquires or rents land, buildings or other immovable property. This is done by entering into a
contract with an economic operator chosen by the granting authority. Before the granting authority enters into a
procurement contract, a call for tender is published on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
• Expert contract actions — Expert contracts are used to appoint independent expert(s) to advise or assist us.
Experts are used for evaluating proposals, for evaluating the programme, for ethics screenings and assessments,
for advisory bodies, and for expertise related to the objectives of Horizon Europe.
• Subscription actions — Subscription actions are used to pay contributions to bodies in which the EU is a
member or an observer.
• Scientific and technical services by the Joint Research Centre — Scientific and technical services cover
research and innovation activities undertaken by the Commission through its Joint Research Centre. These (non-
nuclear) activities are direct actions generating high-quality scientific evidence to support efficient and
affordable public policies. Horizon Europe’s rules for participation do not apply to these actions.
• Indirectly managed actions — Indirectly managed actions refer to actions implemented by entities which are
entrusted with implementing EU funds or budgetary guarantees through a contribution agreement.
• Service level agreement actions — These are actions implemented through a service level agreement. Service
level agreements include agreements between Commission departments or, agreements that the Commission
may conclude with another Union institution, Union body, or European office involving the provision of
services.

General Annexes
C — Financial and operational capacity and exclusion
Financial capacity
Applicants must have stable and sufficient resources to successfully implement the projects
and contribute their share. Organisations participating in several projects must have sufficient
capacity to implement all these projects.
The financial capacity check will be done on the basis of the documents uploaded in the
Participant Register during the grant preparation stage (e.g. profit and loss account and
balance sheet, business plan, audit report produced by an approved external auditor, certifying
the accounts for the last closed financial year, etc.). The analysis will be based on neutral
financial indicators, but will also take into account other aspects, such as dependency on EU
funding and deficit and revenue in previous years.
The check will normally be done for the coordinator if the requested grant amount is equal to
or greater than EUR 500 000, except for:
− public bodies (entities established as a public body under national law, including local,
regional or national authorities) or international organisations; and
− cases where the individual requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60 000 (low-
value grant).
If needed, it may also be done for the other applicants, including affiliated entities. If the
financial capacity is structurally guaranteed by another legal entity, the financial capacity of
that legal entity will be verified.
If the granting authority considers that the financial capacity is not satisfactory, they may
require:
− further information;
− an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility of
affiliated entities (see Annex G below); and
− prefinancing paid in instalments;
or
− propose no prefinancing;
− request that the applicant concerned is replaced or, if needed, reject the entire
proposal.
For more information, see Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Page 20 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Operational capacity
Applicants must have the know-how, qualifications and resources to successfully
implement their tasks in the project and contribute their share (including, when appropriate,
sufficient experience in EU/transnational projects of comparable size).
This assessment of operational capacity will be carried out during the evaluation of the award
criterion ‘Quality and efficiency of the implementation’. It will be based on the competence
and experience of the applicants and their project teams, including their operational resources
(human, technical and other) or, exceptionally, the measures proposed to obtain the necessary
competence and experience by the time the tasks are implemented.
If the evaluation of this award criterion leads to a score above the applicable threshold, then
the applicants are considered to have sufficient operational capacity.
For this assessment, applicants will be required to provide the following information in the
application form:
− description of the consortium participants; and
− for each participant:
– identity of researchers involved in the proposal (through the researchers table);
– up to five most relevant publications, widely-used datasets, software, goods,
services, or any other achievements relevant to the call content;
– up to five most relevant previous projects or activities, connected to the subject
of this proposal; and
– description of any significant infrastructure and/or any major items of technical
equipment, relevant to the proposed work.
Additional supporting documents may be requested if they are needed to confirm the
operational capacity of any applicant.
Public bodies, Member State organisations and international organisations are exempted from
the operational capacity check.
Exclusion
Applicants that are subject to EU administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion)32 or are in one of
the following exclusion situations33 that bar them from receiving EU grants can NOT
participate:
32 See Article 136 EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.

creditors, suspended business activities or other similar procedures (including
procedures for persons with unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts);
− they are in breach of social security or tax obligations (including if done by persons
with unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts);
− they are guilty of grave professional misconduct (including if done by persons having
powers of representation, decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons
who are essential for the award/implementation of the grant);
− they are guilty of fraud, corruption, having links to a criminal organisation, money
laundering, terrorism-related crimes (including terrorism financing), child labour or
human trafficking (including if done by persons having powers of representation,
decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the
award/implementation of the grant);
− they have shown significant deficiencies in complying with their main obligations
under an EU procurement contract, grant agreement, prize, expert contract, or similar
(including if done by persons having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the award/implementation
of the grant);
− they are guilty of irregularities within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation No
2988/9534 (including if done by persons having powers of representation, decision-
making or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the
award/implementation of the grant); or
− they have created under a different jurisdiction an entity with the intent to circumvent
fiscal, social or other legal obligations in the country of origin or created another entity
with this purpose (including if done by persons having powers of representation,
decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the
award/implementation of the grant).
Applicants will also be refused if they35:
− have misrepresented the information required as a condition for participating in the
procedure or have failed to supply that information; or
− were previously involved in the preparation of documents used in the award procedure
where this entails a breach of the principle of equality of treatment, including
distortion of competition, that cannot be remedied otherwise.

Scores and weighting
Evaluation scores will be awarded for the criteria, and not for the different aspects listed in the
table. For full applications, each criterion will be scored out of 5. The threshold for individual
criteria will be 3. The overall threshold, applying to the sum of the three individual scores,
will be 10.
To determine the ranking for ‘Innovation actions’, the score for ‘Impact’ will be given a
weight of 1.5.
Proposals that pass the individual threshold AND the overall threshold will be considered for
funding, within the limits of the available call budget. Other proposals will be rejected.
Two-stage calls
For the evaluation of first-stage applications under a two-stage submission procedure, only the
‘Excellence’ and ‘Impact’ criteria will be evaluated. Within these criteria, only the aspects in
bold will be considered.
The threshold for both individual criteria will be 4. For each indicative budget-split in the call
conditions, the overall threshold applying to the sum of the two individual scores will be set at
a level that ensures the total requested budget of proposals admitted to stage 2 is as close as
possible to three times the available budget, and not less than two and a half times the
available budget. The actual level will therefore depend on the volume of proposals received.
The threshold is expected normally to be set at 8 or 8.5.
The evaluation procedure is explained further in Annex F below.
Page 26 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
E — Documents
Submission
All proposals must be submitted electronically via the Funders & Tenders Portal electronic
submission system (accessible via the topic page in the Search Funding & Tenders section).
Paper submissions are NOT possible.
Proposals must be complete and contain all parts and mandatory annexes and supporting
documents.
The application form will have two parts:
– Part A (to be filled in directly online) contains administrative information about the
applicant organisations (future coordinator and beneficiaries and affiliated entities),
the summarised budget for the proposal and call-specific questions;
– Part B (to be downloaded from the Portal submission system, completed and then
assembled and re-uploaded as a PDF in the system) contains the technical description
of the project.
Annexes and supporting documents will be directly available in the submission system and
must be uploaded as PDF files (or other formats allowed by the system).
Proposals should be designed to stay as close as possible to the award criteria (see Annex D
above). The application form will help to achieve this.
When submitting the proposal, the coordinator will have to confirm that they have the
mandate to act for all applicants. Moreover, they will have to confirm that the information in
the application is correct and complete and that all participants comply with the conditions for
receiving EU funding (especially eligibility, financial and operational capacity, exclusion,
etc.). Proposals not complying with these requirements will be rejected. Before signing the
grant, each participant will have to confirm this again by signing a declaration of honour.
For lump sum grants proposals, the estimated budget must be described in a detailed budget
table. This will be used as a basis for justifying and/or fixing the lump sum amount. As the
lump sum must be an approximation of the costs actually incurred, the costs included in this
detailed budget table must comply with the basic eligibility conditions for EU actual cost
grants (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, Article 6). This is particularly important for
purchases and subcontracting, which must ensure best value for money (or, if appropriate, the
lowest price) and be free from any conflicts of interest. If the budget table contains ineligible
costs, the grants may be reduced (even later on during implementation of the project or after
they end). Exceptionally, the Decision authorising the use of lump sum funding for a specific
action might specify that a detailed budget table is not required.
Applicants may be asked at a later stage for further documents (for legal entity validation,
financial capacity check, bank account validation, etc.).

General Annexes
F — Procedure
Evaluation procedure and ranking
Calls may be subject to either a single-stage submission procedure or a two-stage
submission procedure. The evaluation procedure may be organised in one (standard) or
several steps.
In the first stage of a two-stage submission, applicants will be requested to submit only an
outline application (which will be evaluated against only two award criteria: ‘Excellence’ and
‘Impact’). Successful applicants will be invited to submit a full application for the second
stage (which will be evaluated against the full set of award criteria).
Proposals will be checked for formal requirements (admissibility and eligibility) and then
evaluated (for each topic separately) by an evaluation committee composed of independent
external experts for operational capacity and award criteria (see Annexes C and D above) and
then ranked according to their quality score.
For lump sum grants proposals, comments on the detailed lump sum budget table will be
provided in the Evaluation Summary Report only for proposals invited to grant agreement
preparation (or placed in the reserve list) and ones rejected (in part) due to significant
overestimation or underestimation of costs.
Exceptionally, where indicated in the specific call/topic conditions, the evaluation committee
may be composed partially or, in the case of ‘Coordination and support actions’, partially or
fully of representatives of EU institutions.
For proposals with the same score within a single budget envelope (with the exception of the
first stage of two-stage submissions) a method to establish the priority order will be
determined, taking into consideration the objectives of the specific topic. In the absence of
special arrangements in the specific call/topic conditions, the following method will apply:
For each group of proposals with the same score, starting with the group achieving the highest
score and continuing in descending order:
1) Proposals that address aspects of the call that have not otherwise been covered by
more highly ranked proposals will be considered to have the highest priority.
2) The proposals identified under 1), if any, will themselves be prioritised according to
the scores they have been awarded for ‘Excellence’. When these scores are equal,
priority will be based on scores for ‘Impact’. In the case of ‘Innovation actions’,
priority will be given to the score for ‘Impact’, followed by that for ‘Excellence’.
3) If necessary, the gender balance among the researchers named in the researchers table
in the proposal, will be used as a factor for prioritisation.
4) If necessary, any further prioritisation will be based on geographical diversity, defined
as the number of Member States or Associated Countries represented in the proposal,
Page 28 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
not otherwise receiving funds from projects higher up the ranking list (and if equal in
number, then by budget).
5) If a distinction still cannot be made, the panel may decide to further prioritise by
considering other factors related to the objectives of the call, or to Horizon Europe in
general. These may include, for example, enhancing the quality of the project portfolio
through synergies between projects or, where relevant and feasible, involving SMEs.
These factors will be documented in the panel report.
6) The method described in 1), 2), 3) and 4) will then be applied to the remaining equally
ranked proposals in the group.
At the end of the evaluation, all applicants will be informed of the result in an evaluation
result letter. Successful proposals will be invited to the next stage, ‘grant preparation’; the
other proposals will be put on the reserve list or rejected.
No commitment to provide funding — Invitation to the grant preparation stage does NOT
constitute a formal commitment to funding. Various legal checks are still needed before the
grant can be awarded, such as legal entity validation, financial capacity verification, exclusion
check, etc.
If indicated in the specific call/topic conditions, proposals which were judged to deserve
funding but did not succeed because of budget limits will receive a Seal of Excellence37. With
prior authorisation from the applicant, the granting authority may share information
concerning the proposal and the evaluation with interested financing authorities, subject to the
conclusion of confidentiality agreements.
Budget flexibility — The budgets set out in the calls and topics are indicative. Unless
otherwise stated, final budgets may change following evaluation. The final figures may
change by up to 20% compared to the total budget indicated in each individual part of the
work programme. Changes within these limits will not be considered substantial within the
meaning of Article 110(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 2018/1046.
Joint calls for proposals — In cases of applications for joint calls with third countries
(including scientific and technological organisations or agencies from third countries),
international organisations or non-profit legal entities, the joint selection and evaluation
procedures will be indicated in the specific call/topic conditions.
Blind evaluation pilot – If indicated in the specific call/topic conditions, first-stage
proposals of two-stage submissions will be evaluated blindly38 and applicants must not
disclose their identity in Part B of their proposal (see Annex A above).
Evaluation review procedure
37 https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/seal-excellence_en.
38 See Horizon Europe Programme Guide for further details.
Page 29 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
If the consortium believes that the evaluation procedure was flawed, the coordinator can
submit a complaint (following the deadlines and procedures also set out in the evaluation
result letter).
Only the procedural aspects of an evaluation may be the subject of a request for an evaluation
review. The evaluation of the merits of a proposal will not be the subject of an evaluation
review.
A request for an evaluation review must relate to a specific proposal and must be submitted
within 30 days after the beneficiary accesses the evaluation results. The deadlines will be
counted from the date of opening/access. The maximum size limit of the request is 7 000
characters. Notifications of evaluation results which have not been opened in the Funding &
Tenders Portal within 10 days after sending are considered to have been accessed (see also
Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions).
An evaluation review committee will provide an opinion on the procedural aspects of the
evaluation. The evaluation review committee may recommend a re-evaluation of the proposal,
to be carried out primarily by evaluators who were not involved in the previous evaluation, or
a confirmation of the initial evaluation.
Indicative timetable for evaluation and for signature of the grant agreement
Unless otherwise stated in the specific call/topic conditions, the timing for evaluation and
grant preparation is as follows:
– information on the outcome of the evaluation: around 5 months from the deadline for
submission;
– indicative date for the signing of grant agreements: around 8 months from the deadline
for submission.
For two-stage calls, the timing is different (for the evaluation result: around 3 months from
the deadline for submission for the first stage, and around 5 months from the deadline for
submission for the second stage, for signature of the grant agreement around 8 months from in
the second stage deadline for submission).
Page 30 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
G — Legal and financial set-up of the grant agreements
During the grant preparation stage, the consortium will be asked to prepare the grant
agreement, together with the EU project officer.
This grant agreement will set out the framework for the grant and its terms and conditions,
particularly concerning deliverables, reporting and payments. The applicable model with the
complete text of the provisions is available on the topic page, together with the other call
documentation.
Starting date & project duration
The project starting date and duration will be fixed in the grant agreement (see Data Sheet,
point 1). Normally, the starting date will be after the grant has been signed. A starting date
before the date the grant is signed (retroactive) can be granted exceptionally for duly justified
reasons, if agreed with the granting authority39.
The project duration is provided in months (extensions will be possible only exceptionally, for
duly justified reasons and if the granting authority agrees).
Milestones and deliverables
The milestones and deliverables for each project will be managed through the grant
management system in the Portal and are reflected in Annex 1 of the grant agreement.
The standard deliverables will be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
Form of grant, funding rate and maximum grant amount
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be
fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 3 and Article 5).
The project budget is provided in EUR. The amount of the grant awarded may be lower than
the amount requested.
For actual cost grants, the grant will be a budget-based, mixed actual cost grant. This means
that it will reimburse ONLY certain types of costs (eligible costs) and ONLY those costs
actually incurred for the project (NOT the budgeted costs).
The costs will be reimbursed at the funding rate fixed in the specific call/topic conditions and
in the grant agreement.
Such grants may NOT produce a profit. If there is a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU grant
over costs), it will be deducted from the final grant amount.
Moreover, the final grant amount may be reduced in case of non-compliance (e.g. improper
implementation, breach of obligations, etc.).
39 See Article 193 EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046.
Page 31 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
The maximum Horizon Europe funding rates are as follows:
– Research and innovation action: 100%
– Innovation action: 70% (except for non-profit legal entities, where a rate of up to
100% applies)
– Coordination and support action: 100%
– Programme co-fund action: between 30% and 70%
– Innovation and market deployment: 70% (except for non-profit legal entities, where a
rate of up to 100% applies)
– Training and mobility action: 100%
– Pre-commercial procurement action: 100%
– Public procurement of innovative solutions action: 50%
Other funding rates may be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
For lump sum and unit grants, the funding rate is already applied as part of the
methodology for fixing the amounts and is therefore not shown in the grant agreement.
Budget categories and cost eligibility rules
The budget categories and cost eligibility rules are fixed in the grant agreement (see Data
Sheet, point 3 and Article 6).
Budget categories:
– actual costs (i.e. costs which are real and not estimated or budgeted) for:
– personnel costs (unless declared as a unit cost; see below);
– subcontracting costs;
– purchase costs (unless declared as a unit cost; see below); and
– costs of providing financial support to third parties (if provided for in the
specific call conditions);
– units (i.e. an amount per unit) for:
– personnel costs of SME owners/natural persons not receiving a salary;
– personnel costs calculated by the beneficiaries according to their usual cost
accounting practices (average personnel costs);
– costs of internally invoiced goods and services calculated by the beneficiaries
according to their usual cost accounting practices; and
Page 32 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
– specific unit costs (if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions; see also
Annex 2a of the grant agreement);
– flat-rate (i.e. costs calculated by applying a percentage fixed in advance to other types
of eligible costs) for:
– indirect costs (25% flat-rate of the total eligible direct costs, excluding eligible
direct costs for subcontracting, financial support to third parties and any unit
costs or lump sums which include indirect costs);
– lump sum (i.e. a global amount deemed to cover all costs of the action or a specific
category of costs, if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions).
Within a grant, different forms of costs can be used.
Costs can also be declared under several EU Synergy grants, if the cumulative funding under
the grants does not exceed 100% of the eligible costs and the contributions declared to them.
Reporting & payment arrangements
The reporting and payment arrangements are fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 4
and articles 21 and 22).
After the grant has been signed, the consortium will normally receive a float to start working
on the project (normally, pre-financing of 160% of the average EU funding per reporting
period (i.e. maximum grant amount/number of periods); exceptionally, less or no pre-
financing). For actions with only one reporting period, it will be less, since 100% would mean
the totality of the grant amount.
Programme co-fund actions may receive additional pre-financing payments.
Payments will be automatically lowered if one of the consortium members has outstanding
debts towards the EU (granting authority or other EU bodies). Such debts will be offset by the
granting authority, in line with the conditions set out in the grant agreement (see Article 22).
At the moment of the prefinancing payment, an amount ranging from 5% to 8% of the
maximum grant amount will be deducted from the prefinancing payment and transferred to
the mutual insurance mechanism. This mechanism covers the risks associated with non-
recovery of sums due from the beneficiaries.
There will be one or several interim payments linked to a periodic report, depending on the
duration of the project.
At the end of the project, the consortium will be invited to submit a report on the basis of
which the final grant amount will be calculated. If the total of earlier payments is higher than
the final grant amount, the beneficiaries concerned (or the coordinator) will be asked to pay
back the difference (recovery).
Certificates
Page 33 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Depending on the size of the grant amount and on the type of beneficiaries, beneficiaries may
be required to submit a certificate on the financial statements. The thresholds for this
certificate are fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 4 and Article 24).
Liability regime for recoveries
The liability regime for recoveries is that of individual financial responsibility. Each
beneficiary is liable only for their own debt (and those of its affiliated entities, if any) (Data
Sheet point 4.4 and Article 22).
Provisions concerning project implementation
– Proper implementation of the action (Article 11).
– Conflict of interest (Article 12).
– Confidentiality and security (EU classified information) (Article 13 and Annex 5).
– Ethics (research integrity) and values (gender mainstreaming) (Article 14 and Annex
5).
– Data protection (Article 15).
– Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), background and results, access rights and rights of
use (Article 16 and Annex 5). In addition to the standard provisions, the following
specific provisions in the model grant agreement will apply to all grants awarded
under this work programme:
Additional exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency: If
requested by the granting authority, beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive
licences to their results – for a limited period of time specified in the request
and on fair and reasonable conditions – to legal entities that need the results to
address the public emergency. These legal entities must commit to rapidly and
broadly exploiting the resulting products and services on fair and reasonable
conditions. This provision will apply up to 4 years after the end of the action.
Additional information obligation relating to standards: Unless stated
otherwise in the specific call conditions, beneficiaries must, up to 4 years after
the end of the action, inform the granting authority if the results could
reasonably be expected to contribute to European or international standards.
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing — Horizon
Europe actions: The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the
action, object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results,
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5.
– Communication, dissemination, open science and visibility (Article 17 and Annex 5).
In addition to the standard provisions, the following specific provisions in the model
grant agreement will apply to all grants awarded under this work programme:
Page 34 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Open science - additional practices, validation of scientific publications:
Beneficiaries must provide (digital or physical) access to data or other results
needed to validate the conclusions of scientific publications, to the extent that
their legitimate interests or constraints are safeguarded (and unless they
already provided the (open) access at publication).
Open science - additional practices, public emergency: In case of a public
emergency, if requested by the granting authority, beneficiaries must
immediately deposit any research output in a repository and provide open
access to it under a CC BY licence, a public domain dedication (CC 0) or
equivalent.
As an exception, if providing open access would be against the beneficiaries’
legitimate interests, the beneficiaries must grant non-exclusive licences, on fair
and reasonable conditions, to legal entities that need the research output to
address the public emergency. These legal entities must commit to rapidly and
broadly exploiting the resulting products and services on fair and reasonable
conditions. This exception is limited to 4 years after the end of the action.
– Specific rules for carrying out the action (Article 18 and Annex 5).
Other provisions may be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
Non-compliance and breach of contract
The grant agreement (Chapter 5) provides for the measures that may be taken in case of
breach of contract (and other violations of law).
For more information, see the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.

General Annexes
IMPORTANT
• Do not wait until the end — Complete the application sufficiently in advance of the deadline to avoid any
last minute technical problems. Problems due to last-minute submissions (e.g. congestion, etc.) will be
entirely at applicants’ own risk. Call deadlines can NOT be extended at the request of applicants.
• Consult the topic page on the Portal regularly. The granting authority will use it to publish updates and
additional information on the call (call updates).
• Funding & Tenders Portal electronic exchange system — By submitting the application, all applicants
accept to use the electronic exchange system in accordance with the Portal Terms & Conditions.
• Registration — Before submitting the application, all beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated partners
must be registered in the Participant Register. The participant identification code (PIC) (one per participant)
is mandatory for the application form. For validation, beneficiaries and affiliated entities will be requested to
upload the necessary documents showing their legal status and origin during the grant preparation stage.
Associated partners do not need validation.
• Consortium roles — When setting up the consortium, applicants should think of organisations that can help
them reach objectives and solve problems.
The roles should be attributed according to the degree of participation of each participant in the project. Main
participants should participate as beneficiaries or affiliated entities; other entities may participate as
associated partners, subcontractors, or third parties giving in-kind contributions, provided that the related
conditions are fulfilled. Associated partners and third parties giving in-kind contributions should bear their
own costs (they will not become formal recipients of EU funding). Subcontracting should normally constitute
a limited part and must be performed by third parties (not by one of the beneficiaries/affiliated entities, see
section G).
• Coordinator — In multi-beneficiary grants, the beneficiaries participate as a consortium (group of
beneficiaries). They will have to choose a coordinator among them, who will manage and coordinate the
project and will represent the consortium towards the granting authority. In mono-beneficiary grants, the
single beneficiary will automatically be the coordinator.
• Affiliated entities — Applicants may participate with affiliated entities. Affiliated entities will get a part of
the EU funding and must therefore comply with all the call conditions (just like beneficiaries). But they do
not sign the grant agreement and do not count towards the minimum eligibility criteria for consortium
composition (if any).
• Associated partners — Applicants may participate with associated partners. They participate without
funding and without signing the grant agreement and therefore do not need to be validated.
• Consortium agreement — For practical and legal reasons, participants must conclude a written consortium
agreement to ensure the smooth and successful implementation of the action and to deal with exceptional or
unforeseen circumstances, unless otherwise provided for in the specific call conditions. The consortium
agreement also gives the possibility to redistribute the EU funding according to internal consortium
principles and arrangements (for instance, one beneficiary can reattribute their grant share to another
beneficiary). The consortium agreement thus allows the grant to be customised to the needs of the consortium
and can also help to protect the members in case of disputes. Consortium agreements are not required for
mono-beneficiary projects.
• Completed/ongoing projects — Applications for projects that have already been completed will be rejected.
Applications for projects that have already started will be assessed on a case-by-case basis (in such cases, no
costs can normally be reimbursed for activities that took place before the application was submitted).
Page 36 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
• No-profit rule — Grants may NOT give a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU grant over costs). This will
be checked by the granting authority at the end of the project.
• No double funding — There is strict prohibition of double funding from the EU budget. Any given action
may receive only ONE grant from the EU budget (except for EU Synergy grants) and same costs may
under NO circumstances be declared to two different EU actions.
• Combination with EU operating grants — Combination with EU operating grants is possible, if the
project remains outside the operating grant work programme and the beneficiary makes sure that cost items
are clearly separated in its accounting and NOT declared twice (see AGA — Annotated Model Grant
Agreement, Article 6.2.E).
• Multiple applications — Applicants may submit more than one application for different projects under the
same call (and be awarded funding for them).
Organisations may participate in several applications.
BUT: if there are several applications for the same/very similar project, only one application will be
accepted and evaluated.
• Language — Applicants can submit their application in any official EU language. However, for reasons of
efficiency, it is strongly advised to use English. If applicants need the call documentation in another
official EU language, they must submit a request within 10 days after publication of the call (for the
contact information, see topic page).
• Rejection — By submitting the application, all applicants accept the general call conditions set out in the
General Annexes and the specific call conditions set out in the topics. Applications that do not comply with
all the call conditions will be rejected. This applies also to applicants: all applicants need to fulfil the
criteria; if any one of them does not, they must be replaced or the entire application will be rejected.
• Cancellation — There may be circumstances which may require the cancellation of the call. In this case,
applicants will be informed via a call update. Cancellations are without entitlement to compensation.
• Transparency — In accordance with Article 38 of the EU Financial Regulation 2018/1046, information
about EU grants awarded is published each year on the Europa website.
This includes:
• beneficiaries’ names;
• beneficiaries’ addresses;
• the purpose for which the grant was awarded;
• the maximum amount awarded.
Publication can exceptionally be waived (following a reasoned and duly substantiated request), if there is a
risk that disclosure could jeopardise applicants’ rights and freedoms under the EU Charter of Fundamental
Rights or harm its commercial interests.
• Data protection — The submission of an application under this call involves the collection, use and
processing of personal data. This data will be processed in accordance with Regulation 2018/1725. It will
be processed solely for the purpose of evaluating the application (and subsequent management of the grant
and, if needed, programme monitoring, evaluation and communication). Details are explained in the
Funding & Tenders Portal privacy statement.

General Annexes
SPECIFIC CONDITIONS FOR ACTIONS WITH PCP/PPI
H — Specific conditions for actions implementing pre-commercial procurement or
procurement of innovative solutions
This Annex applies to all types of actions implementing pre-commercial procurement (PCP)
and procurement of innovative solutions (PPI). It applies to both PCP/PPI actions and other
types of actions which prepare and/or execute a PCP or PPI, for instance through
subcontracting activities.
Requirements for all types of actions supporting PCP or PPI
The PCP/PPI must be prepared and executed by one of the following:
- by one or more public procurer(s), plus possibly one or more private and/or NGO
procurer(s) that provide similar services of public interest, that is (are) responsible for
the acquisition and/or regulatory strategy of the relevant innovative solutions and aim
to obtain ambitious quality and efficiency improvements in the area of the PCP/PPI; or
- by entities with a mandate from one or more of these procurers to act on their behalf in
the procurement (e.g. central purchasing bodies).
Other entities (e.g. end-users) that do not have a conflict of interest with the PCP/PPI, and
whose participation in the action is well justified, may participate in ‘additional activities’ to
prepare, manage and follow-up the PCP/PPI and embed it into a wider set of demand-side
activities. This includes disseminating results, removing obstacles to introducing the solutions
onto the market (e.g. contributing to standardisation, regulation and certification), awareness
raising, experience sharing/training, and preparing further cooperation among stakeholders
and procurers for future PCP or PPI.
For PCP executed by a group of procurers, the buyers’ group must jointly prepare and
implement the pre-commercial procurement so that there is one joint call for tender, one joint
evaluation of offers, and a lead procurer40 awarding the research and development (R&D)
service contracts in the name and on behalf of the buyers’ group. The PCP must address one
concrete procurement need identified as a common challenge41, which requires new R&D and
is described in the common specifications of the joint PCP call for tender. Each procurer in
the buyers’ group must contribute financially to the total budget necessary to jointly finance
the PCP, enabling the procurers to share the costs of procuring R&D services from a number
of providers and comparing the merits of the alternative solutions pursued by these competing
providers to address the common challenge.
40 The ‘lead procurer’ is a public procurer and is the beneficiary appointed by the buyers’ group to coordinate
and lead the procurement activities. They can be either one of the procurers in the buyers’ group or another
beneficiary in the action who is established or designated by the procurers in the buyers’ group to act as lead
procurer.
41 Addressing the common challenge in different countries may require, beyond the common core functionality,
the development and testing of additional local functionality or adaption of solutions by each procurer due to
differences in the local context. A PCP that addresses a challenge consisting of several facets (sub-challenges or
building blocks) is considered one joint PCP, as long as all procurers in the buyers’ group share the need for -
and are willing to co-finance - all the facets of the common challenge.
Page 38 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
For PPI executed by a group of procurers, the lead procurer must coordinate the preparation
and implementation of one joint or several coordinated public procurements of innovative
solutions, based on common specifications defined jointly by the buyers’ group. Each PPI
must focus on one concrete need identified as a common challenge that requires the
deployment of innovative solutions42.
Projects that aim to implement a PCP/PPI must contain a preparation and execution stage.
Preparation stage
The expected outcomes for the preparation stage, to be included as deliverables/milestones,
are:
- a prior information notice for the open market consultation: 5 days before submission
for publication to the OJEU, i.e. a minimum of 50 days before the start of the first
meeting;
- a report on the result of the open market consultation, prior market analysis and its
impact on the tender documents; in addition, for PPI, feedback from activities to verify
market readiness before deployment (e.g. conformance testing, certification, quality
labelling);
- completed tender documents based on the Horizon Europe PCP/PPI model contract
documents, including the contract notice: 30 days before its submission to the OJEU;
- for PCP/PPI executed by a group of procurers: the signed joint procurement agreement
confirming the final means of cooperation, including the financial commitment of the
buyers’ group for the PCP/PPI, and final confirmation of the lead procurer.
Execution stage
The expected outcome of the execution stage is the implementation of the procurement
procedure and of the PCP/PPI contracts. For PCP, this includes validating and comparing the
performance of the competing PCP solutions to verify if they can be converted into permanent
service. For PPI, this includes deploying the innovative solutions and evaluating the results in
real-life operating conditions, with a duration that allows for appropriate evaluation of the
potential impact of these solutions if converted into permanent service.
Deliverables/milestones to be included in the description of work for the execution stage are:
– a copy of the contract award notice published in TED: 48 days after the award of
contracts;
– at the end of the tender evaluation (for PCP, also after the evaluations of each phase):
– information on the total number of bids received, particularly the data on the
winning tenderer(s) and abstracts of the winning tenders for publication and
evaluation purposes;
42 Addressing the common challenge in different countries may require deployment and, where applicable,
conformance testing, of local functionality or adaption of solutions for each procurer due to differences in the
local context.
Page 39 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
– final ranking list of the selected projects, final scores and qualitative assessment
per criterion for each bid received, along with minutes of the evaluation meeting;
– for PCP: assessing the results achieved by each tenderer in the previous phase;
– at the end of the action, give a demonstration to the granting authority:
– for PCP: of the tested solutions resulting from the PCP;
– for PPI: of the deployed innovative solution(s).
Where the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) does not apply, participation in
tendering procedures must be open on equal terms to bidders from EU Member States and all
countries with which the EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement under the
conditions laid down in that agreement, including all Horizon Europe Associated Countries.
Where the WTO GPA applies, tendering procedures must also be open to bidders from states
that have ratified this agreement, under the conditions laid down therein.
If the specific call conditions restrict participation or control for security reasons, participation
in the PCP/PPI procedure must also be limited to bidders meeting this restriction. If the
specific conditions for the topic impose a place of performance obligation, the place of
performance of the contract must comply with this obligation.
Specific requirements for pre-commercial procurement (PCP)
The following requirements apply to ensure that the provisions for PCP in the Horizon Europe
rules for participation, the conditions for the R&D services exemption of the EU Directives on
public procurement43, the EU Treaty principles44 and the competition rules45 are fully
respected.
Definitions
PCP must comply with the Horizon Europe definition: ‘Pre-commercial procurement’ means
procurement of R&D services involving risk-benefit sharing under market conditions and
competitive development in phases, where there is a clear separation between the procurement
of the R&D services procured from the deployment of commercial volumes of end-products46.
‘Risk-benefit sharing under market conditions’ refers to the PCP approach in which procurers
share with suppliers at market price the risks and benefits related to the intellectual property
rights (IPR) resulting from the R&D.
43 See Article 14 of Directive 2014/24/EU, Article 32 of Directive 2014/25/EU and Article 13(f)(j) of Directive
2009/81/EC.
44 In particular, the fundamental Treaty principles on the free movement of goods and workers, the freedom to
provide services, the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital, as well as the principles
deriving therefrom, such as the principles of non-discrimination, transparency and equal treatment.
45 See, in particular, Article 2.3 of the 2014 R&D&I State aid framework.
46 See the Horizon Europe Regulation and the PCP Communication COM/2007/799 and associated
SEC(1668)2007. Note that PCPs can include the purchase of the first end-products that were developed, installed
and tested during the PCP, but not the purchase of larger commercial volumes of end-products requiring quantity
production beyond delivering the first products for the PCP.
Page 40 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
‘Competitive development in phases’ refers to buying the R&D from several competing R&D
providers in parallel and to comparing and identifying the best-value-for-money solutions on
the market to address the PCP challenge. To reduce the investment risk for the procurer,
reward the most competitive solutions and facilitate the participation of smaller innovative
companies, the R&D is also split into phases (solution design, prototyping, original
development and validation/testing of the first products), with the number of competing R&D
providers being reduced after each phase.
‘Separation from the deployment of commercial volumes of end-products’ refers to the
complementarity of PCP, which focuses on the R&D phase before wide commercialisation,
and PPI, which does not focus on R&D but on wide commercialisation/diffusion of solutions.
Procurers can, but are not obliged, to procure R&D results from a PCP.
Preparation and publication of the open market consultation and call for tender
To prepare the call for tender, an open market consultation47 with potential tenderers and end-
users must be held to broach the views of the market on the intended scope of the R&D. The
results of this open market consultation must be taken into account to fine-tune the tender
specifications, so that the gap between state-of-the-art industry development and the
procurement needs justifies the procuring of R&D48 services.
The PCP contract notice must be published EU-wide49 in at least English. Offers must be
accepted and communication with stakeholders must be enabled at all stages in at least
English. All offers must be evaluated according to the same objective criteria, regardless of
the geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of the tenderers.
The prior information notice for the open market consultation and the contract notice must be
advertised widely, using in particular Horizon Europe internet sites and national contact
points. The Commission must be informed at least 5 days before the expected date of
publication of the prior information notice for the open market consultation and 30 days
before the expected date of publication of the PCP contract notice. The PCP call for tenders
must remain open for at least 60 days.
Tender documentation, procurement and implementation of the contract
47 The open market consultation should be organised in a way not to preclude or distort competition. In respect
of the Treaty principles, the open market consultation must be announced well in advance and widely - via a
prior information notice that is published at least 45 days before the first open market consultation meeting in the
Official Journal of the EU - and enable potential tenderers regardless of their geographic location to participate at
least in English. All information given in answers to questions from participants in the dialogue should be
documented and published.
48 In line with WTO GPA 2014 Article XIII(1)(f), R&D can cover activities such as solution exploration and
design, prototyping, up to the original development of a limited volume of first products or services in the form
of a test series. Original development of a first product or service may include limited production or supply to
incorporate the results of field testing and demonstrate that the product or service is suitable for production or
supply in quantity to acceptable quality standards. R&D does not include quantity production or supply to
establish commercial viability or to recover R&D costs, nor commercial development activities such as
incremental adaptations or routine or periodic changes to existing products, services, production lines, processes

General Annexes
The PCP contract that will be concluded with each selected tenderer must take the form of
one single framework agreement covering all PCP phases, without contract renegotiations
after the award. This framework agreement must contain information on the procedures for
implementing the different phases (through specific contracts), including the format of the
intermediate evaluations (including evaluation criteria and weightings) for each phase.
For PCP executed by a group of procurers, the R&D service contracts are awarded by the lead
procurer and all selected tenderers can be paid by the lead procurer, or pro rata by each
procurer in the buyers’ group according to their share in the total PCP budget.
The PCP contract notice must contain information on the intended number of R&D providers
that will be selected (minimum of three providers) to start the PCP, the number of PCP phases
and the expected duration and budget for each PCP phase. The PCP must cover the full PCP
life cycle of solution design, prototyping, and original development, including installation and
testing of a limited volume of test series products/services in the procurer’s/end-user’s
premises. Each of the three PCP phases can be split up into further phases if appropriate.
The following simplified and/or accelerated PCP procedures may be used: for PCP that
require fast deployment50, one specific contract may cover both the second and third PCP
phase; if fewer than two tenderers are capable of performing the R&D services in the EU
Member States or Associated Countries (for security contracts, this may be restricted to the
Member States), the phase 1 contracts may be awarded to a minimum of two tenderers.
Procurers must avoid the use of selection criteria based on disproportionate qualification and
financial guarantee requirements (e.g. with regard to prior customer references and minimum
turnover). Functional/performance-based specifications must be used to formulate the object
of the PCP call for tender as a problem to be solved, without prescribing a specific approach
to be followed. Evaluation of the tenders must be based on best-value-for-money criteria, not
just lowest price.
The PCP process must be organised to avoid any conflicts of interest, including in the use of
external experts. Providers cannot be beneficiaries in an action during which the PCP is
planned or undertaken.
The PCP process must require selected providers to locate the majority of the R&D activities,
including the principal researcher(s) working for the PCP contract in particular, in the
Member States or Associated Countries51.
The PCP procurers must not reserve the R&D results exclusively for their own use. The
providers generating results must own the attached IPR, and the procurers must enjoy at least
royalty-free access rights to use the R&D results for their own use. The procurers must also
enjoy the right to grant (or to require the granting of) non-exclusive licences to third parties,
to exploit the results under fair and reasonable market conditions, without any right to
50 Especially where a budgetary commitment for deployment is already available at the start of the PCP (fast-
track PCP).
51 For duly justified reasons of public security, this may be limited to the EU Member States.

General Annexes
sublicense. A call-back provision must ensure that, in case the providers fail to commercially
exploit the results within a given period after the PCP, or use the results to the detriment of
the public interest, including security interests, the procurers can require transfer of the
ownership of the results.
The procurers must inform tenderers of the right to publish public summaries of the results of
the PCP project, including information about key R&D results attained and lessons learnt (e.g.
on the feasibility of the solution approaches to meet the requirements and lessons learnt for
potential future deployment of solutions). Details that would be contrary to the public interest,
would harm legitimate business interests (e.g. regarding IPR-protected specificities of their
individual approaches to solutions) or could distort fair competition may not be disclosed.
To enable the procurers to establish the correct (best value for money) market price for the
R&D service, in which case the presence of State aid can in principle be excluded, the PCP
call for tender must be carried out in a competitive and transparent way in line with Treaty
principles. In addition, the distribution of rights and obligations between procurers and
providers (including the allocation of IPR) must be published in the PCP call for tender
documents, to obtain a price according to market conditions (and rule out State aid). PCP
contracts with providers must contain financial compensation according to market
conditions52, compared to the exclusive development price, for assigning IPR to the providers.
Specific requirements for public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI)
Definition
PPI must comply with the relevant Horizon Europe definitions.
‘Public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI)’ means procurement where contracting
authorities act as a launch customer for innovative goods or services which are not yet
available on a large-scale commercial basis, and may include conformity testing.
‘Launch customers’, also called early adopters, refer to the first 20% of customers on the
EU’s internal market that buy innovative solutions. The solutions have to be new to the
procurers in the project, the procurers’ market segment or new to the EU’s internal market,
and relevant to procurers in other Member States and/or Associated Countries.
‘Innovative solutions’ are new or significantly improved products, services or processes that
have already been (partially) demonstrated on a small scale, and may be nearly or already
available in small quantities on the market, but which have not been widely adopted yet.
Typically, owing to the residual risk of market uncertainty, they have not been produced at a
large enough scale to meet mass market price/quality requirements. This also includes
existing solutions that are to be utilised in a new and innovative way; PPI does not include the
procurement of R&D.
52 The market price should reflect the benefits allocated to the R&D provider (e.g. commercialisation
opportunities opened up by the IPR) and the risks assumed by the R&D provider (e.g. the cost of maintaining the
IPR and commercialising the products).
Page 43 of 45Horizon Europe - Work programme 2023-2025
General Annexes
Preparation and publication of the open market consultation and call for tender
Unless the PPI is undertaken as a follow-up to an FP7, Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe
PCP53, or unless the situation is a low-value PPI below national procurement thresholds, the
following obligations apply:
– To prepare the call for tenders, an open market consultation with potential tenderers
and end-users must be held to inform the market well in advance of the upcoming PPI
and broach the views of the market on the PPI’s intended scope. Information retrieved
from this consultation about the gap between perceived procurement needs and on-
going industry developments must be taken into account in the PPI tender
specifications, so that the PPI duly focuses on ‘early adoption’ of ‘innovative’
solutions.
– The market must be informed well in advance54 of the target date for publishing the
PPI call for tenders. Market readiness prior to deployment can be verified through the
organisation of e.g. conformity testing, certification or quality labelling of solutions.
– The PPI contract notices must be published EU-wide in at least English, offers must be
accepted and communication with stakeholders must be enabled at all stages in at least
English. All offers must be evaluated according to the same objective criteria,
regardless of the geographical location, size of organisation or governance structure of
the tenderers.
– The prior information notices for the open market consultation, early announcements
of the expected publication date of the PPI call for tender, and the PPI contract notice
must be promoted and advertised widely, using Horizon Europe internet sites and
national contact points in particular. The Commission must be informed at least 5 days
before the expected date of publication of the PIN for the open market consultation
and 30 days before the expected date of publication of the PPI contract notice. The PPI
call for tenders must remain open for at least 60 days.
Tender documentation, procurement and implementation of the contract
Procurement procedures covered by the EU public procurement directives that do not involve
procurement of R&D can be used. Restricted procedures with shortened timeframes for the
submission of offers for reasons of urgency must not be used. Framework
contracts/agreements with lots can be used.
For PPI implemented by a group of procurers, the specific contracts for procuring specific
quantities of goods/services for each procurer can be awarded and the selected tenderers can
53 In the case of a PPI following a PCP that was implemented according to the conditions described in Annex I,
the negotiated procedure without publication foreseen in the EU public procurement directives can then be used
(Article 32(3)(a) of Directive 2014/24/EU, Article 50(b) of Directive 2014/25/EU and Article 13(j) of Directive
2009/81/EC). At least three offers must be requested, including from the R&D providers that successfully
completed the preceding PCP.

General Annexes
either all be paid by the lead procurer, or by each procurer in the buyers’ group individually,
for their quantity of goods/services procured.
Procurers must avoid the use of selection criteria based on disproportionate qualification and
financial guarantee requirements (e.g. with regard to prior customer references and minimum
turnover). Functional/performance-based specifications must be used to formulate the object
of the PPI call for tenders as a problem to be solved, without prescribing a specific approach
to be followed. Evaluation of the tenders must be based on best-value-for-money criteria, not
just lowest price.
Procurers must organise their procurement to avoid any conflicts of interest, including in the
use of external experts. Potential providers cannot be beneficiaries in an action during which
the PPI is planned or undertaken.
To encourage fair and wide exploitation of results, ownership of IPR rights should be
assigned to the party generating the IPR, except in duly justified cases (e.g. when that party is
not able to exploit them).
The PPI call for tender must be carried out in a competitive and transparent way in line with
Treaty principles. The distribution of rights and obligations between procurers and providers
(including the allocation of IPR) must be published in the PPI call for tender documents, to
obtain a price according to market conditions (and rule out State aid).

Introduction
The Union and the world are gradually learning how to live with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pandemic laid bare the vulnerabilities of our societies, economies and health care systems
and made evident the need for a strong European crisis preparedness and response in which
Europe is now decidedly investing. The European Health Emergency Preparedness and
Response Authority (HERA) created in September 2021 is key to this endeavour. The present
work programme will support HERA and Europe’s pandemic preparedness by investing in
research into better management of epidemics, adaptable clinical networks for drugs and
vaccines and better comprehension of the emergence of cross-border health threats. Particular
attention is paid to translational research, to facilitating the development and implementation
of new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat infectious diseases, including the growing
problem of antimicrobial drug resistance. Focus is not only on immediate health threats, but
also on the wider societal impacts of health crises e.g. on peoples’ mental health and
wellbeing and on health care system resilience. Research conducted during the pandemic and
following its sequels is pivotal to inform preparedness for potential similar events in the
future. The pandemic has also demonstrated the downside of globalisation in which the
dependence on global value chains can quickly result in shortages of critical supplies, such as
essential medicines or other health technologies.
To help repair the economic and social damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the
European Commission, the European Parliament and EU Member States leaders agreed on a
Recovery Plan for Europe that will lead the way out of the crisis and lay the foundations for a
modern and more sustainable Union. The Health cluster will continue to benefit from
financial resources of this Multiannual Financial Framework and from NextGenerationEU
(NGEU), the Union’s financing instrument to boost the recovery. It requires research and
innovation supporting the recovery of people and communities from COVID-19 but also for
making society more resilient and national health systems better prepared to any future public
health emergency.
The Recovery Plan aims the Union to building back better, including through support for the
twin digital and green transitions by unlocking the full potential of data-enabled research and
innovation for digitised health systems and a competitive and secure data-economy, including
on the basis of European Electronic Health Records as well as the establishment of the
European Health Data Space. The digital transformation of health and care will help increase
the capacity of health care systems to deliver more personalised and effective health and care
with less resource wasting. It will contribute, but is not sufficient, to making the Union the
first climate-neutral continent by 2050, with zero pollution and zero waste. Additional efforts
are needed to also make the delivery of health care, the design of health technologies and their
manufacturing more sustainable by reducing energy consumption, waste, pollution and the
release of harmful substances, including pharmaceuticals, into the environment.
Even though research and innovation have the power to uncovering the knowledge and
developing the technologies to serve societal well-being, economic prosperity and
Part 4 - Page 7 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
environmental sustainability, it only can succeed through cooperation of the best research
teams with the prospective users of such knowledge and technologies. It is thus of outmost
importance to involve those users - like patients and healthy citizens, health care professionals
providers and payers, public health authorities and regulators, researchers or innovators from
academia and industry - early in the knowledge generation or technology development
process, including through patient/citizen engagement, community involvement or other
forms of social innovation approaches, such that research and innovation activities are
adjusted to the users’ particular expectations, needs, constraints and potential. Any
cooperation would benefit from adequate intellectual property management strategies.
Beyond cooperating along the value chain of knowledge and know-how production and
valorisation or within the knowledge triangle (research-education-innovation), it is in the
EU’s strategic interest to also reach out and cooperate with other countries outside the EU and
on other continents. This applies in particular for multi-lateral cooperation on (global) health
issues with countries associated to Horizon Europe but also with other partner countries and
regions in the world. In line with the EU’s Global Approach to Research and Innovation1,
participation in Cluster 1 of Horizon Europe is open to third countries. In support of the
Global Gateway Strategy2, projects involving international partners should lead to increased
scientific knowledge and transfer of technology among partner countries allowing to address
global health challenges across the world, thus creating sustainable growth and jobs.
Cooperation should take place in a value-based way, creating linkages, not dependencies”.
The pandemic has demonstrated the importance of effective coordination among EU Member
States in the area of health. The European Commission is building a strong European Health
Union, in which all EU Member States work together to improve prevention, diagnosis,
treatment and aftercare for any disease, including cancer. Research and innovation actions
under the Health Cluster will deliver relevant complementary inputs to “Europe’s Beating
Cancer Plan”3, contributing to actions covering the entire cancer care pathway, including
prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of
life of cancer patients and survivors.
For topics in this cluster, consortia could consider their voluntary contribution in terms of
data, indicators and knowledge to relevant Joint Research Centre (JRC) platforms for
capitalising the knowledge developed in their projects and become more policy relevant4 5 6 7

special attention is given to ensuring cooperation between universities, scientific communities
and industry, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and citizens and their
representatives, in order to bridge gaps between territories, generations and regional cultures,
especially caring for the needs of the young in shaping Europe’s future. Moreover,
accelerating the performance and boosting the use and impact of research and innovation also
requires it to make use of complementary capacities, such as European research, innovation
and space infrastructures and services, or to develop complementary activities in synergy with
other European Union funding programmes. Applicants could consider and actively seek
complementarities and synergies with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding
of additional activities not covered by their proposal from EU, national or regional
programmes such as: EU4Health, Digital Europe Programme, European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF), European Social Fund (ESF+), Structural Reform Support
Programme (SRSP), Just Transition Fund (JTF), European Maritime and Fisheries Fund
(EMFF), European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), European Defence
Fund (EDF) or InvestEU. This could involve dedicated calls (EU synergies calls), meaning
that actions that have been awarded a grant under such a call could have the possibility to also
receive funding under other EU programmes, including relevant shared management funds.
Additionally, to encourage multi-actor approaches and to be more effective in achieving
impact, applicants could consider synergies with other relevant initiatives funded under the
Horizon Europe programme, including the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs)
of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) or the interregional networks
funded under the European Innovation Ecosystems (EIE) component of Pillar III. The
innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the EIT-KICs or the EIE can in particular
contribute to building communities or platforms for coordination and support actions, sharing
knowledge or disseminating and fostering the exploitation of project results. The proposals
are also encouraged to explore other forms and means of service provisions distinct to the
EIT-KICs, in particular EIT-KIC Health and EIT-KIC Digital.
All could help to support the development of skills and capacities in research or health
systems, as well as accelerating the take-up and use of scientific evidence, new technologies
and best practices in health care and by health systems, industries and markets, at national or
regional level.
As examples, the EU4Health programme could help to ensure that the best use is made of
research results and facilitate the uptake, scaling-up and deployment of health innovations in
healthcare systems and clinical practice. Thereby unlocking the potential of innovation in
health, and improving efficiency by avoiding the duplication of activities and optimising the
use of financial resources.
The ERDF focuses, amongst others, on the development and strengthening of regional and
local research and innovation ecosystems and smart economic transformation, in line with
regional/national smart specialisation strategies. It can support investment in research
infrastructure, activities for applied research and innovation, including industrial research,
experimental development and feasibility studies, building research and innovation capacities

and uptake of advanced technologies and roll-out of innovative solutions from the Framework
Programmes for research and innovation through the ERDF9.
The EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) offers support to Member States in
financing reforms and investments that improve their resilience and their growth potential,
mitigate the economic and social impacts from the COVID-19 crisis, including in the area of
health, and support the twin green and digital transitions. For project ideas that go beyond the
remits of an R&I proposal and directly contribute to the objectives of the RRF it is advisable
to check access to funding available at national level in line with the Member States’
approved recovery and resilience plans for a fast and targeted support.
Notwithstanding the synergies mentioned above, the work programme 2023-2024 of cluster 1
‘Health’ captures synergies with other clusters based on the challenges and areas of
intervention of each destination. Further synergies are encouraged with regard to
complementary funding opportunities provided by topics in other clusters and other pillars of
Horizon Europe, notably in the European Research Infrastructure work programme (under
pillar I) and the European Innovation Council work programme (under pillar III). Additional
synergies could also be explored at project-level, i.e. between the portfolio of projects funded
either under the same topic or by establishing a portfolio of projects funded under different
topics (of the health cluster, of the other clusters 2-6, or of the pillars I/III of Horizon Europe).
In particular, applicants to calls of the health cluster are encouraged to consider, where
relevant, the services offered by the current and future EU-funded European Research
Infrastructures, including the European Open Science Cloud.10 11 Moreover, if projects use
satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and
services, they must make use of European space technologies and services provided by
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may additionally be used).12
In the context of the work programme 2023-2024 of cluster 1 ‘Health’, a clinical study covers
clinical studies/trials/investigations/cohorts and is defined as any systematic prospective or
retrospective collection and analysis of health data obtained from individual patients or
healthy persons in order to address scientific questions related to the understanding,
prevention, diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of a disease, mental illness, or physical

536/2014 (on medicinal products), clinical investigation and clinical evaluation as defined by
Regulation 2017/745 (on medical devices), performance study and performance evaluation as
defined by Regulation 2017/746 (on in vitro diagnostic medical devices).
Please note that the European Union (EU) pharmaceutical legislation known as the Clinical
Trials Regulation No 536/201413 entered into application on 31 January 2022, repealing the
Clinical Trials Directive (EC) No. 2001/20/EC and national implementing legislation in the
EU Member States, which regulated clinical trials in the EU until the Regulation's entry into
application. As a result, from 31 January 2023, all initial clinical trial applications in the
European Union (EU) must be submitted via the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS)14.
CTIS is now the single-entry point for sponsors and regulators of clinical trials for the
submission and assessment of clinical trial data.
In the context of the work programme 2023-2024 of cluster 1 ‘Health’, FAIR data are data
which meet principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. Data can
include exploitation of information and data from European data infrastructures and
programmes such as Copernicus, European Space Agency and the GEO initiative. For further
details, see the FAIR principles website15, the FAIR cookbook16 and the guides for
researchers on how to make your data FAIR.17
Where relevant, applicants are encouraged to take advantage of synergies with the Euratom
Research and Training Programme (2021-2025).18
The work programme 2023-2024 of cluster 1 ‘Health’ is directed towards two Key Strategic
Orientations (KSOs) for research and innovation set by Horizon Europe’s strategic plan 2021-
2024, notably to creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society (KSO-
D) and promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of key digital,
enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains (KSO-A). It aims to complete
the targets set out in the Strategic Plan 2021-2024, mainly along the four impact areas: Good
health and high-quality accessible health care; A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats;
High quality digital services for all; and A competitive and secure data-economy. More
specifically, cluster 1 strives to contribute to six expected impacts as set out by the Strategic
Plan, which are the following six destinations of this work programme:
Destination 1 - Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society: Citizens of all ages stay
healthy and independent in a rapidly changing society thanks to healthier lifestyles and

Health
behaviours, healthier diets, healthier environments, improved evidence-based health policies,
and more effective solutions for health promotion and disease prevention.
Destination 2 - Living and working in a health-promoting environment: Living and
working environments are health-promoting and sustainable thanks to better understanding of
environmental, occupational, social and economic determinants of health.
Destination 3 - Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden: Health care providers are
able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and
neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on
patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective
and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic
outbreaks and improved patient safety.
Destination 4 - Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care:
Health care systems provide equal access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health
care thanks to the development and uptake of safe, cost-effective and people-centred
solutions, with a focus on population health, health systems resilience, as well as improved
evidence-based health policies.
Destination 5 - Unlocking the full potential of new tools, technologies and digital
solutions for a healthy society: Health technologies, new tools and digital solutions are
applied effectively thanks to their inclusive, secure and ethical development, delivery,
integration and deployment in health policies and health care systems.
Destination 6 - Maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health-
related industry: EU health industry is innovative, sustainable and globally competitive
thanks to improved up-take of breakthrough technologies and innovations, which makes the
EU with its Member States more resilient and less dependent from imports with regard to the
access to and supply of critical health technologies.

Health
Destination 1 – Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society
Calls for proposals under this destination are directed towards the Key Strategic Orientation
KSO-D ‘Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society’ of Horizon
Europe’s Strategic Plan 2021-2024. Research and innovation supported under this destination
should contribute to the impact area ‘Good health and high-quality accessible health care’
and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health
cluster: ‘citizens of all ages stay healthy and independent in a rapidly changing society thanks
to healthier lifestyles and behaviours, healthier diets, healthier environments, improved
evidence-based health policies, and more effective solutions for health promotion and disease
prevention’. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also
contribute to the following impact areas: ‘High quality digital services for all’, ‘Sustainable
food systems from farm to fork on land and sea’, and ‘Climate change mitigation and
adaptation’.
People´s health care needs are different, depending on their age, stage of life and socio-
economic background. Their physical and mental health and well-being can be influenced by
their individual situation as well as the broader societal context they are living in.
Furthermore, health education and behaviour are important factors. Currently, more than 790
000 deaths per year in Europe are due to risk factors such as smoking, drinking, physical
inactivity, and obesity. Upbringing, income, education levels, social and gender aspects also
have an impact on health risks and how diseases can be prevented. Moreover, people´s health
can be impacted by a rapidly changing society, making it challenging to keep pace and find its
way through new technological tools and societal changes, which both are increasing
demands on the individual´s resilience. In order to leave no one behind, to reduce health
inequalities and to support healthy and active lives for all, it is crucial to provide suitable and
tailor-made solutions, including for people with specific needs. Preventing diseases from
developing in the first place is at the core of successful public health programmes in the
future.
As set out in the Strategic Plan 2021-2024, destination 1 focuses on major societal challenges
that are part of the European Commission’s political priorities. This is why destination 1 in
the work programme 2021-2022 covered immediate urgencies, notably a better understanding
and prevention of mental illness, prevention of obesity, digital empowerment in health
literacy, understanding the transition from health to disease and making use of AI tools to
predict the risk for onset and progression of chronic diseases. The work programme 2023-
2024 will complete the ambitions of the Strategic Plan by focussing on holistic and integrated
approaches to disease prevention and health promotion, notably healthy ageing, on a life
course approach to physical and mental health starting in early childhood and on personalised
approaches to prevention of diseases.
More specifically, research and innovation supported under this destination will provide new
tools, digitally enabled solutions and evidence-based health and care services to prevent and
delay progression of age-related diseases. Research and innovation will also provide tailor

made strategies and solutions to support children and adolescents adopting and maintaining
person-centred healthy lifestyles. Specific measures will be developed to educate and
empower citizens of all ages and throughout their life to play an active role in the self-
management of their own health and self-care, to the benefit of an active and healthy ageing.
This destination will also call for proposals specifically aiming to develop integrated and
holistic personalised disease prevention strategies, making use of multiple data sources,
including real-world health data. This initiative will build on the impressive advances made in
the area of personalised medicine to treat diseases, but here the focus will be on personalised
approaches to prevent rather than treat diseases.
Dialogue and coordination between stakeholders and policymakers as well as integration
across different settings will be needed to develop more effective cross-sectoral solutions for
holistic approaches to health promotion and disease prevention and deliver improved
evidence-based health for all.
In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European
Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable
cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities
such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and
adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential
synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic, but also between other projects
funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe. In particular, this could
involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon
Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of
Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of
Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 2 “Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society” such
as on health inequalities, on other inequalities affecting health, or on citizens’ behaviour and
engagement; with cluster 4 “Digital, Industry and Space” such as on digital tools,
telemedicine or smart homes; with cluster 5 “Climate, Energy and Mobility” such as on urban
health or on mitigating the impact of road traffic accidents and related injuries; with cluster 6
“Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment” such as on the role of
nutrition for health (incl. human microbiome, mal- and over-nutrition, safe food), personalised
diets (incl. food habits in general and childhood obesity in particular) and the impact of food-
related environmental stressors on human health (incl. marketing and consumer habits).19
Expected impacts:
Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to
staying healthy in a rapidly changing society, and more specifically to one or several of the
following impacts:
• Citizens adopt healthier lifestyles and behaviours, make healthier choices and maintain
longer a healthy, independent and active life with a reduced disease burden, including at
old ages or in other vulnerable stages of life.

Health
• Citizens are able and empowered to manage better their own physical and mental health
and well-being, monitor their health, and interact with their doctors and health care
providers.
• Children and adolescents are empowered to better monitor and manage their physical,
social and mental health with a view to lifelong healthy lifestyles.
• Society benefits from reduced economic and health burden from avoidable sickness,
disease and premature death. Efficiency is increased by targeting scarce resources in
appropriate, cost-effective ways, to areas of high social return, contributing to an
improvement and optimisation of health and well-being of citizens and reduction of
health inequalities.
• Citizens´ trust in knowledge-based health interventions and in guidance from health
authorities is strengthened, including through improved health literacy, resulting in
increased engagement in and adherence to effective strategies for health promotion,
disease prevention and treatment, while digital literacy inequalities are minimised.
• Health policies and actions for health promotion and disease prevention are knowledge-
based, people-centred, personalised and thus targeted and tailored to citizens' needs, and
designed to reduce health inequalities.

Health
• Citizens and patients will get effective, preventive, integrated, coordinated, evidence-
based and people-centred high-quality health and care services to identify and tackle or
prevent multi-morbidities, frailty, biologically or mentally reduced capacities, (sensory)
impairments, dementia and/or neurodegeneration, fostering mental and physical health,
wellbeing and quality of life. These could include, but are not limited to, assistive
technologies, nutrition and physical activity, adaptation of work and workplace, health-
promoting age-friendly working, home and community environments, better equality of
access to health and care services through community-based and integrated care models,
also digitally enabled.
• Primary and community-based health and care services will be better equipped to early
identify people at risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and multi-
morbidities. They will have integrated and cost-effective intervention tools to help
prevent, monitor and manage progression of age-related diseases, conditions and
disabilities, while promoting healthy lifestyles, ageing in place23, as well as physical and
mental wellbeing among the elderly.
• Older people, including those receiving long-term care, will be empowered to take an
active role in the management of their own physical and mental health, as well as
increase their social interactions and wellbeing through better health literacy, educational
programmes, trainings and platforms, including with the help of innovative and digitally
enabled solutions.
• Citizens, all relevant stakeholders, public authorities, cities and rural environments, as
well as health care providers will be engaged to ensure the introduction to and the
integration of age-friendly, mental and physical health promoting innovative care
pathways and digitally enabled solutions into the daily life and wellbeing of the ageing
population, with the aim of leaving no-one behind.
The proposals should provide appropriate indicators to measure performance and progress
towards the relevant expected outcomes.
Scope: This topic aims to implement strategies and actions in line with the Green Paper on
Ageing24, the EU Long-term care report25, the ‘Healthier Together’ – EU Non-Communicable
Diseases Initiative26, the new EU Care Strategy27, which strive to address demographic
change and enable better health and care for Europe’s growing ageing societies, as well as to
harness the potential of the Silver Economy28. NCD prevention is highly relevant to reduce
23 ‘The ability to live in one's own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably,
regardless of age, income, or ability level’.

the need for long-term care. New tools and integrated care models are needed, reinforcing
primary, community- and home-based health and long-term care provision, through better
early detection and management of diseases among older people in an increasingly ageing
society and overburdened health and care systems.
The topic encourages the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well
as of European, national and regional authorities and civil society, in order to strengthen the
scientific and technological expertise of SMEs in the health and care domain, promote the
European Health- and Age-Tech; and improve the uptake of innovative health and care
solutions in the EU and Associated Countries.
The applicants should ensure that the developed solutions, technologies and adoption policies
are driven by the needs of citizens and patients of old age and ensure their involvement. Co-
creation, co-design with end-users and particular consideration of the diversity of the needs,
mental and physical abilities, living and socio-economic conditions as well as life-situations
of older people are required, including provision of training to citizens, patients, formal and
informal carers.
The proposed research and innovation should focus on all of the following aspects:
• Consolidate high-quality effective, integrated, innovative and digitally enabled person-
centred health and long-term care services and solutions, both in primary care, hospital
and home settings, around older people's needs for physical and mental health, care and
wellbeing, strengthened disease prevention, rehabilitation and for staying active and
healthy as people age. Such integrated and holistic solutions could include, but are not
limited to, integrated care solutions, serious games, connected wearables, ambient
sensors, social robots, assistive technologies, age-friendly environments, diagnostic
screenings, self-monitoring devices, robotics and others29, tackling age-related physical
and mental diseases and co-morbidities.
• Develop and provide evidenced-based new approaches, coordinated care models and
pathways, for delivering effective, person-centred health and long-term care solutions at
the system and community level. These should be based on the needs of healthy and
vulnerable older people for increased physical, mental and nutritional resilience vis-à-vis
inequality of access to health and care, rapidly changing societies and health and care
systems, and ensure better skills, empowerment and improved health and digital literacy
through appropriate trainings and activities.
• Support adoption and market innovation of novel health and care solutions, co-created
with and designed for older age-related health conditions. The support could be provided
through large-scale testing and deployment piloting, guidance on relevant HTA and CE
procedures, demonstrating cost-effectiveness, as well as through stakeholder
involvement and policy collaboration on European 30 , local, regional 31 , and

international32,33 level, exchange of best practices (twinnings), and, when relevant,
collaboration with the EC-funded large-scale pilots on Active and Healthy Living34 and
the Reference Sites Collaborative Network.
This topic addresses consortia including research partners and innovative technology
providers, such as SMEs and/or organisations that can offer the range of activities required to
address the objectives of the topic; the latter could for example be based on Digital Innovation
Hubs, digital health accelerators, incubators and knowledge hubs, Centres offering Pilot Lines
or similar technology, business and/or knowledge transfer organisations.
The proposals should be highly integrated, ambitious, go beyond simple networking and
provide appropriate indicators to measure progress, impact, cost-effectiveness and adoption in
the Europe. Dissemination and involvement of policymakers, both at national and regional
level, as well as civil society organisations in a European wide geographical balanced matter
is essential, as the results of this action are expected to have European wide impact.
Selected projects under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as
appropriate. These joint activities could, for example, take the form of clustering of projects
and involve joint coordination and dissemination activities such as the participation in joint
workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices and
adoption strategies on regional, national and European level. The details of these joint
activities will be defined during the grant preparation phase with the European Commission.
Applicants should plan a necessary budget to cover this collaboration.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.
Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical
studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. See

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several impacts of destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”. To
that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed at,
tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
• Children, adolescents and their parents/carers are educated and empowered in prevention
strategies involving personalised approaches and solutions (also through the use of
digital tools) to manage, maintain and improve children’s and adolescents' own health,
physical activity, nutrition habits, leisure needs, mental and social well-being, in full
respect of the privacy of individuals.
• Children and adolescents, including those from vulnerable contexts, monitor their health
risks, adopt healthy lifestyles at home, at school and in the community and interact with
their doctors and carers (receiving and providing feedback), also through the means of
digitally enabled solutions, better health literacy, training and critical thinking.
• Thanks to better co-creation, training, digital and health literacy, children, adolescents,
parents and carers across Europe access and use person-centred, widely available
solutions for children and adolescents’ health, care and wellbeing, appropriate to a
rapidly changing and increasingly digitalised society, also considering the risk of digital
addiction.
The proposals should provide appropriate indicators to measure the progress towards the
relevant expected outcomes.
Scope: Laying the ground for a healthy life starts in childhood. Accordingly, and in line with
the HealthyLifestyles4All Initiative38, the ‘Healthier Together’ – EU Non-Communicable
Diseases Initiative39, and the Communication of the Commission on enabling the Digital
Transformation of Health and Care40,41, the main goal of the research and innovation should

be to promote healthier societies by developing holistic solutions that foster healthy lifestyles
from early age with long-term impact(s).
Digitalisation poses risks but can also be a driving force for empowering young citizens, who
are growing up in an increasingly digitised world, in taking an active role in the management
of their own health conditions, mental and social well-being, and promote healthy lives and
disease prevention, through innovative solutions, coordinated person-centred care models and
better health literacy.
The topic encourages the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well
as of European, national and regional authorities and civil society, in order to strengthen the
scientific and technological expertise of SMEs in the health and care domain to promote the
uptake of innovative health and care solutions in Europe.
The proposed research and innovation should focus on several of the following aspects:
• Develop and advance person-centred, evidence-based and coordinated disease
prevention intervention solutions to support children and adolescents’ health and care in
an increasingly digital society. The effectiveness of the intervention solutions should be
evaluated, inter alia, in terms of health outcomes, (comparative) cost-effectiveness,
implementation facilitators and barriers. The target group should include children and
adolescents up to 25 years of age from different socio-economic backgrounds.
• Develop and integrate innovative, privacy preserving tools and technologies, such as
(but not limited to) activity trackers, sensors, serious games, platforms and robotics,
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in coordinated and integrated care models, to
help children and adolescents lead healthy, active and social lifestyles, prevent diseases,
as well as to better monitor and manage their physical, social and mental health.
Empower children and adolescents to navigate the health and care systems, interact with
their doctors, formal and informal carers, social circles, as well as better manage their
own health at home, in the community and at school, taking into account specific youth
psychiatric risk factors, the risk of addiction, as well as the geographic, social and
economic determinants of health and digital literacy inequities.
• Stimulate the adoption of person-centred approaches and solutions for better health, care
and well-being of children and adolescents, by including stakeholders from all the
relevant sectors (including but not limited to education, leisure, social innovation,
healthcare, Medtech, media and citizens) in the co-creation, design, planning and
adoption of the solutions, as well as the training of their end-users.
• Develop and disseminate evidence-based guidance and tools for children and adolescents
promoting healthy balance between a sedentary digitised lifestyle and a more active non-
digitised lifestyle in support of their physical, mental and social health and well-being on
short- and long-term basis.

• Develop, implement (pilot and/or scale-up) and promote person-centred tools and
interventions for better physical and mental wellbeing, addressing the risks of digital
addiction and overconsumption, isolation and mental illness, by promoting physical,
intellectual or artistic activities, social interaction and providing mental health support
and treatment.
In all instances, gender as well as demographic, geographic and socio-economic aspects
should be duly taken into account.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise and the involvement of youth throughout the project in order to
produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related
research activities.
Moreover, greater involvement of non-health sectors directly affecting risk factors and
determinants of health, for example (physical) environment, food and nutrition, security,
education, sports, finance, industry is desirable/encouraged, as relevant.
Proposals should be highly integrated, ambitious, go beyond simple networking and provide
appropriate indicators to measure progress and impact.
Selected projects under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as
appropriate. These joint activities could, for example, take the form of clustering of projects
and involve joint coordination and dissemination activities such as the participation in joint
workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices and
adoption strategies on regional, national and European level. The details of these joint
activities will be defined during the grant preparation phase with the Commission. Applicants
should plan a necessary budget to cover this collaboration.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several impacts of destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”. To
that end, proposals under this topic should aim at delivering results that are directed at,
tailored towards and contributing to several of the following expected outcomes:
• Citizens have access to and use effective personalised prevention schemes and health
counselling (including through digital means) that take into account their individual
characteristics and situation. Individuals can be assigned to particular groups based on
their characteristics, and receive advice adequate to that group. Stratification of a
population into groups showing similar traits allows for effective personalised disease
prevention.
• Health professionals use effective, tried and tested tools to facilitate their work when
advising both patients and healthy individuals. Public health programme owners gain
insight into the specificities and characteristics of disease clusters within the population
through stratification. This can then be used to facilitate the identification of population
groups with elevated risk of developing certain diseases and improve the programmes,
update them and design effective strategies for optimal solutions and interventions.
• National and regional programmes make better use of funds, data infrastructure and
personnel in health promotion and disease prevention, primary and secondary healthcare.
They can consider the use of new or improved ambitious policy and intervention options,
with expected high population-wide impact, for effective health promotion and disease
prevention.
• Companies generate opportunities for new product and service developments to cater to
the needs of the healthcare service and individuals.
Scope: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for the majority of the disease
burden in Europe and are the leading cause of avoidable premature death. The human and
financial cost of NCDs is high and expected to grow. Reducing the burden of NCDs requires a
holistic approach and tackling health inequalities across the board. Preventing NCDs from
developing in the first place will be at the core of successful public health programmes in the
future.
Personalised approaches and the development of targeted interventions have led to an
impressive progress in several fields of medicine and have been included in many treatments.
However, the use of stratification and individualisation in guiding prevention strategies is still
not widely in use even though examples of its potential are accumulating. Identifying people
at risk of developing a particular disease before the disease starts to manifest itself with
symptoms greatly improves treatment options. It is estimated that about two thirds of all
NCDs are preventable, many affecting people who are unaware of their disease risks or do not
have access to information pertaining to the management of the condition.
Part 4 - Page 27 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
Personalised prevention is the assessment of health risks for individuals based on their
specific background traits43 to recommend tailored prevention44. This can include any
evidence-based method45. Personalised prevention strategies complement general public
health prevention programmes without replacing them, optimising the benefit of both
approaches. Personalised prevention is ideally suited to the use of large data sets,
computational and omics approaches, with design and use of algorithms, integrating in-depth
biological and medical information, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and ‘virtual
twin’ technology, taking into account explainable and transparent AI46.
The funded projects will work towards reducing the burden of NCDs in line with the
‘Healthier Together’ – EU Non-Communicable Diseases Initiative47. This does not limit the
scope of projects under this topic to particular diseases as any disease area of interest, co-
morbidities and health determinants48 can be addressed.
Accordingly, the proposed research is expected to deliver on all of the following points:
• Enable the understanding of areas of unmet need in NCDs prevention, possibly also
addressing disease mechanism, management of disease progression and relapse.
Providing new approaches for prevention, focussing on the digitally supported
personalised dimension, that can be adopted and scaled up.
• Devise new or improved ambitious policy and intervention options, with expected high
population-wide impact on the target groups in question. To be proposed and made
available for effective health promotion and disease prevention including targeted
communication strategies to successfully reach out to the risk groups.
• Design an integrated, holistic approach that includes several of the following aspects:
genetic predisposition to NCDs, meta-genomics, epigenomics, the microbiome,
metabolomics, sleep disorders, large cohorts, molecular profiling in longitudinal health
screening, impact of lack of physical activity, novel predictive biomarker candidates,
diets and nutrition, eating habits for designing customised dietary patterns (geographical
variation), and the influence of choice environment on personal choices.
• Study the ethical, legal and social aspects as well as health economics of the
personalised prevention tools and programmes being developed. Consider optimal health
counselling and communication to the patients/citizens. Address legal aspects of
balancing the right not to know and the obligation of helping people in danger.
Furthermore, the proposed research is expected to deliver on several of the following points:
43 (Epi-)genetic, biological, environmental, lifestyle, social, behavioural, etc.
44 Possibly along with digitally supported disease management schemes.
45 For example: medication, diet programmes, early diagnostics, monitoring, lifestyle advice and
modification, specific training/exercise, psychosocial interventions, meditation, etc.

• Develop and validate effective strategies to prevent NCDs and optimise health and well-
being of citizens (including the most vulnerable). Propose the strategies to policymakers
along with mechanisms to monitor their progress. The strategies need to be aligned with
relevant national and European health laws and policies.
• Provide scientific evidence on interactions between the genetic predisposition to
multifactorial diseases and environmental factors or environmental triggers. Propose
scientifically supported personalised prevention strategies that ensure how to modify the
environmental drivers of behavioural risk factors.
• Develop new computational tools combining and analysing comprehensive data with
different dimensions49 to identify risk factors and modifiers. Creating procedures and
algorithms to combine information from different sources (with standardised common
data models) to generate risk scores for several diseases and provide health promotion
recommendations for the individual as advised by healthcare professionals. Furthermore,
develop advanced computational modelling techniques50 for predicting disease risk and
predisposition (addressed together in an integrative approach) and identifying the
optimal solution/intervention for different target groups and individuals.
• Develop tools and techniques to increase the efficiency and cost- effectiveness of on the
one hand interventions, adjusting their scope, characteristics and resources, and on the
other hand healthcare infrastructure and how it promotes and delivers health promotion,
disease prevention, and care effectively to the different population groups.
• Design tools to collect various data to advance health promotion and disease prevention
and strategies for providing omics essays for the general patient with a focus on cost-
effectiveness and flexibility.
• Determine how to optimise the benefits of physical activity, smart monitoring of
physical activity and sedentary behaviour with measurable data, addressing barriers to
uptake and implementation of healthy lifestyles in daily life, understanding what
promotion methods work and why, behavioural science to understand healthier choice
environments. Balancing the ecosystem associated with the economic, social, and health
consequences of NCDs. Affordability related consideration should be taken into account
to ensure accessibility of new tools and techniques.
• Conduct data mining of real-world data and develop quantifiable and distinguishable
indicators from wearables data, taking into account ‘light-weight’ AI means to ensure
patient privacy and short reaction times.
49 For example, genomic, biomarkers, metagenomics, diet, synthetic data, lifestyle, wearables (physical
activity), mental health, gender, age, physical and social environment.

Destination 2. Living and working in a health-promoting environment
Calls for proposals under this destination are directed towards the Key Strategic Orientation
KSO-D ‘Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society’ of Horizon
Europe’s Strategic Plan 2021-2024. Research and innovation supported under this destination
should contribute to the impact area ‘A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats’ and in
particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster:
‘living and working environments are health-promoting and sustainable thanks to better
understanding of environmental, occupational, social and economic determinants of health’.
In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to
the following impact areas: ‘Good health and high-quality accessible health care’, ‘Climate
change mitigation and adaptation’, and ‘Clean and healthy air, water and soil’. The
environment we live and work in is a major determinant of our health and well-being.
Environmental factors are estimated to account for almost 20% of all deaths in Europe. The
impacting factors on both physical and mental health and wellbeing are not all identified nor
their effects comprehensively understood and accounted for to support evidence-based policy-
and decision-making. Therefore, Destination 2 aims at filling knowledge gaps in the
understanding of the impacts on our health and well-being of those environmental,
occupational and socio-economic risk factors that have the most significant or widespread
societal impacts. In this work programme, Destination 2 focuses on pollution, disrupting
chemicals, environmental degradation, climate and other environmental exposures in living
and working environments. The results will support the EU’s environment and health policies
and overarching policy frameworks such as the European Green Deal, the Chemical Strategy
for Sustainability, the EU Adaptation Strategy, the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, the 8th
Environment Action Programme, the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work
as well as the WHO European Environment and Health Process (EHP). Strong collaborations
across sectors and with other Horizon Europe clusters dealing with issues such as agriculture,
food, environment, climate, biodiversity, mobility, security, urban planning, social inclusion
and gender will be needed to ensure that maximal societal benefits are reached. Thus, in view
of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission
welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation
and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the
participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, development and adoption of
best practices, or joint communication activities. All topics are open to international
collaboration to address global environment and health challenges.
Expected impacts:
Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to
living and working in a health-promoting environment, and more specifically to one or
several of the following impacts:
Part 4 - Page 31 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Policymakers and regulators are aware and well informed about environmental, socio-
economic and occupational risk factors as well as health-promoting factors across
society;
• Environmental, occupational, social, economic, fiscal and health policies and practices at
the EU, national and regional level are sustainable and based on solid scientific
evidence. These include overarching policy frameworks such as the European Green
Deal, the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability, the 8th Environment Action Programme,
the EU Adaptation Strategy, the Farm to Fork Strategy53, the EU Biodiversity Strategy
2030, the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work and the European
Environment and Health Process led by the World Health Organization;
• The upstream determinants of disease - related to choices in energy generation,
agricultural and food processing practices, industrial production, land use planning, built
environment and construction - are known, understood and reduced;
• The health threats and burden resulting from hazardous chemicals, biodiversity
degradation and air, water and soil pollution and contamination is reduced, so that the
related number of deaths and illnesses is substantially reduced by 2030;
• Living and working environments in European cities and regions are healthier, more
inclusive, safer, resilient and sustainable;
• The adaptive capacity and resilience of populations and health systems in Europe to
climate and environmental change-related health risks is strengthened;
• Citizens’ health and well-being is protected and promoted, and premature deaths,
diseases and inequalities related to environmental pollution and degradation as well as
unhealthy lifestyles are prevented;
• Citizens understand better complex environment and health issues, and effective
measures to address them and support related policies and regulation.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 2 ‘Living and working in a health-promoting
environment’. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:
• Climate and environmental policies are supported with better knowledge on the Earth
natural systems and human health interactions;
• Sustainable planetary health policies which foster co-benefits to human health and the
health of ecosystems are supported with robust evidence;
• Cross sectorial and multidisciplinary scientific collaborations, including expertise in
public health and One Health, are established;
• Public authorities rely on indicators about the impacts on human health of changes or
degradation of natural systems to support adaptation and mitigation strategies to natural
hazards;

• Policymakers have better tools to improve the predictive capability and preparedness as
well as to envision prevention strategies to deal with the impacts on human health of
changes or degradation of ecosystems;
• Citizens are engaged and informed about the impact of natural systems’ degradation on
human health and behaviours aiming at the conservation of ecosystems are promoted.
Scope: Globally, life quality and expectancy have increased to unprecedented levels over the
last decades due to the significant public health, agricultural, industrial and technological
achievements of the 20th century. On the other hand, the ongoing trend of environmental
degradation and global climate and environmental changes has introduced new pressures,
which involve large impacts on human health and might put at risk the recent public health
gains.
Among others, climate change, biodiversity loss, biological invasions, environmental
pollution, changes in land use and degradation, deforestation, thawing permafrost (in polar
regions, and particularly in the Arctic), overfishing, new animal diseases and acidification of
water bodies can result in reduced food and water availability and safety and increased
exposure to factors causing infectious and non-communicable diseases. Additionally, changes
in weather and climate extremes have been observed across the globe, resulting in an increase
of the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heavy precipitation and
floods, heat waves and hot extremes, droughts and tropical cyclones.
There is increasing evidence showing that many of these environmental stressors and changes
can cause profound short- and long-term negative impacts on human health and well-being,
contributing to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding and acting upon
these challenges calls for a multidisciplinary, cross-sectorial and trans-border approach
ranging from the local to the global scale. The effects can be direct due to increases in floods,
heatwaves, water shortages, landslides, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, exposure to
pollutants, among others, or indirect and complex, as climate change -mediated or ecosystem-
mediated. In addition, it is imperative that the solutions and initiatives chosen to prevent
environmental degradation are safe for human health and the environment.
Planetary health is a concept focused on the interdependencies between human health and the
state of earth’s complex natural systems. A key focus is on understanding how the current
trend of human-related environmental degradation can affect the health and well-being of
current and future generations. The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary
Health60 published a report in 2015, laying the foundation for the development of this
important new field of study61. In 2020 the Helsinki declaration62 was published, resulting
60 https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(15)60901-1.pdf
61 “Our definition of planetary health is the achievement of the highest attainable standard of health, well-
being, and equity worldwide through judicious attention to the human systems—political, economic,
and social—that shape the future of humanity and the Earth’s natural systems that define the safe
environmental limits within which humanity can flourish. Put simply, planetary health is the health of
human civilisation and the state of the natural systems on which it depends”

from a conference where participants discussed how to implement the planetary health
approach in Europe in the context of the European Green Deal. Planetary health is also a
priority topic in the research agenda in environment, climate and health proposed by the
Coordination and support action HERA63.
Applicants are invited to submit proposals providing actionable evidence for policymakers to
take preventive actions to protect the human health and wellbeing by exploring the links
between human health and environmental degradation in an integrated and comprehensive
manner. More fragmented contributions focused on less studied aspects such as the links
between climate change and health and, between biodiversity and health, will also be
considered.
To advance the knowledge on planetary health to support policymaking in this area, the
applicants should address several of the following activities:
• Provide strengthened evidence for health and wellbeing impacts of planetary changes,
considering a systems thinking framework or a fragmentary approach focused on the
impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss on human health (for biodiversity loss,
proposals should not focus on the connection between the biodiversity loss and
ecosystem degradation with the prevention of zoonotic emerging diseases since this
topic will be covered by CL6-2023-BIODIV: Interlinkages between biodiversity loss and
degradation of ecosystems and the emergence of zoonotic diseases);
• Provide improved understanding and modelling of human–ecological systems
interactions and ecosystem-mediated effects on human health and well-being, including
the attribution of health outcomes to environmental change;
• Provide a methodology to identify and prioritise threats for public health caused by
environmental degradation, with a view to improving preparedness of health systems to
these threats, through structured processes that move from evidence to recommendations
and decisions;
• Investigation how infections agents that might have the capacity to adapt to other host
species can spread via the environment, and how this type of insight might lead to
enhanced monitoring strategies;
• Lay the foundations for integrated surveillance systems considering already established
monitoring systems (e.g. systematic wastewater monitoring) and using available and
newly collected health, socioeconomic, and environmental data for defined populations
over longer time periods. This would provide early detection of emerging disease
outbreaks (e.g. zoonotic diseases, potential permafrost release of new and old pathogens)
or changes in nutrition and non-communicable disease burden and support the
assessment of the integrated health, environmental, and socioeconomic effect of policies
and technologies.

Health
• Explore strategies to reduce environmental damage and harmful emissions (e.g. air
pollution) including assessment of health co-benefits through engagement with relevant
HE partnerships and missions;
• Explore implications of planetary health for health systems and public health and
identify opportunities to mitigate adverse health impacts of environmental degradation;
• Improve risk communication to policymakers, public authorities, industry and the public
and support evidence-informed decisions by policymakers, by increasing capacity to do
systematic reviews and provide rigorous policy briefs;
• Advance knowledge and actions to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases
while reducing the environmental pressure in areas like nutrition, physical activity, and
mobility, and to assess the integrated health, environmental, and socioeconomic effect of
those actions (i.e. behaviour change interventions, policies or new technologies);
• Provide better understanding on adaptation to climate and other environmental changes
to protect human health, including the interactions between different planetary
boundaries and the need to integrate adaptation and mitigation strategies;
• Improved health impact assessment approaches accounting for environmental
externalities and estimating the cost and benefits of interventions versus no action.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities. Researchers should carefully integrate
distributive considerations in their analysis by considering, where relevant, disaggregated
effects for different socio-economic groups.
In order to optimise synergies and increase the impact of the projects, all projects selected for
funding from this topic will form a cluster and be required to participate in common
networking and joint activities. Without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities,
proposals should allocate a sufficient budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 2 ‘Living and working in a health-promoting
environment’. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:
• Public authorities and regulators are supported with evidence-based guidance to design
occupational health policies;
• Public authorities, employers, organisations and social partners (e.g. trade unions and
employer organisations) are better supported with tools, evidence-based intervention
options and guidelines to promote mental and physical well-being and health in the
workplace;
• Public authorities and the scientific community have access to FAIR data64 and robust
evidence on direct links between psychosocial and physical risk factors at the workplace
(considering also individual differences such as age, gender, cultural background,
bodily/cognitive abilities) and specific health outcomes;
• Public authorities, regulators and social partners are informed by evidence on the costs,
benefits, sustainability and expected challenges of available solutions;
• Public authorities and employers take advantage of the best available knowledge
(including new innovations and ways for action) to support interventions and solutions
on the design of the built working environment and promote healthier behaviours at the
workplace;
• Public authorities and employers develop adequate measures to prevent and reduce the
negative outcomes of exposure to psycho-social and physical risk factors in the
workplace and support recovery;
• Workers are more protected against work-related hazards and informed about effective
prevention approaches based on specific and appropriate measures and health enhancing
behaviours;
• Workers living with a chronic disease and/or recovering from a mental of physical health
problem are supported to continue/return to work.
Scope: The digital and green transitions (referred to as ‘twin transition’) have been changing
the workplace at a rapid pace, leading to new forms of work (e.g. hybrid work, gig economy
jobs) or changes in the forms of management and work organisation (e.g. through algorithmic
decision-making and digital worker performance monitoring) for workers across the
spectrum. These changes have varying impacts on the working conditions, income and health
and occupational safety both for skilled and unskilled workers. Furthermore, they contribute
to the high costs of work-related illnesses and accidents for employers and the European
economy in general.

Health
Mental health and ergonomic-related problems affect a significant number of EU workers.
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the most common work-related health problems
in the EU and workers and managers commonly identify stress, depression and anxiety as
serious psychosocial outcomes of workplace exposures. Changes in the organisation of work
can bring flexibility that allows more people to enter the labour force, but may also lead to
psychosocial problems (for example, insecurity, compromised privacy and rest time,
inadequate OSH and social protection, as well as stress due to excessive or atypical working
hours, performance monitoring by algorithms and similar AI applications).
Some workplaces have either become exclusively virtual or they have evolved into a ‘hybrid’
model (e.g. multilocational working, home office), some work tasks and processes performed
virtually and others requiring physical presence65. A significant number of jobs are performed
at clients’ premises or require workers to commute long distances and/or cross borders
regularly. Such workers are facing additional legal, social, environmental and economic
issues. Data on how these affect their mental/physical health and well-being is scarce.
The emergence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of
change, causing, in some cases, additional challenges for workers’ mental health
(differentially affecting certain segments of the working force) and intensifying already
existing physical risk factors (e.g. ergonomic risks). The European Pillar of Social Rights
Action Plan66 aims to promote a healthy, safe and well-adapted work environment in the EU
and relies on Horizon Europe for research and innovation supporting economic and social
resilience and sustainability. The EU strategic framework on health and safety at work 2021-
202767 recognises the needs, challenges and opportunities that technological innovation and
the pandemic bring for the working population and calls for strengthening the evidence-base
for policymaking and implementation.
To address the issues described above, research actions under this topic should include several
of the following activities:
• Provide adequate and robust data on the impact (positive and negative) that the ongoing
changes in the workplace are having on the mental and physical health of different
categories of workers and working sectors (e.g. teleworkers, cross-border commuters,
gig economy workers, and vulnerable groups such as women, migrants and young and
older workers with increased demonstrated risk for MSDs), including gender and
intersectional analyses, where appropriate;
• Generate evidence (including data) not only on mental health, but also on mental well-
being at the workplace and how changing work organisation due to the twin transitions
and the pandemic affects workers’ work-life balance and work ability;

caused by new working environments, static postures and physical inactivity, physically
strenuous and highly repetitive work arising from the workplace design) in the
development of chronic and acute diseases;
• Increase the understanding of the links between different health-promoting factors in the
working-built environment and physical and mental health outcomes, and how these may
be mutually reinforcing;
• Explore the health impacts of changing working times, including excessive and atypical
working hours and work in different time zones that blur work from leisure time,
limiting recovery. Effects should consider a wide range of diseases;
• Provide recommendations for effective interventions to prevent occupational risks and
support the mental and physical health and well-being at individual (worker),
organisation (employer) and policy (government) levels for different sectors/types of
work, including an analysis on their cost-effectiveness, sustainability and barriers to
implementation at national and/or EU level;
• Advance the development of a scientific framework addressing Occupational safety and
health (OSH) across policies and sectors and support new and sustainable (future-proof)
tools, guidelines and policies concerning the evaluation and design of physical and
psychosocial work environment;
• Provide tools and approaches to anticipate new OSH risks, also taking account of lessons
learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance in relation to digital technologies and
associated new ways of working.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the

Health
Scope: The function and regulation of the endocrine system in humans and other species is of
high biological complexity. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs or endocrine disruptors)
are chemical substances that alter the functioning of the endocrine system and negatively
affect the health of humans and animals. They may either be of synthetic or natural origin.
EDCs are of increasing importance in chemical regulations in the European Union. According
to the Comprehensive European Union Framework on Endocrine Disruptors, adopted in 2018,
the EU strategic approach on endocrine disruptors for the years to come should be based on
the application of the precautionary principle. This approach would aim at, inter alia,
minimising overall exposure of humans and the environment to endocrine disruptors, paying
particular attention to exposures during important periods of development of an organism,
such as foetal development and puberty, possibly integrating a life course approach, as well as
accelerating the development of a thorough research basis for effective and forward-looking
decision-making. This includes research for the further management of chemicals (including
multi-constituent chemicals as well as chemical mixtures), the understanding of the
mechanistic effects of endocrine disruptors and their dose-response relationships (including at
the molecular and cellular level through the use of new approach methodologies, such as
‘multiomics’, cheminformatics, in vitro 2D and 3D models, in vivo models and computational
approaches), and the collection, sharing, harmonisation and combination of robust data
sources.
Closing existing knowledge gaps in the understanding of EDC effects will support more
effective and evidence-based regulations at the European level.
Bringing together, inter alia, (molecular) epidemiologists, exposure scientists, toxicologists,
endocrinologists, health care practitioners and risk assessors, research actions under this topic
should focus on the understanding of the impact of exposures at critical life stages as regards
development of diseases later in life, focusing on the several health endpoints for which there
is currently less information available. Advantage should be taken of existing biobanks and
disease registries and/or cohorts, with carefully planned measurement strategies and clearly
worked-out hypotheses. The nature of the dose-response relationships and whether effects are
threshold-dependent should be addressed in the study designs. Similarities between endocrine
systems and certain health outcomes across species should be exploited to improve
understanding of functioning of the endocrine system. Finally, research should attempt at
identifying predictive biomarkers (e.g. from liquid biopsies such as saliva, urine, blood) that
would allow the tracing of endocrine disrupter-mediated health effects in a shorter period of
time than normally would be required for epidemiological studies.
Research actions under this topic should provide forward-looking mechanistic information on
potential hazards and health risks of exposures to EDCs, through innovative molecular
epidemiological, multifactorial models and systems biology approaches, exploiting the use of
state of the art non-animal methodologies when relevant, and should include several of the
following activities:
• Studying the impact of EDCs on target organs and in multi-organ models, and
physiological barriers, such as the placenta, the blood-brain barrier, the blood-saliva
Part 4 - Page 46 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
barrier, intestinal, pulmonary and immune cells as well as their interaction with
microbiota. This should include the provision of a thorough understanding of dose-
response relationships;
• Elucidating health endpoints for which insufficient data exist, such as disturbances in the
development and functioning of the nervous and cardiovascular systems, the immune
system, bone development and disease, obesity, diabetes, hormone-dependent cancers
and fertility (e.g. minipuberty, prepuberty and puberty);
• Providing better biological and imaging biomarkers to predict EDC-mediated health
outcomes, including the quantitative probabilities of having an adverse effect based on
such biomarkers;
• Gaining better insights into the developmental origins of health and disease, especially
for those where less data are available. Assessing the occurrence and relevance of multi-
and transgenerationally inherited effects, including molecular and epigenetic
mechanisms that drive multigenerational effects;
• Gaining better insights into the most sensitive windows of susceptibility, during which
exposure are of particular importance for health effects;
• Better understanding of the effects of chemicals and chemical mixtures on the
underlying mechanistic crosstalk between endocrine axes, endocrine pathways and other
key biological systems, including immune, neurological and metabolic functions;
• Improving the understanding of chemical mixture effects, including with other toxins
and at low doses. The role of the microbiome in the activation or detoxification of these
chemicals should be explored where relevant.
• Investigating biological effects of realistic mixtures to get a more detailed understanding
of the endocrine effectome, taking advantage of computational toxicology and
development of up-to-date models;
• Performing comparative analysis between species, assessing similarities to human
endocrine system and health outcomes and exploiting non-mammalian species as test
organisms, e.g. non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates to predict effects or raise
concern about potential effects in humans or vice versa;
• Exploiting systems biology approaches in order to understand how exposure to an EDC
results in an altered phenotype, a process that implies complex interactions across
multiple levels of biological organisation.
Aspects such as gender, regional variations, socioeconomics and culture should be
considered, where appropriate. Proposals should ensure that chemical monitoring data are
shared in IPCHEM74 through involvement with the European Commission's Joint Research
74 IPCheM Portal (europa.eu)

Centre (JRC). Proposals should also consider involving JRC with respect to the value it could
bring in providing an effective interface between the research activities and regulatory aspects
and/or to translating the research results into validated test methods and strategies fit for
regulatory purpose. In that respect, the JRC will collaborate with any successful proposal and
this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.
Applicants should be acquainted with planned activities under the European partnership for
the assessment of risks from chemicals PARC75. PARC will be informed about successful
proposals. Successful proposals will be invited to establish synergies with PARC and take
advantage of the partnership as a facilitator for open data and methodology sharing with risk
assessors and their scientific networks.

• A roadmap and a R&I agenda for international cooperation in specified areas of
exposome research and innovation, including, among others, recommendations for
exchange of knowledge and data, policy uptake, technological and conceptual
approaches and promotion of global level coordinated initiatives on the exposome are
made available to the relevant international stakeholders;

• The coordination of research initiatives, infrastructures, facilities and resources in the
area of the Exposome in Europe is supported and reinforced;
• The interoperability and harmonisation between data and studies is increased facilitating
the exchange and use of information across research disciplines and groups.
Scope: The concept of the exposome refers to the totality of environmental exposures from
conception onwards, including its external (e.g. diet, lifestyle, occupational and environmental
factors) and internal components (e.g. epigenomics, metabolomics). Developing a
comprehensive Human Exposome Project would present a fundamental shift in looking at
health, by moving research away from ‘one exposure, one disease’ understanding to a more
complex picture upon which to build solid, cost-effective preventive actions and policies. At
its most complete, the efforts could resemble in scope the Human Genome Project.
The European Human Exposome Network (EHEN)76, a cluster of 9 projects funded since
2020 for five years from Horizon 2020, is currently the world’s largest network of projects
studying the impact of environmental exposure on human health with an exposome angle.
Together, the network of projects aims to study the combination of exposures to pollutants
and other stressors, across different life stages and socio-economic conditions, via a number
of exposure vehicles such as consumption patterns, lifestyle and working and living
environment, and their collective effect on human health.
At the international level, some related activities are ongoing in, e.g., the US (National
Institute for Environmental Health Sciences) and Japan. Currently, there is only sporadic
cooperation initiatives between the ongoing research at the EU level and important research
groups outside Europe. However, in order to fulfil the promise of deciphering the human
exposome, a large-scale effort similar to the Human Genome Project could be envisaged, for
which a preparatory coordination and support action would be highly useful to identify and
discuss the research needs and specific areas of potential cooperation at the global level.
Additionally, both at the European and global level better coordination is essential to foster
new opportunities to collect, harmonise, combine and analyse large data sets emanating from
new and evolving technologies. This offers also new possibilities to understand the pathways
leading from a multitude of environmental exposures to the global health burden of common
chronic diseases. Standardisation and interoperability of data is also needed to assure access
to quality data sources at the European and global level.
On the policy side, the outcomes of advancing the exposome research can touch upon and
contribute to a better implementation of a wide range of policies and EU priorities such as the
EU Chemicals Strategy77, Zero Pollution Action Plan78, the European Green Deal79 and
climate policies80, among others. The benefits of cooperation would also extend to

international initiatives such as activities of the World Health Organization related to
environment and health81 and the United Nations activities on climate82 and environment83.
Accordingly, proposals should cover, among others, most of the following activities:
• Proposal for a common agreed conceptual framework for the exposome;
• Proposal for options for a global governance structure for a Global Human Exposome
Network taking advantage of and connecting to the existing research infrastructures and
services in the area of the Exposome at the European level;
• Agreed technologies needed to decipher the external and internal exposome, support
longitudinal studies and potential for international cooperation;
• Proposal for data mining, analysis, opportunities for harmonisation, interoperability, and
standardisation in data collection, knowledge storage and transfer, and bioinformatics
needs at the European and global level;
• Cooperation between population and patient cohorts, integrating a large number of
variables and comprehensive environmental datasets, and biobanks, also covering the
perinatal period;
• Facilitation of the regulatory uses of results including for regulatory science and risk
assessment.
Proposals should interact with existing research infrastructures, services and research projects
in the area of the exposome (namely the European Human Exposome Network but also other
related projects and actions supported through Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe) and build
on and integrate the work being developed in these initiatives. The composition of the
applicant consortia should ensure a broad and balanced geographical representation of
Member States and Associated Countries and the proposals should involve also Widening
Member States and Associated Countries. International cooperation beyond EU with
interested parties is required.

management, communication and dissemination, science-policy
link, scientific synergies).
Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 2 ‘Living and working in a health-promoting
environment’. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
• National and EU authorities apply user-friendly tools to produce and use generated data
on the impact of pollutants on health;

• National and EU authorities benefit from access to robust and transparent indicators for
health impact assessment to monitor efficacy of pollution-mitigating actions and
policies;
• Policymakers and other stakeholders, e.g. public authorities such as urban planners,
health professionals, employers, civil society organisations and citizens, use developed
guidelines to take action to prevent pollution-related illnesses and impairments, and
choose healthier lifestyles and behaviours;
• EU, national and regional authorities receive guidance and recommendations for updates
of (1) scientific evidence about health risks caused by environmental pollutants (2)
advice on management and mitigation of these health risks and (3) guidance and
recommendations for updates of limit values for different classes of pollutants in the
environment; these recommendations should take into account vulnerable population
groups and people with increased vulnerability because of pre-existing medical
conditions;
• The implementation of the Zero-Pollution Action Plan, the Chemical Strategy for
Sustainability and the EU legislation on air quality, noise and waste continue to be
supported by a strong evidence-base;
• Relevant actors in our daily lives, e.g. medical personnel, building engineers, teachers,
urban planners etc., have access to information such as training courses on pollution and
health impacts.
Scope: The European Green Deal set out by the European Commission recognises that man-
made environmental pollution is an increasing threat for human health and wellbeing. Opinion
polls87 show that climate change, air pollution, and waste are the three most important
environmental issues that European citizens are concerned about. Over three-quarters (78%)
of respondents believe that environmental issues have a direct effect on their daily life and
health.
Pollution affects a large number of people in Europe and beyond: A 2018 assessment
attributed 16% of total global mortality to pollution-related disease. Over 7 million people die
of exposure to polluted air every year worldwide88. For 2019, the European Environment
Agency has estimated that around 350 000 premature deaths in the EU can be attributed to air
pollution (namely from particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone)89. Today, more than 1
in 4 Europeans is exposed to traffic noise levels dangerous to their health in their homes,
schools and workplaces90. The increase of artificial light at night (ALAN) in cities has altered
the natural light levels in the environment and extended human activities to the usually dark
hours. It has been estimated that more than 80% of the world population is living under light

polluted skies91. Waste92 continues to be a persistent environmental issue in Europe, and it is
estimated that there are 2.5 million contaminated sites in Europe, with potentially significant
adverse health effects93.
The global burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has consistently increased over
the last decades, being now estimated to account for 70% of deaths globally (World Health
Organization). The growing burden of chronic diseases will also be a challenge for Europe’s
healthcare systems, these diseases already accounting for an estimated 70-80% of healthcare
costs. Currently, around 50 million European citizens suffer from two or more chronic
conditions and most of these people are over 65.94 The most recent WHO environmental
burden of disease estimations suggest that, annually, 13% of deaths (630 000) in the WHO
Europe region are attributable to environmental stressors and an EEA report concluded that,
90% of deaths attributable to the environment result from non-communicable diseases,
including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
mental, behavioural and neurological disorders, diabetes, kidney disease and asthma95. While
early childhood deaths have declined, the years lived with disability have increased,
particularly with chronic disease.
The proposed research should strengthen the knowledge base available to policymakers
regarding pollution-disease associations and causal mechanisms at different phases of the life
course, taking advantage of latest molecular, cellular and computational technologies to
elucidate biological pathways from exposure (including combined exposures) to disease. The
work should bring together toxicology, exposure science, public health engineering and
environmental epidemiology, and build on data from sources such as pollution-related
databases, disease registries, epidemiological studies and biobanks, environmental and human
biomonitoring data and new generated data and could consider citizen science and other
innovative approaches. All exposure routes should be considered where relevant
(oral/digestive tract, inhalation, dermal).
The focus of this topic should be on three areas where the understanding of and evidence on
causality should be strengthened to overcome the current paucity of data and respond to calls
from policymakers. The applicants should focus on at least one of the following three aspects:
• Air pollution, especially in the urban environment, taking into account existing evidence,
notably the latest WHO air quality guidelines of 2021 and their recommendations on
different pollutants96, including on pollutants of emerging concern, looking at e.g.

• Noise pollution and light pollution impact on human health;
• Pollution from hazardous waste (e.g. pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, e-waste, plastics
(including nano- and microplastics)) in heavily contaminated environments and adverse
health outcomes.
Several of the following activities should be included:
• Research activities to strengthen the evidence base for pollution-disease associations and
underlying causality mechanisms and biological pathways, taking into account combined
exposures and mechanisms of increased sensitivity in susceptible groups;
• Delivery of FAIR data97 on causal associations between environmental risk factors and
health outcomes, in particular for air pollutants of emerging concern, specifically
ultrafine particles, black carbon, and others, taking into account vulnerable population
groups and specific exposure situations in a life-course approach including vulnerable
early-stages of life and transgenerational risks;
• Development of user-friendly tools for systematic mining and assessment of the
knowledge generated and translation into best practices and to improve the assessment of
individual life-exposure to pollutants;
• Proposals for environmental limit values for the studied pollutants and generation of
health impact indicators, where relevant and taking into account existing standards and
evidence;
• Development of guidelines and socio-economic and decision support tools for different
actors including policymakers, health professionals and citizens to take action to prevent
pollution-related illnesses and impairments, and to enable the choice of healthier
lifestyles and behaviours;
• Identification of cross-sectoral interventions (case studies) with the potential for
remediating pollution and risk of exposure and improving human health and well-being
in the short/medium term;
• Development of training courses on pollution and health impacts to inform professionals
impacting our daily lives e.g. medical personnel, engineers, teachers, urban planners;
• Design of best-practice evidence-based communication actions for fact-based risk and
benefit communication and improving citizen awareness of pollution and preventive
actions, offsetting dissemination of misinformation;

• Undertaking case studies to demonstrate the added societal value of tools, methodologies
and guidelines developed and the implementation of resulting actions to decrease health
impacts of exposures.
Aspects such as gender, regional variations, socioeconomics and culture should be
considered, where appropriate. Proposals should ensure that chemical monitoring data are
shared in IPCHEM98 through involvement with the European Commission's Joint Research
Centre (JRC). In that respect, the JRC will collaborate with any successful proposal and this
collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal’s approval.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.
In order to optimise synergies and increase the impact of the projects, all projects selected for
funding from this topic will form a cluster and be required to participate in common
networking and joint activities. Without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities,
proposals should allocate a sufficient budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and
to cover the costs of any other potential common networking and joint activities.

Destination 3. Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden
Calls for proposals under this destination are directed towards the Key Strategic Orientation
KSO-D ‘Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society’ of Horizon
Europe’s Strategic Plan 2021-2024. Research and innovation supported under this destination
should contribute to the impact area ‘Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare’ and
in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health
cluster: ‘health care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious
diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare
diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding
and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability
and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety’. In addition,
research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the
following impact areas: ‘A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats’, ‘Climate change
mitigation and adaptation’, and ‘High quality digital services for all’.
Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature
death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and
economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often
dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and
neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs99. These
costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable.
Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive
measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including
emerging infectious diseases and infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat
to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some
predictions100.
To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new
preparedness and prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines,
therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing preparedness and
prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues.
This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available
worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of
investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international
cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships
and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious
diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for
99 Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic
conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those
diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of
working age with an estimated €115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).
100 AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per
year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.

global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to
strengthen patient safety.
In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the
Commission’s political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-
communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and
response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of
antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental
health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this
destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers
and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and
diseases, and better evidence-base for policymaking; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics
that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and
assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development
and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection,
treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health
technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine
approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced
therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for
those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the
public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks
and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).
In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European
Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable
cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities
such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and
adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential
synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects
funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing
projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to
European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic
challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas
cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance,
with cluster 3 “Civil security for society” such as on health security/emergencies
(preparedness and response, medical countermeasures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural
disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 “Digital, Industry and
Space” such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of
disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 “Food, bioeconomy, natural resources,
agriculture and environment” such as on health security and AMR (one-health:
human/animal/plant/soil/water health). In addition, while focusing on civilian applications,
there may be there may be synergies with actions conducted under the European Defence
Fund, notably in the field of defence medical countermeasures.

Health
Based on needs that emerged during the management of COVID-19, some research and
innovation actions under Destination 3 should support the mission of the European Health
Emergency and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen Europe’s ability to prevent, detect,
and rapidly respond to cross-border health emergencies by ensuring the availability and
access to key medical countermeasures. Other actions should deliver relevant complementary
inputs to the “Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan”101 in order to cover the entire cancer care
pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring,
as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and
complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the
EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)102. These synergies and complementarities could be
achieved, notably through mechanisms based on feedback loops, enabling on the one hand to
identify policy needs that should be prioritised in research and innovation actions and
facilitating on the other hand the implementation of research results into policy actions and
clinical practice, thereby providing an integrated response across sectors and policy fields.
Expected impacts:
Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to
tackling diseases and reducing disease burden, and more specifically to several of the
following impacts:
• Health burden of diseases in the EU and worldwide is reduced through effective disease
management, including through the development and integration of innovative
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, personalised medicine approaches, digital and
other people-centred solutions for health care. In particular, patients are diagnosed early
and accurately and receive effective, cost-efficient and affordable treatment, including
patients with a rare disease, due to effective translation of research results into new
diagnostic tools and therapies.
• Premature mortality from non-communicable diseases is reduced by one third (by 2030),
mental health and well-being is promoted, and the voluntary targets of the WHO Global
Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 are attained (by 2025),
with an immediate impact on the related disease burden (DALYs)103,104, 105.
• Health care systems benefit from strengthened research and innovation expertise, human
capacities and know-how for combatting communicable and non-communicable

reduction in the overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory
diseases; Halt the rise in diabetes and obesity; An 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies
and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major non-communicable diseases in both
public and private facilities.
105 Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a quantitative indicator of overall disease burden, expressed as
the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.

diseases, including through international cooperation. In particular, they are better
prepared to respond rapidly and effectively to health emergencies and are able to prevent
and manage communicable diseases transmissions epidemics, including within
healthcare settings.
• Citizens benefit from reduced (cross-border) health threat of epidemics and AMR
pathogens, in the EU and worldwide106, 107.
• Patients and citizens are knowledgeable of disease threats, involved and empowered to
make and shape decisions for their health, and better adhere to knowledge-based disease
management strategies and policies (especially for controlling outbreaks and
emergencies).
The EU benefits from high visibility, leadership and standing in international fora on global
health and global health security.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
• Reduced health-related suffering and improved well-being and quality of life of patients
in need of palliative and end-of-life care and their professional and family caregivers.
• Patients have early and better access to palliative or end-of-life care services of higher
quality and (cost) effectiveness.
• Patients and their professional and family caregivers are able to engage meaningfully
with the improved evidence-based and information-driven palliative care joint decision-
making process.
• Health care providers and health policymakers have access to and use the improved
clinical guidelines and policy with respect to pain and/or other symptoms management,
psychological and/or spiritual support, and palliative or end-of-life care for patients.
• Reduced societal, healthcare and economic burden associated with increasing demands
of palliative or end-of-life care services that is beneficial for citizens and preserves
sustainability of the health care systems.
Scope: The complexity of health conditions related to life-threatening and chronic diseases,
acute and chronic pain, late or long-term side effects as consequences of diseases and also
their treatments affect quality of life of patients and their families and pose an immense
societal and economic burden. Palliative118 and end-of-life care approaches improve quality of
life of patients and professional and family caregivers through the prevention and relief of
suffering by means of early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other factors
such as physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems. Although a variety of interventions are
in use, they are often not adequately validated or adapted to the specific needs of patients
affected by complex diseases or their co- or multimorbidities. Therefore, a need exists to
strengthen the evidence base for available patient-centred effective interventions improving
quality of life and outcomes of patients of all ages in the domains of palliative and end-of-life
care.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:
118 https://www.who.int/cancer/palliative/definition/en/

Health
• Demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of newly proposed or specifically
adapted pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological interventions to improve well-
being and quality of life of patients suffering from life-threatening and chronic
diseases119 (including disabilities). Whenever relevant, serious late and long-term side
effects of disease treatments or symptoms that occur at the end of life of patients should
be considered. The legal and ethical aspects of the proposed interventions should be
taken into consideration and be fully addressed.
• Prove the feasibility of integrating the proposed interventions in current pain
management, palliative and/or end-of-life care regimes and healthcare systems across
Europe. The complex human, social, cultural and ethical aspects that are necessarily
managed by those care regimes and healthcare systems should be reflected from
patients’ as well as those of their professional and family caregivers’ perspectives. The
views and values of patients and their caregivers (including families, volunteers, nurses
and others) should also be appropriately taken into account in patient-centred care
decisions.
• Identify and analyse relationships between sex, gender, age, disabilities and socio-
economic factors in health and any other relevant factors (e.g. ethical, familial, cultural
considerations, including personal beliefs and religious perspectives, etc.) that could
affect health equity120 to the proposed interventions, including equitable access.
• Analyse the barriers and opportunities to re-invigorating and enhancing timely social
inclusion and active engagement of patients in need of palliative and end-of-life care and
their caregivers.
• Provide implementation strategies and guidelines of patient-centred communication for
health and social care professionals as well as standards for evidenced based
communication trainings for caregivers, considering the potential of social innovation
approaches or tools.
• When relevant, provide policy recommendations for pain management, psychological
and/or spiritual support, and palliative or end-of-life care of patients.
Randomised clinical trials and observational studies, targeting different age groups, should be
considered for this topic. Proposals should give a sound feasibility assessment, provide details
of the methodology, including an appropriate patient selection and realistic recruitment plans,
justified by available publications and/or preliminary results.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the

societal impact of the related research activities. Proposals should consider a patient-centred
approach that empowers patients, increase health literacy in palliative and end of life care,
promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between health professionals, patients and their
families, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and
joint activities, including internationally, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities
could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge,
the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could
also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and
pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are
expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider
covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail
concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during
the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of
facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:
• Health care practitioners and providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
and/or those in high-income countries (HICs) serving vulnerable populations have access
to and use specific guidelines to implement health interventions that decrease risk factors
of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) associated with city121 environments.
• Public health managers and authorities have access to improved insights and evidence on
the NCDs caused or impacted by city environments and which factors influence the
implementation of preventive actions that address risk behaviours in concerned city
populations. They use this knowledge to design improved city planning policies to
diminish health associated risks.
• Adopting an implementation science approach to studying interventions in different city
contexts, researchers, clinicians and authorities have an improved understanding how
specific interventions can be better adapted to different city environments and how the
interventions could be scaled within and across cities taking into account specific social,
political, economic and cultural contexts.
• Public health managers and authorities use evidence-based strategies and tools for
promoting population health in equitable and environmentally sustainable ways,
enabling cities to better address the challenges of rapid urbanisation, growing social
inequalities, and climate change.
• Communities, local stakeholders and authorities are fully engaged in implementing and
taking up individual and/or structural level interventions and thus contribute to deliver
better health.
Scope: The European Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases
(GACD)122. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members and aligned
with the 8th GACD call.
The topic is focused on implementation research with the potential to reduce the risks of
NCDs in cities in LMICs and/or vulnerable populations in HICs. Proposals should focus on
implementation science around evidence-based interventions that promote healthy behaviours,
121 Non-rural settings; a densely populated urban or peri-urban environment. Cities may also include
informal settlements and slums surrounding city centres. Applicants can justify why a particular context
may be considered a city.

and that have the potential to profoundly reduce the risk of chronic diseases and multi-
morbidity.
Non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases,
respiratory diseases, certain cancers, and mental health disorders, are the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in both LMICs and HICs123. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought
these chronic diseases further into the spotlight, as the majority of those who have
experienced severe illness and/or death have had one or more underlying NCD. Reducing the
burden of NCDs is therefore critical to building more resilient, equitable, and healthier
societies.
Air, water, and soil pollution; lack of greenspace; urban heat islands; lack of safe
infrastructure for walking, cycling, and active living; and wide availability of tobacco,
alcohol, and unhealthy foods and beverages drive the NCD epidemic in city environments124.
More than half of the world’s population currently live in cities and this number is projected
to rise to 68% by 2050. There is an urgent need to equip local authorities and policymakers
with strategies for maximising the health-promoting potential of cities, while minimising or
reversing environmental degradation and health inequities.
Cities provide tremendous social, cultural, and economic opportunity, and have the potential
to become engines of good health and support climate change adaptation125. Innovative
health-focused programmes, policies, and infrastructure, such as public smoking bans,
bikeable streets, greenspace, and vehicle emission laws, can shape the behaviours of millions
of people and decrease exposure to environmental contaminants. Applicants to the current call
are invited to conduct implementation research that leads to improved understanding of how
specific interventions can be better adapted to different city environments and/or scaled
within and across cities, taking into account unique local social, political, economic, and
cultural contexts.
The proposed implementation research must be focus on addressing NCD risk factors
associated with city environments and related health inequities. In all cases, the selected study
population(s) must live in cities, which may include informal settlements near urban centres,
peri-urban environments, and city centres. The study population may include people with
existing NCDs, those without existing NCDs, or a combination of both. Applicants are
encouraged to take a life course approach, adapting the intervention to one or more key life
stage(s) critical for reducing lifelong NCD risk.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:
• Select one or more city/ies in which the research will be conducted. Applicants must
justify why a particular context is considered a city.

• Select one or more evidence-based interventions known to reduce NCD risk factor(s)
associated with city environments. Applicants should justify the choice of intervention(s)
and provide evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and
potential for long-term health and other impacts. Applicants may also wish to consider
implementation research focusing on the WHO Best Buys, though this is not a
requirement.
• Adapt these intervention(s) for selected study population(s) based in one or more
city/ies, taking into account the unique social, political, economic, and cultural
context(s). Applicants should justify why these adaptations will not compromise the
known effectiveness of the selected intervention(s).
• Provide a research plan for investigating how to promote the uptake and/or scale-up of
the intervention(s) in the selected study population(s), using validated implementation
research frameworks.
• Specifically address issues of equitable implementation to ensure interventions reach the
populations that need them the most.
• Have an appropriate strategy for measuring both implementation research outcomes and
real-world effectiveness outcomes and indicators (related to NCD prevention and, if
feasible, planetary health and/or non-health sectors).
• Demonstrate a commitment to stakeholder engagement.
• Demonstrate a commitment to planetary health in that the proposed intervention,
implementation strategies and research practices minimise the consortium’s ecological
footprint.
• Provide a sustainability plan or describe a pathway to sustain the proposed intervention
after the funding ends.
The proposed interventions of focus may fall under one or both of the following themes:
Theme 1: Behavioural change interventions
These interventions comprise of innovative approaches to helping people live in cities
maintain good physical and mental health despite infrastructural, environmental, climate, and
social challenges. Behavioural interventions might include, but are not limited to,
programmes and policies that target alcohol and tobacco use, sleep, exercise promotion,
healthful nutrition (e.g. in school canteens), addressing the psychosocial impacts of climate
change and climate change related disasters, and reducing exposure to environmental
contaminants.
Part 4 - Page 71 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
Theme 2: Interventions that focus on modifying the built environment126
These interventions focus on modifying the built environment to improve its health-promoting
potential127. Proposals should aim to inform urban design such that it reduces NCD risks; for
example, by improving a city’s walk- or bike-ability, increasing green space to reduce the
health impacts of air pollution or extreme heat, reducing environmental toxins, addressing
homelessness or unsafe housing, improving accessibility of healthy foods, decreasing
widespread advertising for tobacco and alcohol, or reducing noise and air pollution from road
traffic. For proposals that focus on modifying the built environment, applicants should
demonstrate that the intervention will be able to withstand expected impacts from climate
and/or improve resilience to the health impacts of climate change in city environments.
Applicants should be able to show that the city government or community-based organisation
that they partner with has a dedicated budget for the construction, maintenance, and/or scale
up of the proposed intervention(s), especially for large infrastructure projects. Applicants
should also be able to show that the timelines of the research and construction of
infrastructure projects will align such that it will be possible to answer the proposed
implementation research questions over the proposed duration, and such that the research
results will be available in time to inform stakeholder decisions about how the project is
implemented, improved, and/or scaled up.
Proposals should include a plan on how to measure implementation research outcomes and
the intervention’s real-world efficacy in preventing NCDs. In case health outcomes might not
be apparent over the duration of the study period, and applicants may therefore instead
include plans to measure the intervention’s impact on upstream health indicators, such as
those related to the social determinants of health, or to measure other proxy health outcomes.
Where feasible and relevant, applicants should also describe a plan for evaluating the
planetary health and/or climate impacts of an intervention’s implementation. Applicants are
also encouraged to develop a plan for measuring outcomes or indicators relevant to non-health
or environmental impacts, especially when working on projects with multi-sectoral themes
(for example, themes that cut across health and transportation, social services, waste
management, etc.).
Projects should consider the structural and social determinants of health and discuss their
potential impact on the effective implementation of the intervention(s) in city environments.
Of interest is also the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities128.
Projects should be gender-responsive and consider socioeconomic, racial or other factors that
relate to equitable impacts of the intervention or barriers to equitable implementation. The
aim should be to adapt and scale-up the implementation of these intervention(s) in accessible
126 The man-made components of the environment, such as building, traffic, sewage, parks, and other
infrastructure.
127 Proposals are intended for research that helps guide the implementation and/or scale up of the proposed
intervention. Therefore, the execution of infrastructural interventions (e.g., constructing bike lanes or
housing, etc.) is not in the scope of this topic.

and equitable ways in order to prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases in real-life
settings. Poverty, racism, ethnic discrimination, physical and mental ableism, ageism, and
other inequities are directly associated with reduced potential for health promotion and
disease prevention. If there is a focus on a particular population in this context, then the
reason for this should be justified.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.
Proposals should present a strategy to include the relevant policymakers, local authorities, as
well as other stakeholders such as community groups, or other individuals or organisations
involved in the implementation of the intervention, from the development to the
implementation knowledge translation phase.
Applicants are encouraged to propose activities to increase research capacity and capability in
the field of implementation research among researchers, health professionals, and public
health leaders through skill building, knowledge sharing, and networking. In this regard, they
may propose plans for capacity building within their proposal, especially, but not exclusively,
for early career researchers and for members from lower resourced environments, such as
LMICs or indigenous communities.

(Implementation). The cumulative threshold will be 12.
Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
• The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge on viruses with
epidemic potential and in particular a better understanding of different potential
mechanisms of action for the development of broad-spectrum anti-viral therapeutics for
these viruses.
• The scientific and clinical communities have access to novel approaches for the
development of anti-viral therapies for emerging and re-emerging infections in the
context of epidemic and pandemic preparedness.
• The scientific and clinical communities have access to experimental broad-spectrum
anti-viral candidates against emerging or re-emerging viral infections for further clinical
investigation.
• A diverse and robust pipeline of broad-spectrum anti-viral drug candidates is available
for emerging and re-emerging viral infections, increasing therapeutic options for clinical
deployment in case of an epidemic or pandemic.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases remain a major threat to
health and health security in the EU and globally. Viral disease emergence is expected to
accelerate due to among other, climate change, and thus a proactive approach to the
development of anti-viral therapeutics in preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks
is needed. The availability of broad-spectrum anti-viral therapies would provide a critical
preparedness measure against future health threats, due to infectious disease epidemics or
pandemics.
Proposals should develop and advance broad-spectrum anti-viral compounds and develop
novel approaches to the development of such compounds, which target viruses with high
epidemic or pandemic potential for the EU, such as those included in the list of priority
diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO)129, with particular attention to those
meeting the criteria identified by the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority
(HERA)130.

Health
Proposals should cover viruses for which there are no currently available effective
therapeutics or for which the therapeutics available are sub-optimal, and are expected to
incorporate state-of-the-art screening technology and innovative approaches to identify new
targets for antiviral compound development. Emphasis should be put on the research and
development of broad-spectrum antivirals, which may include repurposing of previously
approved or in-pipeline drugs. Proposals could also include elucidation of mode-of-action for
candidate anti-viral therapeutics.
Proposals should aim to diversify and accelerate the global therapeutic research and
development pipeline for emerging and re-emerging viral infections, and to strengthen the
current leading role of the EU in therapeutic research and development.
Proposals should address all of the following areas:
• Preclinical work and proof-of-concept/first-in-human studies and early safety and
efficacy trials for testing new or improved anti-viral therapeutics, with a clear regulatory
and clinical pathway. Phase IIb/III phase trials will not be supported.
• Innovative delivery systems and suitable safety profiles for broad use should be
considered when possible. Attention should be paid to critical social factors such as sex,
gender, age, socio-economic factors, ethnicity/migration, and disability.
• Application of novel approaches and widely applicable workflows (e.g. artificial
intelligence) for rapid and reliable identification of broad-spectrum anti-viral
therapeutics.
Applicants are expected to engage with regulatory bodies in a timely manner to ensure
adequacy of the actions from a regulatory point of view.

to relevant other regional and global initiatives.
Scope: The COVID-19 pandemic research response has illustrated the importance of clinical
research preparedness, as well as the benefit gained from the coordination between European
clinical research initiatives. Two key pillars of such clinical research in pandemic
preparedness and response are the clinical (interventional) trials and the cohort (observational)
studies.
The large-scale European COVID-19 clinical trials have been gathered under a network for
COVID-19 therapeutic trials131 and a network for COVID-19 vaccine trials132 and strong
common coordination mechanisms between the trials have been established. The recently
launched Ecraid133 is a European clinical research network that has been in development since

before the COVID-19 pandemic. The EU-funded projects conducting cohort research in
Europe and globally have also come together to establish stronger coordination between them.
This topic aims at maintaining and strengthening existing strategic coordination mechanisms
across adaptive platform trials and across cohort studies in Europe and beyond for avoiding
redundancies, promoting complementarities and facilitating cooperation among EU-funded
clinical research for infectious diseases. Proposals should strengthen the leading role of the
EU in clinical research preparedness for future epidemics and pandemics, through ensuring
coordination of the European adaptive platform trials and of the European cohort studies. The
coordination mechanisms support the longer-term perspective of preparedness for future
infectious disease epidemics and pandemics, where the networks enable the conduct of
perpetual platform trials and of perpetual strategic cohorts with the in-built agility to pivot to
emerging diseases when an epidemic strikes.
Proposals should describe a coordination mechanism for adaptive platform trials and/or for
cohort research. The coordination mechanism builds on existing coordination efforts for these
networks, providing strategic support and vision for the perpetual trials and cohort studies
belonging to the networks in the context of pandemic preparedness. Within the adaptive
platform trial network, the coordination mechanism supports reflections e.g. on the diversity
of the trial target populations (e.g. primary care or hospitalised patients) or on different
possible medical countermeasures (e.g. therapeutics, vaccines), etc. Within the cohort
network, the coordination mechanism supports reflections e.g. on diversity in type of cohorts
and research questions to be addressed, or on harmonised approaches to data collection and
analysis, etc.
Proposals should address proper connections with relevant European initiatives and
organisations, such as the European Pandemic Preparedness Partnership, the European Health
Preparedness and Emergency Response Authority (HERA), as well as the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(ECDC). Synergies with successful proposals under the HORIZON-INFRA-2023-DEV-01-01
topic should be sought, and collaboration with other relevant research infrastructures should
be envisaged. Proposals should also be open to engage with global initiatives such as the
Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R)134, the Global
Health EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking135, or the World Health Organization (WHO).
Proposals should address the following areas:
• Fostering a trusted and proactive environment within the coordination mechanism that
supports the timely exchange of research results, allows for discussion on challenges
encountered in their research and finding solutions together to ensure cooperation and
synergy within each network;

• Developing a common approach for the European clinical research to enable pragmatic
solutions to shared challenges across European clinical trials and/or cohorts for
pandemic preparedness and response, guaranteeing the best interest of European trial or
study patients or volunteers;
• Promoting an optimal use of resources, based on a sound scientific approach and
maximising the value added for the generation of scientific evidence, through a common
baseline approach towards protocol development, harmonised and FAIR data 136
collection and analysis leveraging existing initiatives;
• Involving relevant European stakeholders, such as representatives from regulatory
authorities, industry, policymakers, patient organisations, etc., as well as relevant non-
European networks and stakeholders;
• Promoting the visibility and attractiveness of European adaptive platform trials and/or
cohorts for clinical investigators in Europe and beyond ; as well as active
communication with the science community, patient advocacy groups and other
stakeholders, to develop trust, and also promote innovative approaches;
• Partners within the coordination mechanism should develop a plan to ensure its
sustainability. Coordination with the European Pandemic Preparedness Partnership and
the European Health Preparedness and Emergency Response Authority (HERA) is
expected.

efforts. The aim is to structure brain health research in Europe and pave the way for a
possible future partnership.
• Develop a strategic research and innovation agenda, taking into account the efforts
already undertaken by EU-supported actions141. The strategic research and innovation
agenda will identify a number of measurable, scientific-technological priorities and
socio-economic objectives, supported by an appropriate analysis.
• Develop plans for a governance structure of a future partnership, as well as
implementation modalities with long-term sustainability in mind, and under the
leadership of an EU Member State or Associated Country.
• Ensure a broad geographical representation of European countries and plan for inclusion
of all main related research initiatives, as well as key organisations and associations. In
this way, the coordination action should reflect the ‘umbrella’ role of a future initiative
that will structure brain health research in Europe, and make it more impactful.
• Consider international initiatives by engaging with global organisations142, as well as
with global initiatives and research organisations143 in the field.
• Elaborate on platforms and tools for use by the research community, including on how
they can best complement, integrate with each other. In this context, infrastructures
already developed at the European144 or national level that enable sharing of samples,
quality data and advanced analytical tools should be included in the analysis. Reflections
should also be made on how the future initiative can contribute to the development of the
European Health Data Space.
This coordination action implies the preparation and organisation of meetings, as well as
support to information exchange with relevant stakeholder groups and with the public.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to the following expected outcomes:
• All players along the health care value chain are provided with new knowledge for a
better understanding of the links (e.g. causalities) between infectious diseases (IDs) and
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and comorbidities, including knowledge on host
risk factors that impact the development of disease progression for NCDs and/or IDs.
• Researchers and clinicians are provided with a robust evidence base that will contribute
to the development of new or improved tools to diagnose and prevent the development
and aggravation of non-communicable disease(s) as well as early treatment and
management of patients suffering from co-morbidities following an infectious disease.
• Healthcare practitioners have access to knowledge to guide them on preventive
measures, on early identification of diseases onset and of those patients at risk of
developing severe disease progression, and on the optimal treatment of patients.
When NCDs are related to infectious diseases with pandemic potential, healthcare
practitioners will be provided with new evidence to help them make informed decision on the
management of the diseases in the future. Public health authorities will be better prepared to

Health
issue targeted recommendations linked or not to the use of specific medical countermeasures
in crisis times.
Scope: Increasing evidence suggests that several infections might influence the development
of many non-communicable diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer, post-covid-19
condition145), or that NCD may be influenced by concurrent presence in the same individual
of one (or more) infections. On the other hand, NCDs might represent risk factors for IDs.
The proposals are expected to elucidate and provide a better understanding of causative links
between infections and non-communicable diseases onsets, and/or the impact of infections on
the exacerbation of existing NCDs or vice versa, in children and/or adults. The analysis of
genetics, immune status, immune or inflammatory responses, microbiome, lifestyle and/or
other relevant factors (e.g. differences in age, sex/gender, vaccination status, ethnicity) should
be integrated to get information for prevention, early diagnosis, risk factors, and to better
understand causative links as well as the progression of those non-communicable diseases.
In determining the connection between one or multiple concomitant infection(s) and the
development of non-communicable disease(s), the proposals might address any infection
including those with pandemic potential (viral, bacterial, or fungal) with non-communicable
diseases of major importance. Research on cancer is excluded as it will be covered by the
Mission on Cancer.
Special attention should be given to vulnerable individuals, such as those with known existing
preconditions.
Preclinical research, observational studies and/or clinical studies can be considered for this
topic. Proposals could include patient follow-up to identify conditions that may appear only
after a patient has recovered from the infectious disease. Those proposals including clinical
evaluation should give a sound feasibility assessment, provide details of the methodology,
including an appropriate patient selection and realistic recruitment plans, justified by available
publications and/or preliminary results.
The applicants are encouraged to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) tools that enable
advanced quality data analysis and for assessing and predicting the risk of developing a
disease and/or the risk of disease progression/severity where relevant.
Projects funded under this topic that focus on COVID-19 and post COVID-19 condition (also
known as long-COVID) are strongly encouraged to collaborate and build links with (one of)
the relevant EU-funded projects, such as ORCHESTRA146. They should also pay special
attention and link to the newly established European COVID-19 data sharing platform147.

to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
• The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge of vaccine-induced
immunity and, in particular, a better understanding of factors that affect the magnitude,
breadth, nature and duration of immunity to vaccine antigens.
• The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge of the durability
and breadth of vaccine-induced immunity in vulnerable populations and older age
groups.
Part 4 - Page 83 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge of correlates of
protection for pathogens with epidemic potential to allow the development of effective
vaccines.
• The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge of the
characteristics that influence vaccine effectiveness to allow for novel approaches for the
development of vaccines for emerging and re-emerging infections, including antigenic
variants, in the context of epidemic and pandemic preparedness.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are a critical component needed to
bring infectious disease pandemics under control. The availability of effective vaccines that
are able to induce a strong and durable immune response are critical to respond to health
threats caused by infectious disease epidemics or pandemics. A proactive approach to
understanding the factors that affect vaccine durability and strength is necessary to ensure
development of effective vaccines for future infectious disease outbreaks.
Proposals should study vaccine-induced immunity in the general population and vulnerable
groups. Proposals should look both at the magnitude and breadth of initial immune responses
and the duration of immunity after vaccination with different vaccine types (mRNA, vector,
inactivated, subunit, attenuated,…). Proposals should assess how sex (e.g. male vs female,
pre- vs postmenopausal), age (childhood vs adolescent vs elderly) and/or lifestyle (e.g.
obesity, drug addiction, diet, sport) affect the immune response. Proposals may also examine
genetic and other molecular factors that may influence immune response in humans.
Proposals should pursue a multi-omics approach in order to foster a deep understanding of
vaccine induced immunity.
Proposals should identify correlates of protection that can be used to develop vaccines against
viruses meeting the criteria for pathogens with high pandemic potential as identified by
HERA148.
Proposals should also assess how pre-existing conditions or chronic infections influence the
immune response.
Proposals should aim to improve the global vaccine research and development pipeline for
emerging and re-emerging viral infections, and to strengthen the current leading role of the
EU in vaccine development, and therefore contributing to the work of the European Health
Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.

• The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge on viruses with
epidemic and pandemic potential and in particular a better understanding of viral targets
for vaccine development.
• The scientific and clinical communities have access to novel approaches for the
prevention and treatment for emerging and re-emerging infections in the context of
epidemic and pandemic preparedness.
• The scientific and clinical communities have access to experimental vaccine candidates
against emerging or re-emerging viral infections for further clinical investigation.
Part 4 - Page 85 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• A diverse and robust pipeline of vaccine candidates is available for emerging and re-
emerging viral infections, increasing therapeutic options for clinical deployment in case
of an epidemic or pandemic.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases remain a major threat to
health and health security in the EU and globally. Viral disease emergence is expected to
accelerate due to among other factors, climate change, and thus a proactive approach to the
development of vaccines and inhibitors for the cellular uptake of viruses in preparedness for
future infectious disease outbreaks is needed. The availability of vaccines against pathogens
with high pandemic potential meeting the criteria identified by the Health Emergency
Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA)149 would provide a critical preparedness
measure against future health threats.
Proposals should identify targets for optimal vaccine design for those pathogens where
information on host-pathogen interaction and viral surface structures is already available.
These surface structures may require further characterisation. It is necessary to determine the
extent of genetic variation with a view to develop vaccines with variant efficacy. In addition,
it is necessary to develop animal and alternative models for the testing of vaccine candidates
and for the kinetics, strength, breadth and persistence of the immune response. Proposals
should focus on the following viruses: Hendra and Nipah Virus, Lassa virus, Crimean Congo
haemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Ebola and Marburg virus, Dengue virus,
Yellow Fever virus, Zika virus, West Nile fever virus and Chikungunya virus.
Proposals should provide innovative approaches with the aim to diversify and accelerate the
global pandemic preparedness research and development pipeline for emerging and re-
emerging viral infections, and to strengthen the role of the EU in therapeutic research and
development, and therefore contributing to the work of the European Health Emergency
Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).
Proposals should address several of the following areas:
• Identification of key antigenic targets for the priority pathogens as mentioned above.
• Improvement or, if necessary, establishment of animal models for the testing of vaccine
candidates where alternative models are not available.
• Characterisation of the immunogenicity of antigenic targets in appropriate animal or
alternative models and in pre-clinical tests.
• Inclusion, if possible, of proof-of-concept studies in humans of the vaccine candidate.
Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical
studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. See

to be granted to each third party is EUR 10.00 million.
The funding rate is 50% of the eligible costs. This is justified by the
pooling of proposers' in-kind contributions and in-house activities and
by the nature of activities to be performed: in addition of joint calls,
highly integrative activities (EU clinical trial preparedness, training,
patients’ empowerment activities etc.) contributing to enhance the rare
disease research and innovation ecosystem in Europe and beyond.
Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”.
To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed,
tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
• The EU is reinforced as an internationally recognised driver of research and innovation
in rare diseases (RD) and thereby substantially contributing to the achievement of the
Sustainable Development Goals related to rare diseases;
• Research funders align, adopt and implement their RD research policies allowing for the
optimal generation and translation of knowledge into meaningful health products and
interventions responding to the needs of people living with a rare disease across Europe
and globally.
• The RD research community at large benefit from and use an improved comprehensive
knowledge framework integrating the EU, national/regional data and information
infrastructures to improve translational research.
• People living with a rare disease benefit from a more timely, equitable access to
innovative, sustainable and high-quality healthcare, taking stock of highly integrated
research and healthcare systems.
• Researchers, innovators - as well as people living with a rare disease and their advocates
(as co-creators) - effectively constitute and operate into an integrated research and
innovation ecosystem to deliver cost-effective diagnosis and treatments.
• Public and private actors, including civil society (e.g. NGOs, charities), establish
coordinated and efficient multi-stakeholder collaborations at EU and national (including
regional) levels, allowing for more effective clinical research, for example aiming at
improved success rates of therapeutic development.
Scope: The Partnership should contribute to priorities of the “Communication on effective,
accessible and resilient health systems” (COM(2014) 215 final), the “Communication on
enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market;
empowering citizens and building a healthier society” (COM(2018) 233 final) and support the
Part 4 - Page 89 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
objectives of the new EU4Health Programme (COM(2020) 405 final, Regulation (EU)
2021/522152).
This partnership should also contribute to achieving the objectives of the Pharmaceutical
Strategy for Europe153, in terms of fulfilling unmet medical needs (e.g. for rare diseases with
so called “orphan medicinal products”154) and ensuring that the benefits of innovation reach
patients in the EU.
Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health
authorities, healthcare institutions, innovators, policymakers), the Partnership will create a
critical mass of resources and to implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation
Agenda (SRIA).
The co-funded European Partnership on rare diseases should be implemented based on the
priorities identified in the SRIA and through a joint programme of activities ranging from
coordinating and funding transnational research to highly integrative and community-driven
‘in-house’ activities such as innovation strategies for the efficient exploitation of research
results, EU clinical trial preparedness activities, optimisation of research infrastructures and
resources, including networking, training and dissemination activities. It should be structured
along the following main objectives:
• Launch joint transnational calls for RD research and innovation priorities as defined in
the SRIA, resulting in financial support to third parties, based on the annual work plans;
• Develop a European Clinical Research Network to accelerate the clinical trial readiness
of the RD research community in Europe, to improve the research and innovation
potential of RD stakeholders and facilitate the cost-effective clinical development of new

Health
The Partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to
Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wishing to join. The Partnership
should include or engage with the following actors:
• Ministries in charge of R&I policy, as well as national and regional R&I and technology
funding agencies and foundations;
• Ministries in charge of health and care policy, as well as national and regional healthcare
authorities, organisations and providers (including providers members of the European
Reference Networks);
• Research infrastructures;
• Patients organisations;
• Industry;
• Charities.
The Partnership may also encourage engagement with other relevant Ministries and research
funders. It should involve other key actors from civil society and end-users, research and
innovation community, innovation owners, health and care systems owners/organisers and
health and care agencies.
The Partnership’s governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective
management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and
uptake of the results. Importantly, the EU Member States, as public funders should have a
leading role in the governance and strategic steering of the whole Partnership, including in the
co-design and the strategic orientations of the ‘in-house’ activities, such as consolidating the
research & innovation ecosystem, clinical trial preparedness for the community, contribution
to ERA, training activities etc.). Moreover, the management structure should allow the
coordinated input of key stakeholders, including but not limited to the research and innovation
community, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, formal and informal care
organisations, and innovation owners.
To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and
investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with
other Horizon Europe partnerships (institutionalised and co-funded) and missions as set out in
the working document on ‘Coherence and Synergies of candidate European Partnerships
under Horizon Europe’156 as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at
EU and international level. The proposal should also consider synergies with EU
programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health, the Digital Europe Programme
(DIGITAL), the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the European Regional Development

Fund (ERDF)157, InvestEU, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and the Technical
Support Instrument (TSI).
Cooperation with international organisations, and non-European institutions and experts may
be considered. Participation of third countries is encouraged. Their commitments to the
Partnership would not be eligible for the calculation of EU funding. Applicants should
describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to
achieve with this kind of collaboration.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or
regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational
proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to
third parties is one of the activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives.
Collaboration with the EU agency involved in authorising orphan medicinal products, the
European Medicines Agency (EMA), should be considered to enhance the sharing of
knowledge and data regarding orphan medicinal products and rare diseases, while national
agencies producing knowledge on orphan medicinal products and rare diseases may also join
the Partnership, e.g. as beneficiaries.
When defining calls for proposals, this Partnership needs to consider the effective
contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH
experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce
meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research
activities.
Collaboration with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) must be
considered to materialise the sharing of (meta)data regarding registries for rare diseases,
exchanging data for clinical studies and research based on a unified pseudonymisation tool
provided by the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform) and
related tools and services, as well as in other areas of mutual interest, such as training and
capacity building.
The total indicative budget for the partnership is up to EUR 150 million and subject to the
effective implementation of the commitments made by the members of the consortium. The
Commission envisages to include new actions in its future work programmes to provide
continued support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.
The expected duration of the partnership is seven to ten years.

Community (2021-2025). 160.
Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:
• Health policymakers are aware of the healthcare interventions (pharmacological, non-
pharmacological or technological interventions; including preventive and rehabilitative
actions) that are identified as working best for the specific population groups from the
point of view of safety, efficacy, patient outcomes, adherence, quality of life,
accessibility, and (cost-) effectiveness.
• Health professionals have access to and use the improved clinical guidelines on the
optimal treatment of patients and prevention of diseases e.g. through vaccines.
Considerations made in the guidelines include the harmonisation and standardisation of
care for high burden diseases or conditions throughout Europe, as well as possible
individualised needs of patients.
• The scientific and clinical communities make effective use of state-of-the-art
information, data, technologies, tools and best practices to develop interventions that are
sustainable.
• Citizens, patients, prescribers, and payers receive more accurate information on available
healthcare interventions via ad hoc communication platforms.

Health
• The scientific and clinical communities make wide use of the newly established open
access databases and/or integrate them with existing open access infrastructures for
storage and sharing of collected data according to FAIR161 principles.
Scope: Effective, affordable and accessible healthcare for diverse population groups is
challenging and complex. For example, specific needs underlie the delivery of effective
preventive actions and therapeutic treatments to a rapidly growing elderly population, often
presenting comorbidities and associated polypharmacy. The paediatric population, including
children born preterm, has also its specific needs in specially adjusted therapeutics and early
interventions to address emerging health and developmental problems. Similar to the elderly
population, the paediatric population is often excluded from many clinical trials that generate
the evidence base for healthcare interventions. Women, including pregnant women, are also
often under-represented in clinical studies and access to quality healthcare is frequently
inadequate. Other population groups with limited access to quality healthcare and/or under-
representation in clinical studies include low-income groups, and refugees. Intersectionality
within these groups also needs consideration.
Proposals should address most of the following:
• Compare the use of currently existing (pharmacological, non-pharmacological and
technological) healthcare interventions in specific population groups (or selected
subgroups). While there is no restriction on diseases or conditions, preference will be
given to proposals focusing on interventions with high public health relevance162.
• Ensure acceptability and sustainability of the healthcare intervention through early
involvement of ‘end users’ (e.g. patients, care providers) in the design of the study
(integrating patient valued outcomes) and, where possible, in the research process
including implementation. Additionally, proposals should take into account the diversity
of health systems in different regions of Europe to allow large-scale uptake.
• Consider involving HTA bodies in order to create synergies and accelerate the practical
implementation of the results. Where relevant, existing work of EU-funded projects such
as EUnetHTA163 should be also taken into account.
• Consider issues of particular relevance for the target populations, for example,
multimorbidity, complex chronic conditions, polypharmacy, substance misuse, vaccine
efficacy, compliance, age, gender specificities and diseases with high societal burden
(including but not limited to e.g. musculoskeletal diseases and mental health disorders).
Special consideration should be given to fulfilling all ethical requirements.
• For the chosen population, assess clinical and safety parameters, as well as health and
socio-economic outcomes (e.g. quality of life, patient mortality, (co)morbidity, costs,
161 See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this work programme part.
162 Interventions addressing diseases or conditions that are particularly frequent, have a high negative
impact on the quality of life of the individual and/or are associated with significant costs where savings
can be achieved.

and performance of the health system). Agreed core outcome sets (COS) should be used
as endpoints in conditions where they already exist, in other cases, efforts should be
made to agree on such COS. Consider using new instruments and methods for
determining the burden of disease and for evaluating the effects of the interventions.
Low-cost innovations should also be considered.
• Inclusion of patient organisations and associations of caregivers and other healthcare
professionals is recommended.
• Clinical trials, including pragmatic clinical trials, observational studies, use of existing
health data in different study designs, creation of large-scale databases and performing
meta-analyses may be considered for this topic. Use of existing data should always be
considered to add value, increase quality and increase implementation speed of the
study. Regarding databases, sustainability after the proposed action's end also needs to
be considered.
• The proposed research needs to take into account sex and gender aspects.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.
The Commission will ensure an overall coordination mechanism between the projects funded
under this topic to catalyse the exchange of knowledge, as well as the development and
adoption of best practices. Proposals are expected to budget for the attendance to regular
meetings. Projects resulting from this call will be invited to share and discuss their case
studies amongst themselves and with relevant stakeholders at the EU level, and necessary
resources should be allocated to this task.

• A diverse and comprehensive EU landscape of multi-country adaptive platform trials
(i.e. able to study multiple interventions in a disease or condition in a perpetual manner,
thus allowing modification to the trial after its initiation without undermining its validity
and integrity) that assess vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases, and have the
capacity to pivot rapidly in the case of epidemic or pandemic health threats.
• Innovative and improved design of clinical studies, suited for pandemic preparedness, is
available for the clinical research community, taking into account the high safety
standards in the European regulatory environment.
• Trial sites across multiple countries have the capacity to deliver robust clinical evidence
in a diverse European population, using harmonised research methods, data collection
and analysis.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases remain a major threat to
health and health security in the EU and globally. Health threats are expected to arise due to
among others, climate change, and thus a need for proactive approaches to ensure timely
availability of medical countermeasures during disease outbreaks is anticipated. The conduct
of perpetual adaptive platform trials, with the in-built agility to pivot when an epidemic
strikes, is key to be prepared for infectious disease epidemics or pandemics.
This topic aims to provide funding to adaptive clinical platform trials that may be
implemented routinely outside of an epidemic or pandemic context, but that are designed to
be ready for the timely assessment of novel diagnostics, therapeutics or vaccines in the face of
an epidemic or pandemic.
Proposals should develop the wide range of elements needed to sustain multi-country adaptive
platform trials, including the trial implementation capacity, laboratory analysis capacity, and a
harmonised approach to the collection, storage, sharing and analysis of FAIR165 data.
Proposals should ensure timely engagement with regulatory authorities and bodies. Proposals
should consider the European regulatory environment and take full use of the European
capacity to deliver quality trials, including the possibility for registration of new medical
products. Proposals should strengthen the leading role of the EU in clinical research
preparedness for future epidemics and pandemics.
The proposals should address the following areas:
• Development of robust clinical evidence that contributes to the knowledge base for the
diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. Sex, gender, age, ethnicity
and socio-economic factors should be taken into account.
• Known hurdles related to ethical, administrative, regulatory, legal and logistical aspects
should be anticipated and addressed to the extent possible, in order to avoid such barriers
when the trial needs to pivot in response to an epidemic or pandemic.

• Engagement with clinical researchers and biostatisticians, to increase capacity for the
design and implementation of adaptive platform trials across Europe.
Collaboration and coordination with existing adaptive platform trials in the EU is expected,
where relevant, as well as with the coordination mechanisms established under topic
HORIZON-HLTH-2023-DISEASE- 3.05 and with the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
Collaboration and coordination with other organisations and other regional and global
initiatives, such as Global Health EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking166, the Global Research
Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R)167, the European Pandemic
Preparedness Partnership and the European Health Preparedness and Emergency Response

storage and sharing of collected data according to FAIR 169 principles, thereby
encouraging further use of the data.
• Policymakers, funders, scientific and clinical communities, patient organisations,
regulators and other relevant bodies are informed of the research advances made, while
health professionals envisage use of the biomarker tests for early detection of the
disorder and for guiding patients in the selection of personalised
treatments/interventions.
• Patients and caregivers are sufficiently engaged with the research, which also caters for
their needs.
Scope: Treatments for some high-burden brain disorders are potentially on the horizon170.
Consequently, many patients and citizens will want to know if they are eligible for these
treatments. For some disorders, a definitive diagnosis is difficult, expensive and time-
consuming. Simple blood or other fluid-derived (e.g. saliva, urine, sweat) tests for markers
that may indicate early signs of the disorder, and which can be deployed for widespread
clinical use are needed.
The brain disorders within the scope of this topic fall under two categories, namely those
listed under chapters six and eight of the International Classification of Diseases171. Proposals
in the area of mental disorders are encouraged.
Proposals should address all of the following aspects:
• Proposals should aim to validate biomarkers that can reliably confirm early stages of the
human brain disorder and guide treatment/ intervention selection172.
• Proposals should aim to provide evidence supporting the regulatory acceptance of the
biomarkers173.
• Exploitation of existing data, biobanks, registries and cohorts is expected, together with
the generation of new key data.
• Inclusion of patients or patient organisations in the research is strongly encouraged, as to
ensure that their views are considered.
• Sex and gender aspects, age, socio-economic, lifestyle and behavioural factors should be
taken into consideration in the study.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:
• The scientific and clinical communities make effective use of state-of-the-art
information, data, technologies, tools and best practices to better understand the
condition, underpinning the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and/or preventive
strategies.
• The scientific and clinical community exchange data, knowledge and best practices,
thereby strengthening their collaboration and building knowledge and care networks in
Europe and beyond.
• The scientific and clinical community make wide use of newly established and where
relevant open access databases and/or integrate them with existing infrastructures for
storage and sharing of collected data according to FAIR 176 principles, thereby
encouraging further use of the data.
• Policymakers and funders are informed of the research advances made and consider
further support in light of the sustainability of the studies.

Health
• Patients and caregivers are constructively engaged with the research, which also caters
for their needs.
• Health professionals have access to and use improved clinical guidelines on diagnosis
and/or treatment of the condition.
Scope: A number of medical conditions fail to be recognised and/or be correctly diagnosed in
a significant proportion of patients. As a consequence they are inadequately treated and often
can become a chronic and high burden for the patient. These medical conditions177 may be
insufficiently researched even though they manifest with high prevalence178, 179.
This topic excludes rare diseases.
Proposals should address all of the following aspects:
• Proposals should address the gaps in robust, scientific evidence for improved policies
and practices to tackle such medical condition(s), and aim at identifying the
pathophysiological mechanism(s) (e.g. genetic, cellular and molecular) and potential risk
factors (e.g. psychological and environmental) of the medical condition(s) through basic,
pre-clinical and/or clinical research. These efforts should underpin the development of
diagnostics, therapeutics, and/or preventive strategies for the condition.
• Proposals should demonstrate that the medical condition(s) under study is/are
insufficiently understood, inaccurately diagnosed or inadequately treated in a significant
proportion of patients, and as such represent a high burden for patients and society. This
could be through referencing key literature.
• Sex and gender aspects, age, ethnicity, socio-economic, lifestyle and behavioural factors
should be taken into consideration. In addition, the emotional and societal long-term
effects of these chronic disorders for the affected individuals should be addressed.
• Where applicable, the development of biomarkers and other technologies for diagnosis,
monitoring in patients, and stratification of patient groups should be considered.
• Where applicable, the development of clinically relevant, (non-)human model systems
that can complement clinical investigations should be considered.
• Exploitation of existing data, biobanks, registries and cohorts is expected, together with
the generation of new (e.g. genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) data.
177 High-burden medical conditions could for instance include those that are either life-threatening or lead
to chronic invalidity or a severely reduced quality of life.
178 Examples of medical conditions include chronic Lyme disease, Myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic
fatigue syndrome and low back pain.
179 The European Commission commissioned an independent scoping study to help identify high-burden
under-researched medical conditions and define the type of research and/or research priorities to better
address the different needs of patients with these conditions. The study delivered a discussion paper
with a non-exhaustive list of conditions/groups of disorders identified as being high-burden and under-
researched. This document is available at https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-

• To enable sharing of samples, quality data and advanced analytical tools, it is
encouraged to make use of existing infrastructures developed at the European180 or
national level.
• Inclusion of patients or patient organisations in the research is strongly encouraged, to
ensure that their views are considered.
• SME participation is strongly encouraged.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)

Scope: The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated how unilateral research initiatives may lead to a
fragmented research landscape, with substantial room for efficiency gains in the development
of the highly needed evidence to guide policy actions when facing an emergency. The
European partnership for pandemic preparedness is working to improve the EU’s
preparedness to predict and respond to emerging infectious health threats by better
coordinating funding for research and innovation at EU, national (and regional) level towards
common objectives and an agreed Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. Such a
partnership contributes to building a coherent European Research Area (ERA), enabling
Member States, Associated Countries and the European Commission to rapidly and jointly
support research and innovation in pandemic preparedness.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
• The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge on viruses with
epidemic potential and in particular a better understanding of pathogen–host interactions
for the targeted development of vaccines and inhibitors for the prevention of viral
infection and the viral transmission during pathogenesis.
• The scientific and clinical communities have access to novel approaches for the
prevention and treatment for emerging and re-emerging infections in the context of
epidemic and pandemic preparedness.
• The scientific and clinical communities have access to experimental vaccine candidates
and candidates that inhibit cellular uptake of viruses against emerging or re-emerging
viral infections for further clinical investigation.
A diverse and robust development pipeline of vaccine candidates and candidates that inhibit
cellular uptake of viruses is available to fight emerging and re-emerging viral infections,
increasing therapeutic options for clinical deployment in case of an epidemic or pandemic.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases remain a major threat to
health and health security in the EU and globally. Viral disease emergence is expected to
accelerate due to among other factors, climate change, and thus a proactive approach to the
Part 4 - Page 110 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
development of vaccines and inhibitors for the cellular uptake of viruses in preparedness for
future infectious disease outbreaks is needed. The availability of vaccines and candidates that
inhibit cellular uptake of viruses would provide a critical preparedness measure against future
health threats, in particular against pathogens with high pandemic potential meeting the
criteria identified by the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA)184.
Proposals should follow innovative approaches to characterise host-pathogen interactions with
a view to inhibit viral replication, viral proteases, viral exit strategies and to develop
therapeutic antibodies and vaccines that target viruses with high epidemic or pandemic
potential for the EU. Proposals should focus on the following viruses: Hendra and Nipah
virus, Lassa virus, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Ebola
and Marburg virus, Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus, Zika virus, West Nile fever virus and
Chikungunya virus. Proposal should take into account sex and gender aspects.
Proposals should aim to diversify and accelerate the global therapeutic research and
development pipeline for emerging and re-emerging viral infections, and to strengthen the
current leading role of the EU in therapeutic research and development, and therefore
contributing to the work of the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response
Authority (HERA).
Proposals should address several of the following areas:
• Identification and characterisation of receptors on the host cell that enable the docking
and internalisation of a virus with a particular emphasis on the diversity of cellular entry
receptors and tissue specificity.
• Identification and characterisation of viral surface proteins that are capable of interacting
with host target cells.
• Characterisation of the mechanism of viral uptake in the host cell with regard to the
topology and the dynamics of the host receptor – virus ligand interaction.
• Identification of receptor and ligand (sub)units that could be targeted by preventive or
therapeutic intervention.
Proposals could consider the inclusion of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre
(JRC) research infrastructure (Nanobiotechnology laboratory) for biophysical characterisation
of recombinant proteins, antigens and therapeutic antibodies, and its expertise at the interface
between the research activities and regulatory aspects. In that respect, the JRC will consider
collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be
established after the proposal’s approval.
Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical
studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. See
definition of clinical studies in the introduction to this work programme part.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
• The EU’s response to curb antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is improved and the EU is
reinforced as an internationally recognised driver of research and innovation on AMR
thereby substantially contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development
Goals related to AMR;
• EU and national agencies, the scientific communities, policymakers and funders enhance
their collaboration and coordination for a strengthened ‘One Health (OH) approach to
fight antimicrobial resistance’ forming a strong and structured ecosystem with shared
evidence, tools and methodologies cutting across sectors;
• Research funders, policymakers, relevant agencies and authorities, and the research
community are in a position to close the current gaps and break existing silos on AMR in
accordance with the European One Health Action Plan against AMR187 and the EU
Council Recommendation to combat antimicrobial resistance in a one health
approach188;
• Research funders align, adopt and implement their research policies and activities
allowing for the optimal generation of novel solutions to prevent and treat infectious
diseases affected by AMR, improved surveillance and diagnosis and control of the
spread of resistant microorganisms, testing and validation of such solutions and
facilitating their uptake or implementation responding to the needs to reduce the burden
of AMR;
• The EU is strengthened as an internationally recognised actor for research and
innovation on AMR with a one health approach substantially contributing to global
cooperation and coordination by expanding beyond Europe;
• The research community at large benefit from and use an improved comprehensive
knowledge framework integrating the EU, national/regional data and information
infrastructures to improve transnational research.
Scope: The partnership should contribute to the priorities set in the European One Health
Action plan to fight AMR and in the Council Recommendation on stepping up EU actions to
combat antimicrobial resistance in a One Health approach that provide European frameworks
with actions and objectives focused on areas with the highest added value for Member States,
including boosting research development and innovation.

In this, the European Partnership One Health AMR should allow coordinating, aligning of
activities and funding among countries in the EU and beyond, as well as facilitating national
coherence on research and innovation between different services/ministries with responsibility
for the various aspects of AMR and sectors involved (e.g. human and animal health,
agriculture, environment, innovation).
This Partnership should also contribute to achieving the objectives of the Pharmaceutical
Strategy for Europe189, in terms of fulfilling unmet medical needs on AMR and ensuring that
the benefits of innovation reach patients in the EU, and support the objectives of the new
EU4Health Programme190, as well as supporting the objectives of the Farm to Fork
Strategy191.
Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health
authorities, citizens, healthcare providers, innovators, policymakers), the Partnership will
create a critical mass of resources and implement a long-term Strategic Research and
Innovation Agenda (SRIA)192.
The co-funded European Partnership on One Health AMR should be implemented through a
joint programme of activities ranging from coordinating transnational research efforts to other
activities such as coordination and networking activities, capacity building programmes,
brokerage and mobility programmes, work on research infrastructures and resources,
including training and dissemination activities.
The implementation of the future European Partnership on OH AMR should contribute to
build a European Research and Innovation Area (ERA) to rapidly and jointly support research
and innovation in the fight against AMR.
It should be structured along the following 3 main objectives:
1. Collaboration and alignment of Research and Innovation agendas on OH AMR
The Partnership should mobilise and link key AMR stakeholders, encompassing the human,
veterinary, agricultural and environmental disciplines and including a broad spectrum of
pathogens, bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, through a cross-cutting, interdisciplinary one
health approach. It should provide a framework to close the current knowledge gaps and break
existing silos in the AMR research landscape, facilitating the integration of national and
international scientific and policy communities with industry and the civil society.
For this, the partnership could support, although no limited to, the following activities:
• Joint strategic programming and global coordination of research and innovation through
an agreed One Health AMR SRIA to understand, prevent and tackle AMR (covering the
scientific areas Therapeutics, Surveillance, Detection, Diagnostics, Transmission and

research, economic, environment and social sciences).
• Target research and innovation efforts to actual needs (challenge-driven) of
policymakers and stakeholders.
• Create a transnational system that supports collaboration between EU, member states
and international initiatives on AMR research and innovation in a One Health approach.
2. Boost Research and Innovation
The OH AMR Partnership should strengthen the European Research Area by supporting
excellence in innovative research, capacity building, programmes for development of talent,
widening the engagement of countries and sectors not yet involved.
For this, the Partnership could support, although no limited to, the following activities:
• Support excellent AMR research and development with a one health approach on new
prevention methods, interventions, treatments and diagnostics through annual joint
transnational research calls and research network calls.
• Develop new tools and instruments to support research and innovation.
• Support networking, training and mobility of researchers.
• Facilitate sharing and use of data and research infrastructures.
3. Enhance knowledge translation and uptake
• Facilitate translation of scientific knowledge into innovative solutions.
• Connect, merge and align dissemination of outputs with other initiatives to support
evidence-based policy in whole One Health domain.
• Societal engagement by bridging science to society creating awareness of AMR
challenges, value creation, support the wellbeing of citizens and sustainability of the
environment.
The partnership should also:
Strengthen the OH AMR ecosystem with integrating activities engaging key actors for AMR
encompassing the field of human, veterinary and environmental disciplines and the broad
spectrum of pathogens, including fungi and viruses.
Implement collaborative activities with International Organisations such as the World Health
Organization (WHO), the World Animal Health Organisation (WOAH), the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), the G7
and G20 fora, and the global AMR R&D Hub, with the aim to avoid duplication of efforts.
Part 4 - Page 116 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
International cooperation is encouraged also with low- and middle-income countries where
AMR is highly prevalent and prone to spread to Europe.
Establish robust communication and effective information exchange between diverse
scientific disciplines and among multiple sectors of the society (as patients, clinicians,
veterinarians, pharmacists, food producers, pharmaceutical industry, policymakers and
researchers (including those working in the socio-economic, social sciences and humanities).
The Partnership’s governance structure should engage upfront the relevant actors to
coordinate, steer and frame the research and innovation activities, facilitate the use and uptake
of the results and contribute to a science-based communication of the risk of spread of AMR.
The Partnership’s governance and operational structures should also foster a dialogue on
sustainability, beyond funding from EU research and innovation framework programmes.
The governance should involve key stakeholders, including but not limited to the research and
innovation community, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, and innovation
owners.
The Partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to
Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wishing to join.
The Partnership should build on, be complementary to and go beyond the existing initiative
JPIAMR193.
To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and
investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with
other Horizon Europe partnerships (institutionalised and co-funded, such as the future
European Partnership Animal Health & Welfare 194) and missions as set out in the working
document on ‘Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon
Europe’195 as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and
international level. The proposals should also consider synergies with EU programmes,
including but not limited to EU4Health. The Partnership should align with EU-wide initiatives
on open access and FAIR data196.
Cooperation with international organisations, private sector and non-European institutions and
experts may be considered. Participation of third countries is encouraged. Their commitments
to the Partnership would not be eligible for the calculation of EU funding. Applicants should
describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to
achieve with this kind of collaboration.

Eligibility The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following
conditions exceptions apply:
In recognition of the opening of the US National Institutes of Health’s
programmes to European researchers, any legal entity established in the
United States of America is eligible to receive Union funding. Because
the US contribution will be considered for the calculation of the EU
contribution to the partnership, the concerned consortium of research
funders from eligible EU Members States and Associated Countries
must expressly agree to this participation.
The following exceptions apply: subject to restrictions for the protection
of European communication networks.

Agreements
to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. Financial
support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the primary
activities of the action in order to be able to achieve its objectives.
Given the type of action and its level of ambition, the maximum amount
to be granted to each third party is EUR 3.00 million. However, if the
objectives of the action would otherwise be impossible or overly
difficult (and duly justified in the proposal) the maximum amount may
be higher.
The funding rate is 50% of the eligible costs. This is justified by the
pooling of proposers' in-kind contributions and in-house activities and
by the nature of activities to be performed: in addition of joint calls,
sustain and further develop the EU-wide networks and infrastructures
for clinical research, and in particular a network of ever-warm clinical
trial sites.
Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. The partnership will be firmly anchored within the framework of the European
Health Union package199 that aims to improve the EU's capacity in the vital areas of
prevention, preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, early warning, and response. In this
regard, synergies and close collaboration with the European Health Emergency Preparedness
and Response Authority (HERA) and other relevant European Commission services need to
be ensured.
The partnership’s activities are expected to be key enablers of the EU Global Health
Strategy200, notably its guiding principle 5 to boost global health research and guiding
principle 7 to strengthen capacities for prevention, preparedness and response, particularly to
expand and strengthen European and global research partnerships including clinical trial
networks that can be pivoted to address new and emerging pathogens.
Proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards,
and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:

• The EU offers a valued network of clinical trial sites that have the capacity to implement
well-coordinated large-scale multi-country quality trials in different target populations,
which are able to smoothly transition to public health interventions relevant for cross-
border health threats in response to a public health emergency;
• Relevant EU and national entities, the scientific communities and networks,
policymakers and funders enhance their collaboration and coordination for strengthened
research on pandemic preparedness and response, forming a strong and structured
ecosystem with shared evidence, tools and methodologies cutting across sectors;
• Research funders, policymakers, relevant EU and national entities, and the research
community recognise and close rapidly relevant research and related infrastructure gaps
and break existing silos on pandemic preparedness research and response;
• Healthcare authorities, regulatory authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders use
the research results to develop evidence-based strategies and policies for pandemic
preparedness and response, and deploy good practices to European countries and
regions, and beyond whenever relevant;
• The research community at large benefits from and uses an improved comprehensive
knowledge framework integrating the EU, national/regional data and information
infrastructures to improve transnational research in the area of pandemic preparedness
and response;
• The EU is strengthened as an internationally recognised actor for pandemic preparedness
research and response, as such substantially contributing to global cooperation and
coordination.
Scope: The COVID-19 pandemic uncovered the challenges that European health care systems
face in detecting, preventing, combatting and managing outbreaks of infectious diseases in a
coordinated manner. It also illustrated the need for stronger preparedness and networks for
research and timely clinical trials and observational studies, for more timely availability of
medical countermeasures, such as vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, as well as more
appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions and adequate communication strategies in terms
of fighting mis/disinformation and fostering appropriate behaviours. Furthermore, it showed
how unilateral research initiatives may lead to a fragmented, inefficient research landscape.
At the same time, the relentless work of the research community that has led to availability of
several COVID-19 vaccines in record time highlighted the critical importance of collaborative
R&I to respond rapidly to emerging health threats.
Therefore, transformative investments in research for pandemic preparedness are needed at
European level. Stronger collaboration and coordination between European actors, including
the appropriate infrastructures and networks, are an important prerequisite for improving
EU’s pandemic preparedness and stepping up our contribution to global cooperation in this
area.

This should be done through a partnership that promotes:
• improved coordination and cooperation to adjust research and innovation agendas on
national and European levels (and contributing globally), as essential part of the
pandemic preparedness planning and implementation activities;
• coordination and prioritisation of a comprehensive research response to a health
emergency, from basic research for better understanding of pathogens with pandemic
potential to the development or adaptation of medical countermeasures, as well as
effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and/or public health and social
measures (PHSM), and using an integrated One Health approach;
• the consolidation and further development of ever-warm EU-wide networks and
infrastructures for clinical research, controlled trials and observational studies for public
health interventions, such as EU-wide vaccine and treatment trials, PHSM/NPI trials or
cohorts;
• the provision of robust and timely scientific evidence to inform sound public health
decision-making in response to a public health emergency;
• the use of agreed data standards201 to safely collect, store, link and manage FAIR202 data
and to exploit the full potential of the generated data for modelling and in-silico methods
for epidemic surveillance, clinical trials and observational studies, among others.
The partnership should strengthen the European Research Area by supporting excellence in
innovative research, capacity building, programmes for development of talent, widening the
engagement of countries and sectors not yet involved.
The partnership should endorse a pandemic preparedness Strategic Research and Innovation
Agenda (SRIA) based on the work of the CSA BE READY and prepare for the management
of the research response during a crisis, by strengthening the collaboration between relevant
partners and the alignment of related investments. The partnership will consider the impact of
environmental, climatic issues and patterns in relation with the emergence and spread of
health threats to better understand how these increase the risk for emerging infectious
diseases, and how this should be integrated into the research done using a One Health
approach.
The scope of the partnership should encompass:
• basic research to accelerate the acquisition of knowledge on the biology of pathogens
with epidemic or pandemic potential, their transmission and interaction with humans,
animals and plants, in particular in view of emerging threats to human health. The initial
focus should be on pathogens with high epidemic or pandemic potential for the EU, such

as those included in the list of priority diseases of the World Health Organization
(WHO), with particular attention to those meeting the criteria identified by HERA203;
• preclinical research aimed at better understanding of human diseases caused by
pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential and testing of related medical
countermeasures;
• clinical research to support the generation of novel solutions, in particular the
development (phase I to phase III) of medical countermeasures, e.g. vaccines,
diagnostics, therapeutics and digital solutions, to prevent or mitigate outbreaks from
pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential, in line with the mission of HERA and
the ACT EU initiative204;
• a key feature should be the consolidation and further development of an ever-warm
network of clinical trial sites205 applying the same quality standards and ensuring a
baseline of continuous clinical trial activity across a wide and diverse range of clinical
trial sites, to allow for a rapid clinical trial response in case of an epidemic or pandemic.
This includes the development of criteria for a clinical trial site to be considered as ever-
warm;
• the development, testing and validation of new methods and tools, including those based
on artificial intelligence and computer modelling, to improve surveillance and
diagnosis and control of the spread of pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential;
• the conduct of public health and social sciences and humanities (SSH) research for
the development and robust evaluation of appropriate non-pharmaceutical
interventions/public health and social measures and effective communication strategies
at all phases of a public health emergency;
• the consolidation and/or development of infrastructures, platforms and networks
necessary for fast and timely start of the response research, capitalising on previous
investments and existing infrastructures supporting collaboration, trans-boundary access
and provision of services, such as provided by ISIDORe206 or ECRIN207.
• capacity building through networking and training of researchers, to share
knowledge and good practices also with EU and national entities, policymakers and
funders.

It is intended to implement the partnership in two phases. The activities in the first phase
should mainly focus on:
• the way clinical trials are set up and conducted in the EU to address public health
emergencies, including new approaches such as computer modelling and in-silico
clinical trials.
 this will require coordination mechanisms to support prioritisation of emergency
trials, improved mechanisms to identify and rank promising compounds, mobilising
EU and Member State funding mechanisms, and measures to help speed up
contracting of clinical trial sites during emergencies and in preparedness time. For
this purpose, close collaboration with the EMA and its Emergency Task Force,
National Competent Authorities, Ethics Committees, and the European
Commission should be ensured.
 this includes the consolidation, integration and further expansion of EU-wide
network of ever-warm clinical trial sites, building on earlier made investments such
as Vaccelerate208, Ecraid209 and EU RESPONSE210. It is expected that the
partnership will develop a sustainable solution to ensure the long-term viability of
adequate European clinical trial networks for a timely public health emergency
response, which cover key target populations and have a suitable geographic
spread.
• implementing joint calls for transnational proposals to foster transnational research in the
other areas in the scope of the partnership.
• developing the roadmaps for the implementation of the remaining activities foreseen by
the partnership.
The second phase of the partnership is expected to build on this first phase, to further develop
and consolidate what has been achieved and implement the roadmaps developed for
remaining activities as outlined in the scope, with the possibility of expanding to new
partners.
The total indicative budget for the partnership is up to EUR 100 million and subject to the
effective implementation of the commitments made by the members of the consortium. The
Commission envisages to include new actions in its future work programmes to provide
continued support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.
The expected duration of the partnership is 7 to 10 years with the first phase having a duration
of 2 to 3 years.

As general principles, the partnership will:
• promote an inclusive membership and balanced geographic representation, open to third
countries and other relevant stakeholders;
• promote data sharing, data standards and data-based digital tools, and align with EU-
wide initiatives on open access and FAIR211 data, artificial intelligence and virtual
human twins;
• pay specific attention to the gender and sex dimensions, as well as representativeness
of different population groups including young people and vulnerable groups;
• foster the development and use of trustworthy artificial intelligence212, in all its three
dimensions (lawful, ethical and robust);
• ensure synergies and explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and
international level.
To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and
investment possibilities, the partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with
the relevant European Commission services, with other Horizon Europe projects, partnerships
(institutionalised and co-funded) and missions as set out in the working document on
‘Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe’213 as
well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level.
On top of this, the proposal should consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not
limited to EU4Health214, the Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL)215, the European Social
Fund Plus (ESF+)216, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)217, InvestEU218, the
Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF)219 and the Technical Support Instrument (TSI)220.
When defining calls for proposals, the partnership needs to consider the effective contribution
of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts,
institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful
and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

The partnership should create synergies with the European and Developing Countries Clinical
Trials Partnership (EDCTP) currently in its third iteration as Global Health EDCTP3221 Joint
Undertaking, that brings together 15 countries from Europe and 25 countries from sub-
Saharan Africa. EDCTP is already funding adaptive clinical trial networks spanning African
and European countries and a Clinical Trials Community Network222 The partnership should
also contribute to help achieve the goals of GloPID-R223, the coalition of research funders that
invests in research to improve pandemic preparedness & response.
The partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon
Europe and will remain open to third countries wishing to join. Applicants should describe in
their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with
this kind of collaboration. Cooperation with international organisations, private sector and
non-European institutions and experts may be considered.
Governance
The partnership’s governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective
management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and
uptake of the results. The governance should involve key stakeholders and interested parties,
including but not limited to the research and innovation community, public health authorities,
patients and citizens, health and care professionals, formal and informal care organisations,
innovation owners, and relevant EU entities, including the European Commission, the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Medicines Agency.
Resources
The proposal should pool the necessary cash and in-kind resources from the participating
national (or regional) research programmes, in order to:
• sustain and further develop the EU-wide networks and infrastructures for clinical
research, and in particular a network of ever-warm clinical trial sites by running
continuous preparedness trials in relevant target populations;
• implement joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.
Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the activities of
this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives;
• conduct capacity building activities;
• implement any other activities, coordinated between (a group of) partnership members,
that contribute to the achievement of the partnership’s objectives. Research projects
resulting from coordinated national calls could be envisaged in this context as well.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
• Health care practitioners and providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
and/or those in high-income countries (HICs) serving disadvantaged populations have
access to and use specific guidelines to implement health interventions that improve the
availability of effective, equitable, efficient, integrated, patient-centred, safe, and timely
care and the overall quality of life for people living with multiple long-term conditions
including non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
Part 4 - Page 128 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Public health managers and authorities, including from other relevant sector (e. g.,
social, culture) have access to improved insights and evidence on how to decrease the
fragmentation of care for patients living with multiple chronic conditions, and ensure
continuity of care across all stages of disease progression. They use this knowledge to
design policies to reduce health inequities.
• Adopting an implementation science approach to studying interventions for management
of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs, researchers, clinicians and
authorities have an improved understanding how the proposed interventions could be
adopted in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations of HICs setting, taking into account
specific social, political, economic and cultural contexts.
• Communities and local stakeholders and authorities are fully engaged in implementing
and taking up interventions for management of multiple long-term conditions in the
context of NCDs and thus contribute to deliver better health.
Scope: The European Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases
(GACD)226, an alliance of international funding agencies representing over 80% of the
world’s public health research funding and the first collaboration of its kind to specifically
address NCDs. The GACD supports implementation science to improve health outcomes.
This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members and aligned with the 9th
GACD call.
The topic is focused on implementation research for management of multiple long-term
conditions in the context of NCDs (MLTC NCD) in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations
in HICs. Proposals should focus on implementation science around interventions that will
generate evidence about when, for whom, and under what circumstances, patient-centred
approaches can improve integrated care for patients with MLTC NCD.
MLTC NCD refers to the co-occurrence of multiple chronic conditions, at least one of which
is an NCD. NCDs include for example cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases,
cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, hypertension, haematological disorders, sleep
disorders, and mental health disorders. The high prevalence of MLTC NCD is projected to
rise with the ageing population and the increasing burden of NCDs. MLTC NCD has a
profound impact on patients, and is associated with premature death, physical disability,
substance abuse, poor quality of life, mental health issues, and financial difficulties from high
costs of care. It is also associated with difficulties in adherence to and high rates of adverse
effects from treatment with multiple medications. In addition, due to poor health and the
complexity of managing their conditions, patients with MLTC NCD are high utilisers of
health care systems, which is especially challenging in low-resourced contexts.
Addressing MLTC NCD demands a shift from fragmented models of care, which treat
individual health issues separately as they occur, to a more holistic integrated care model that
226 https://www.gacd.org/
Part 4 - Page 129 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
provides a whole person focus on health management227. The current evidence suggests that
primary healthcare228, integrated and coordinated care, patient-centred interventions, digital
health technology, and optimised medication therapy are key to improved management of
MLTC NCD. However, implementing patient-centred strategies for treating MLTC NCD
remains challenging and largely unexplored in disadvantaged contexts, especially in LMICs.
Adapting and scaling such models is critical to improving quality of life; reducing disability;
reducing the burden of caretaking on (typically female) family members and reducing health
system costs.
The proposed implementation research must focus on one or more evidence-based
interventions (or complex interventions) known to promote integrated management of
multiple long-term conditions, including NCDs. It should assess patient-centred interventions
focused on patient management or self-management, or interventions that transform
communities, clinical practice, and/or health systems. Applicants should justify the choice of
intervention(s) and provide evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness, acceptability,
feasibility, and potential for long-term health and other impacts. Ideally, evidence of the
intervention’s real-world effectiveness should be supported by a well-conducted systematic
review where available. As the evidence for how to manage MLTC NCD is still emerging,
particularly in LMICs, a limited period of testing the effectiveness of an intervention that the
applicant’s team has adapted for local implementation is therefore usually appropriate.
Applicants must explore the implementation of proposed intervention(s) for a selected study
population(s) taking into account the unique social, political, economic, and cultural
context(s) in which the study will take place. Applicants should justify why any adaptation
will not compromise the known effectiveness of the selected intervention(s).
Proposals should address all of the following activities229:
• Provide a research plan using validated implementation research frameworks or hybrid
design research;
• Have an appropriate strategy for measuring implementation research outcomes and real-
world effectiveness outcomes and indicators;
• Specifically address health equity and the principles of Universal Health Coverage230;
227 In keeping with the principles of Universal Health Coverage, the World Health Organization advocates
that health systems move towards offering a continuum of quality NCD preventative, diagnostic,
curative, rehabilitative, and palliative care services, that are available and accessible to all, independent
of economic circumstances.
228 https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/primary-health-care
229 The following types of projects will NOT be funded: i) proposals focused on primary prevention of
NCDs or other chronic conditions; ii) proposals with the primary aim of informing the development
and/or selection of an intervention for a given context, where the implementation component will be
explored in a future project; iii) epidemiological cohorts; iv) etiological work, mechanistic, or
epidemiological research, unless an essential component of a focused study to develop implementation
research approaches; v) clinical trials, validation studies, or intervention efficacy studies for a new or
established pharmacological agent or behavioural intervention.

• Engage an appropriately expert and skilled research team which can ensure a suitable
multidisciplinary approach and that demonstrates equitable partnership and shared
leadership between HIC-LMIC, and/or non-Indigenous–Indigenous members of the
project team and external stakeholders through a clear governance strategy;
• Provide a stakeholder engagement strategy with evidence of support/engagement from
key stakeholders for delivering patient-centred care and a pathway to sustain the
proposed intervention after the funding ends;
• Provide opportunities for implementation research capacity building for early career
researchers and team members from lower resourced environments, such as LMICs or
disadvantaged communities.
• Ensure meaningful involvement of early career team members, including at least one
early career member as a co-investigator.
Applicants are also encouraged to follow a life course approach, adapting the intervention to
one or more key life stage(s) critical for reducing the onset or progression of MLTC NCD,
and to explore how to best implement digital technology interventions.
The study population may include patients with existing MLTC NCD, or existing NCDs (e.g.,
studies focusing on rolling out screening services for multiple NCDs). The study population
may also include patients with chronic infectious disease(s) (e.g., studies that focus on
integrating NCD management into an HIV or tuberculosis clinic) or a mixture of both.
The following are potential interventions or strategies that applicants may consider in their
implementation plan (please note that this is not an exhaustive list):
• Strategies for improving MLTC NCD identification, stratification/staging, management,
and/or monitoring such as investigating strategies for adapting and implementing the
protocol(s) described in the WHO Package of Essential NCD Interventions (WHO
PEN)231 that address MLTC NCD management. For example, projects may focus on
integrating NCD care into clinics that typically focus on the management of infectious
diseases, such as HIV or tuberculosis clinics, or the integration of NCD care into
maternal and child health clinics;
• Strategies to streamline and improve quality of care among individuals with MLTC
NCD to reduce fragmentation of services, including task-sharing and/or the use of
clinical decision-making tools (e.g., digital tools);
• Strategies and/or tools (e.g., digital tools) that optimise appropriate medication and (non-
pharmacological) therapeutic prescribing, adherence, and/or reduced drug interactions/
adverse effects;

• Interventions that improve transitions through the health system, from community to
primary to tertiary care and beyond, such as to home care or hospice;
• Health behavioural change interventions that target different risk factor clusters (e.g.,
exercise, nutrition, tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse).
The proposal’s primary outcome measures must be implementation research outcomes to
assess MLTC NCD. With regard to MLTC NCD, applicants are encouraged to explore any
combination of chronic conditions, including mental health disorders and sleep disorders. The
specific combination of conditions should be justified using local or regional epidemiological
data about their co-occurrence. Outcome measures should appropriately address
implementation tackling MLTC NCD, and not focus on one condition. Proposals may also
contain a strategy for measuring other secondary outcomes (or proxy outcomes) that
demonstrate the intervention’s real-world effectiveness in the local context and target
populations. Additionally, other health or non-health outcome measures, especially those
identified as important by patient participants and/or critical for advancing Universal Health
Coverage, are also welcome.
Poverty, racism, ethnic discrimination, and other inequities are directly associated with
reduced potential for equitable access to quality care. Proposals should consider the social
determinants of health and discuss their potential impact on the effective implementation of
the intervention(s). If there is a focus on a particular population (e.g., gender, ethnicity), then
the reason for this should be justified.
In order to promote health equity, proposals should aim to address differences in intervention
access, uptake, and effectiveness in socially disadvantaged groups and develop strategies for
reducing inequities. To facilitate this process at the data analysis stage, studies should be
designed to address such differences. At a minimum, studies should capture sex and/or gender
differences. If feasible, a plan for capturing intersectional impacts on health outcomes should
be included in the analysis strategy.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.
For implementation research to have a strong likelihood of being taken up into policy or
practice and informing the scale up of effective interventions, it is vital that project teams
engage the appropriate stakeholders. Proposals should present a strategy to include the
relevant decision makers such as policymakers, ministry officials, local authorities, non-
governmental organisation leaders, community leaders as well as other stakeholders such as
community groups, or other individuals or organizations involved in the implementation of
the intervention, from the development to the implementation knowledge translation phase. It
is also important to include stakeholders who can help sustain the project’s implementation,
facilitate scale up, and use the knowledge generated from the project after the grant ends.

Stakeholders also include patients, their family members and carers. Their contributions
should be nurtured through meaningful engagement from the outset, not only as participants
in the research undertaken. Patient engagement throughout the research project is critical to
developing patient-centred models of care.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and
joint activities, including internationally, as appropriate. These activities could, for example,
involve the participation in joint workshops, the Annual Scientific Meetings of the GACD, the
exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint
communication activities. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for such
activities and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without
the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint
activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are
directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
• Investments in research and innovation on pandemic preparedness are balanced and
better co-ordinated along the whole research continuum from basic research, over pre-
clinical research to clinical research;
• Research funders, policymakers and the research community dispose of an enhanced
research and innovation framework for the European partnership for pandemic
preparedness, including the Partnership’s objectives, governance and ways of
working/operationalisation;
• Research funders, policymakers and the research community are aligned towards
common objectives and have a common understanding of the long-term Strategic
Research and Innovation Agenda for the Partnership;
• Research funders, policymakers and the research community work towards a valued
network of clinical trial sites that has the capacity to implement well-coordinated large-
scale multi-country quality trials in different target populations, which are able to
smoothly transition to public health interventions relevant for cross-border health threats
in response to a public health emergency;
• Healthcare providers, European and international stakeholders engage with an extended
number of EU-wide appropriate partners through the research and innovation framework
for the partnership.
Scope: The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated how unilateral research initiatives may lead to a
fragmented research landscape, with substantial room for efficiency gains in the development
of the highly needed evidence to guide policy actions when facing an emergency. A
coordination and support action234 is working towards improving the EU’s preparedness to
predict and respond to emerging infectious health threats by better coordinating funding for
research and innovation at EU, national (and regional) level towards common objectives and

an agreed Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. This work should be complemented by
efforts towards establishing, maintaining and enhancing a network of ever-warm clinical trials
sites and infrastructures for clinical research, ready to be pivoted in case of a pandemic or
epidemic episode. In addition, this work should be extended to additional partners, primarily
from the EU and Horizon Europe associated countries. Participation from widening countries
should be ensured, promoting an inclusive approach in the design and governance of the
partnership.
The partnership will contribute to building a coherent European Research Area (ERA),
enabling Member States, Associated Countries and the European Commission to rapidly and
jointly support research and innovation in pandemic preparedness.
The Partnership is expected to continue to build on existing pandemic preparedness networks
and research infrastructures and work in synergy with the Health Emergency Preparedness
and Response Authority (HERA).
Proposals should include all of the following activities:
• Provide administrative and organisational support to prepare, ensure a smooth start and
transition towards the European partnership for pandemic preparedness that will
eventually take over these tasks;
• Actively engage with relevant stakeholders and initiatives in the area of pandemic
preparedness, ensuring collaboration and coordination, and avoiding duplication; e.g. the
Global Health EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking, GloPID-R, WHO R&D blueprint, ACT
Accelerator, etc.;
• Implement strong communication and dissemination activities at EU level and in
Member States and Associated Countries, on the purpose, activities and outputs of the
European partnership for pandemic preparedness, ensuring a continuous dialogue, both
outside and during epidemic/pandemic episodes;
• As relevant, apply a cross-cutting, interdisciplinary One Health approach.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.

Destination 4. Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality
health care
Calls for proposals under this destination are directed towards the Key Strategic Orientation
KSO-D ‘Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society’ of Horizon
Europe’s Strategic Plan 2021-2024. Research and innovation supported under this destination
should contribute to the impact areas ‘Good health and high-quality accessible health care’
and ‘A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats’, and in particular to the following
expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: ‘Health care systems
provide equal access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care thanks to the
development and uptake of safe, cost-effective and people-centred solutions, with a focus on
population health, health systems resilience, as well as improved evidence-based health
policies’. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also
contribute to the following impact areas: ‘Climate change mitigation and adaptation’, ‘High
quality digital services for all’ and ‘A Competitive and secure data economy’.
Health systems are affected by limitations in sustainability and resilience, challenges which
have been reinforced by the COVID-19 crisis that has also revealed inequalities in access to
high-quality health care services. Our health systems need to become more effective, efficient,
accessible, fiscally and environmentally sustainable, and resilient in order to cope with public
health emergencies, to adapt to environmental challenges like climate change and to
contribute to social justice and cohesion. Therefore, the transformation and modernisation of
our health systems will be one of the biggest challenges in the economic recovery-bound
future, but it will also be a time of opportunity for generating evidence, taking advantage of
digital and data-driven innovation and developing more flexible and equitable health systems.
Under this destination, research and innovation aims at supporting health care systems in their
transformation to ensure fair access to sustainable health care services of high quality for all
citizens. Funded activities should support the development of innovative, feasible,
implementable, financially sound and scalable solutions in the various dimensions of health
care systems (e.g. governance, financing, human and physical resources, health service
provision, and patient empowerment). Ultimately, these activities should improve governance
and provide decision-makers with new evidence, methods, tools and technologies for uptake
into their health care systems and supporting health care professionals and providers and
allocating resources according to citizens’ health needs and preferences, while ensuring fiscal
and environmental sustainability to assure those needs can be met on the long-term. Funded
activities should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture
of dialogue and openness between citizens, patients, caregivers, health care providers and
other relevant stakeholders, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.
In this work programme, destination 4 will focus on the following issues:
Part 4 - Page 137 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Accelerating the development of personalised medicine in the EU and Associated
Countries, especially through a public-public cofunded partnership on personalised
medicine
• Increasing access to health and care services for patients and citizens, and especially for
people in vulnerable situations and at risk of discrimination
• Improving the resilience and mental wellbeing of the health and care workforce,
including informal carers
• Enhancing development and uptake of research and innovation in health and care
systems, including environmental transformation of the systems and contributions to the
European Green Deal.
In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European
Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable
cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities
such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and
adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential
synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects
funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing
projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to
European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic
challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas
cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance,
with cluster 2 “Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society” such as on health economics and
economic models, on cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and accessibility of health care,
or on adaptation of public health systems to societal challenges (climate change,
environmental degradation, migration, demographic change, emerging epidemics and One
Health AMR) thereby contributing to building resilience; with cluster 3 “Civil Security for
Society” such as on security of health care infrastructures, incl. digital health infrastructures,
health systems preparedness and response to disasters and other emergencies, and quality and
safety of medicine (counterfeit and substandard medicine, illicit drugs, One Health AMR);
with cluster 4 “Digital, Industry and Space” such as on cybersecurity of (public) health
systems, products and infrastructures of digitalised health and care, or on health impact
assessment (e.g. related to consumer products, working place innovation); with cluster 5
“Climate, Energy and Mobility”; and cluster 6 “Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources,
Agriculture and Environment”.
Expected impacts:
Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to
ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care, and more specifically
to one or several of the following impacts:
Part 4 - Page 138 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Health and social care services and systems have improved governance mechanisms and
are more effective, efficient, accessible, resilient, trusted and sustainable, both fiscally
and environmentally. Health promotion and disease prevention will be at their heart, by
shifting from hospital-centred to community-based, people-centred and integrated health
care structures and successfully embedding technological innovations that meet public
health needs, while patient safety and quality of services are increased.
• Health care providers are trained and equipped with the skills and competences suited
for the future needs of health care systems that are modernised, digitally transformed and
equipped with innovative tools, technologies and digital solutions for health care. They
save time and resources by integrating and applying innovative technologies, which
better involve patients in their own care, by reorganising workflows and redistributing
tasks and responsibilities throughout the health care system, and by monitoring and
analysing corresponding health care activities.
• Citizens are supported to play a key role in managing their own health care, informal
carers (including unpaid carers) are fully supported (e.g. by preventing overburdening
and economic stress) and specific needs of more vulnerable groups are recognised and
addressed. They benefit from improved access to health care services, including
financial risk protection, timely access to quality essential health care services, including
safe, effective, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines.
• Health policy and systems adopt a holistic approach (individuals, communities,
organisations, society) for the evaluation of health outcomes and value of public health
interventions, the organisation of health care, and decision-making.
The actions resulting from the calls under this destination will also create strong opportunities
for synergies with the EU4Health programme and in particular to contribute to the goals
under the general objective “protecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats
to health and specific objective 4 “to strengthen health systems, their resilience and resource
efficiency”.

Part 4 - Page 142 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Decision- and policymakers have access to modelling tools and foresight studies
(including cost studies on the non-access to health and care services) on health and care
systems240 for anticipating regular241 and unplanned health and care demand during
large-scale cross-border emergencies242.
• Decision- and policymakers and health and care providers can better facilitate and
manage access to regular health and care delivery during cross-border emergencies.
• Decision- and policymakers and health and care providers avail of management
frameworks including organisational models for handling unplanned health and care
demand linked to cross-border emergencies, while maintaining necessary regular health
and care provision.
• Health and care professionals have access to training on how to deliver regular health
and care services (including by means such as telemedicine) during cross-border health
emergencies.
• Health and care professionals, citizens and patients access advanced digital tools
enabling managed access to regular health and care services, complemented by other
modes of health and care delivery (e.g., telemedicine, self-care, prioritised care).
• Patients can be involved in the co-design and co-production of health and care delivery
models during cross-border emergencies and can benefit from better access to regular
health and care services during such periods.
• Health and care providers and health and care professionals have access to knowledge
and data on, and innovative solutions to combat, decreasing demand for regular health
and care services resulting from an ongoing emergency (e.g. patients are avoiding visits
to hospitals because they are worried about additional infections or do not want to add
extra burden on the health and care systems).
Scope: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, health and care systems have been
facing unprecedented challenges. Many systems were overwhelmed and fell short on
available supplies, staff, and critical infrastructure. Beyond the initial challenges posed by the
pandemic, its prolonged duration has strained health and care facilities and providers, and had
a negative impact on regular health and care provision. Disruptions in routine and non-
240 “Health and care systems” implies a broader notion than “health systems” or “healthcare systems”
notably encompassing all parts of health systems and health related parts of social care systems.
241 Regular care refers to the care that would be expected to be needed and delivered under normal
circumstances. This includes all types of morbidities (chronic diseases, mental health disorders, trauma
care etc.) and also all parts of the health and care systems (prevention, follow-up, long-term care,
primary care, both in- and out hospital care etc.), as well as related support services such as laboratories.
242 Cross-border emergency refers to an emergent situation that spreads or entails a significant risk of
spreading across the national borders of Member States and Associated Countries, and which may
necessitate coordination at Union level in order to ensure a high level of human health protection (Art.
2(1) Regulation on serious cross-border threats to health). In this topic, only emergency situations with
a high impact on health systems are included.
Part 4 - Page 143 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
emergency medical care access and delivery have been observed. It is hence timely to take
stock and identify lessons for maintaining care delivery.
Another recent emergency situation that has had a great impact on health and care systems is
the war in Ukraine and the resulting migration to bordering countries. Also under these
circumstances, it is important to have the right tools for maintaining access to regular health
and care services, while also accommodating the more urgent needs of migrants, for example.
The goal is to be better prepared for the multiple challenges faced by health and care systems
during emergencies, and ensure that necessary access to regular health and care services can
be maintained.
Proposals for research and innovation should focus on health and care systems, and actions
are expected to address several of the following:
• Analysis and evaluation of different epidemics or other emergencies response measures
in Member States and Associated Countries aimed at maintaining access to regular
health and care services. Cost studies on not maintaining access to health and care
services during cross-border emergencies.
• Development of innovative tools and models for maintaining access to regular health and
care services during cross-border emergencies – for example developing modelling and
foresight tools to assess and anticipate impact of cross-border emergencies on regular
health and care delivery; developing novel technical solutions or organisational
management models, including training, for regular care delivery in future cross-border
emergencies; demonstrating applicability of novel modelling tools, management
frameworks and organisational models in selected areas of regular health and care
services (e.g. chronic diseases, mental health disorders, trauma care).
• Development and implementation of digital tools and of effective communication
strategies based on digital health literacy studies – for example developing,
implementing and generating evidence of benefit of novel digital systems connecting
health and care professionals, citizens and patients at-scale, helping maintain access to
health and care services during emergencies (including but not limited to smart
appointment management, chronic disease self-management applications, primary care
and/or referral caseload prioritisation and management incl. triage, increasing clinical
practice efficiency, management of health care professionals’ caseload, integrated
telecare suites complemented by new computational methods such as AI/machine
learning, etc.).
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities. Interdisciplinary research is thus encouraged,
including the involvement of SSH disciplines considered essential for health and care

planning and delivery in different social contexts and for the evaluation of health economical
aspects.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and
joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance
to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint
activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of
these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.
Synergies should be sought with potentially complementary research initiatives, data
stewards, custodians and research infrastructures such as the European Observatory on Health
Systems and Policies, the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure, the future
European co-funded partnerships243, such as the partnership on Transforming Health and Care
Systems (THCS), and relevant EU health policy initiatives such as the European Health Data
Space (EHDS)244 and the nascent Health Emergency Response Authority (HERA)245.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 4 “Ensuring access to innovative,
sustainable and high-quality health care”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim
for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to several of the
following expected outcomes:
• Health and care workers receive support (including mental health support), access to
tools and guidance that enhances their wellbeing and ability to adapt to changing
working conditions, as a result of new technologies, new work models or unexpected
adverse events, including during public health emergencies and when under ethical
stress.
• Decision- and policymakers, employers and social partners in the health and care
sectors246 have knowledge of the specific risks for the resilience, mental health and well-
being of health and care professionals and informal carers. They have access to solutions
(regulatory, organisational, technological, educational, HR, health services) to prevent
and manage them, based on the integrated development of work processes and wellbeing
at work and on the study of effects of clustered work stressors on work ability and
recovery from work.
• Funders of health and care provision have access to evidence, novel approaches and
cost-effective recommendations for interventions supporting the mental health and well-
being of health and care workers at individual, organisation and sector levels.
• Policymakers cooperate with relevant stakeholders, including health and care
professionals associations and social partners to foster specific solutions to improve
resilience and well-being of health workers and carers including informal carers247, and
fight the accumulation of stressors.
Scope: A resilient workforce in the health and care sectors is essential for the sustainability
and prosperity of our societies. However, careers in the health and care sector can be
physically and mentally taxing by submitting health professionals and carers to psychosocial
risks (for example heavy workload, stressful working conditions, risk of exposure to
infectious agents, precariousness, ethical stress etc.). Many health professionals and carers
also commute to work or have migrated to work in a new country. This adds to the struggle of
health and care systems to attract new people to their workforce, but also to maintain the ones
already working. A combination of factors such as changes in work organisation, budgetary
and administrative pressures faced by health and care systems, systemic shortages of health
246 “Health and care systems” implies a broader notion than “health systems” or “healthcare systems”
notably encompassing all parts of health systems and health related parts of social care systems.
247 OECD definition: “Informal carers are defined as people providing any help to older family members,
friends and people in their social network, living inside or outside of their household, who require help
with everyday tasks.”

Health
professionals, precarious working conditions, structural inequalities and leaps in technological
innovation may leave health and care workers with feelings of helplessness, physical or
mental vulnerability or moral injury.
Technological innovations (including digitisation, big data and artificial intelligence
applications) provide opportunities for a more efficient provision of health and care services,
and for lightening the workload of health and care workers. However, they also create new
risks, potentially affecting the mental wellbeing of the workforce. For example, new skills,
requirements, new organisational models, performance monitoring by algorithms, lack of
control or accountability in workplace decisions, ethical questions, are elements that can
increase stress and hamper the ability of health and care workers to function in their jobs on a
daily basis.
The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on health and care workers’ resilience and
exacerbated mental health issues that were already a problem pre-pandemic, ranging from
anxiety due to increased workload to burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder. Informal
carers suffer from similar stress, potentially caused by different factors, such as the need to
provide care which keeps them away from employment and puts them at an increased risk of
poverty. Lack of acknowledgement that one’s mental health is deteriorating, barriers to
seeking help or the stigma that still surrounds mental illness may impede people from
addressing such problems early enough. Different socio-economic groups are affected to
different extents: in emerging virus outbreaks prior to the COVID-19 pandemic lower
educational level among other things was associated with higher risk for adverse
psychological outcomes among health workers248.
Successful proposals should address several of the following activities:
• Collect and analyse new evidence and data generation – on occupation-specific factors
building the resilience, mental health well-being of health and care workers, or informal
carers. Where appropriate, evidence should be gathered and analysed on the interplay of
such factors with non-occupation specific factors (e.g. genetic, social etc.). Where
relevant, such evidence should be target-group specific, considering variation of
challenges for professionals working in various settings (primary care, hospitals,
residential care institutions, disadvantaged geographic locations).
• Develop action-oriented recommendations to policymakers, employers, social partners
and relevant civil society organisations at the appropriate levels (EU, national, regional,
local) based on evidence generated by the proposed action. Such recommendations
should suggest (cost-)effective policy interventions or elements for further research
aiming to promote the resilience, mental health and well-being of health and care
workers. They should be based on cost-benefit studies and ex-ante evaluations of
proposed interventions.

• Develop, or identify, innovative solutions (including digitally enabled ones),
organisational models and management approaches to support health policymakers,
employers and formal or informal health and care workers in promoting resilience,
mental health and well-being in the workplace.
• Develop financing and resource allocation models to ensure access to support and mental
health services for health and care workers and informal carers.
• Carry out testing and validation activities for new or improved solutions249 improving
conditions for health and care workers or informal carers according to specific factors
influencing their mental well-being.
Proposals can identify one or more worker groups or informal carers as target of R&I
activities, based on credible scientific criteria.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, health and care professionals associations and (informal) carers
associations, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal
impact of the related research activities.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and
joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance
to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint
activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of
these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.
With women making up over 70% of EU health care professionals and employees in the care
sector and a great part of informal carers, an appropriate gender approach is essential in
research and policy interventions, to prevent or mitigate workplace inequalities and
imbalances. Researchers and policymakers should also take into account the inclusion
dimension, as a significant share of health professionals or care workers typically come from
minority groups, whether through declared or undeclared work.
Proposals should consider potential synergies and avoid overlaps with ongoing calls or
actions funded under EU or national programmes for example the future cofunded partnership
on Transforming Health and Care Systems (THCS).
Proposals are encouraged to take into account, when relevant, the EU Strategic Framework on
Health and Safety at Work (2021-2027)250, the report on mental health251 and most
importantly, the recommendations and analysis presented in the Expert Panel on effective
249 Practices can be shared via the Best Practice Portal (pb-portal (europa.eu). Examples of interventions
that were initiated to tackle the mental health impact of the pandemic are also available on the pages of
the dedicated web space on that topic on the Health Policy Platform https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/hpf/

Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions
Eligibility The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following
conditions exceptions apply:
In recognition of the opening of the US National Institutes of Health’s
programmes to European researchers, any legal entity established in the
United States of America is eligible to receive Union funding.
Award criteria The criteria are described in General Annex D. The following exceptions
apply:
The thresholds for each criterion will be 4 (Excellence), 4 (Impact) and 3
(Implementation). The cumulative threshold will be 12.
Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 4 “Ensuring access to innovative,
sustainable and high-quality health care”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim
for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following
expected outcomes:
• Policy and decision makers, providers of health and care, health and care workers and
citizens have increased knowledge on how today’s health and care systems252 are not
environmentally sustainable, what the possible costs of that are (today and future) and
where improvements are possible with maintained or improved quality of care (optimal
patient safety not being jeopardised) and possible investments needed.
252 “Health and care systems” implies a broader notion than “health systems” or “healthcare systems”
notably encompassing all parts of health systems and health related parts of social care systems.
Part 4 - Page 149 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Policy and decision makers and providers of health and care services have access to
innovative solutions, organisational models (including financing models), and guidelines
and recommendations that reduce the pollution and carbon emissions stemming from
health and care systems, so that health and care provision can become more sustainable
and cost-effective while maintaining or improving quality of care thanks to the reduction
of energy and materials use, decreased carbon emissions, reduced waste and discharges,
and efficient resource management.
• Monitoring and reporting of carbon emissions and pollution is mainstreamed through a
life-cycle approach and with standard methods in the health and care systems.
Scope: The health care sector is responsible for 4-5% of global total carbon emissions253, and
generates significant demands for energy and materials, as well as dangerous waste streams
that may cause air, soil and water pollution. At the same time, health and care provision
generally experiences less pressure to decarbonise and improve its circularity than other
sectors of the economy. With the European Green Deal, the EU commits to reducing net
greenhouse gas emission by at least 55% by 2030, and to reach no net emissions by 2050, and
the health and care systems are not exempt. Research and innovation can support by ensuring
a smooth transformation while maintaining or improving quality of health and care services.
Health and care systems are undergoing structural changes, for example by strengthening
primary care and community-based care, strengthening digitalisation and making sure patients
are treated or cared for at the most efficient level. This offers the possibility to connect
structural changes with an environmental transformation.
During COP26, 18 countries (including two EU Member States) have committed to cutting all
carbon emissions from their health systems over the next 10 to 30 years and during the same
period in total fifty countries (including six EU Member States) have committed to creating
climate resilient, low carbon, sustainable health systems.
In February 2022, the WHO published a report on the waste that had been generated as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, even more emphasising the need to improve waste
management systems of the health and care systems254. The report states that 30% of
healthcare facilities word-wide, and 60% in the least developed countries, are not fit to handle
the waste generated even when not taking the extra waste generated by the pandemic into
account. Not only does this pose environmental risks such as water and air pollution, but it
also poses a risk to health workers’ safety by increasing the risk of being exposed to stick
injuries, burns and pathogenic microorganisms.
Research and innovation activities under this topic should be specific to health and care
sectors. They should include cost studies when relevant (environmental impacts and benefits
to be quantified through the life cycle thinking approach (e.g. LCA/SLCA), to be effectively
implemented in line with the European Green Deal and the Zero Pollution Action Plan) and

piloting research results onsite in hospitals or other care settings while generating accessible
knowledge could be included. Apart from that, successful proposals should address several of
the following:
• Research and innovative solutions for decarbonisation of hospitals and other care
providers: improvements in new and existing building stock, decarbonisation of energy
supply to premises, reduction in energy demand of hospital sites and other care facilities
(for example heating and cooling, hot water, laundry, cooking, transport systems).
• Research and innovative solutions for increased circularity of hospitals or other care
providers that integrate the zero-pollution ambition: such as solutions to reduce waste,
improved waste management practices (with a possible focus on water effluents and
Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)), increased circularity (for example sustainable use of
linen).
• Research and innovative solutions for decarbonisation and greening of supply chains and
material inflows: reduction of single-use plastics, substitution of anaesthetic gases and
inhalers with high global warming potentials (GWPs), substitution of conventional
pharmaceuticals with green(er) alternatives, low-carbon supply chains of food, waste
reduction, management models on for example prescription of pharmaceuticals.
• Development of a framework to measure and benchmark the environmental footprint of
the health and care sectors or improving infrastructures for relevant collecting, sharing,
accessing and processing of data.
Projects with interdisciplinary teams representing the health and care sectors, and the
environmental sector or other relevant sectors are welcome.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and
joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance
to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint
activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of
these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.
Applicants are encouraged to consider how their proposals can contribute in the context of the

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 4, notably “Ensuring access to innovative,
sustainable and high-quality healthcare”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim
for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following
expected outcomes:
• European countries and regions, along with international partners, are engaged in
enhanced collaborative research efforts for the development of innovative personalised
medicine approaches regarding prevention, diagnosis and treatment;
• Healthcare authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders develop evidence-based
strategies and policies for the uptake of personalised medicine in national or regional
healthcare systems;
• Health industries, policymakers and other stakeholders have access to efficient measures
and investments to allow swift transfer of research and innovation into market;
• Health industries and other stakeholders can accelerate the uptake of personalised
medicine through the adoption of innovative business models;
• Healthcare authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders use improved knowledge
and understanding of the health and costs benefits of personalised medicine to optimise
healthcare and make healthcare systems more sustainable;
• Healthcare providers and professionals improve health outcomes, prevent diseases and
maintain population health through the implementation of personalised medicine;
• Stronger and highly connected local/regional ecosystems of stakeholders, including
innovators, are in place and facilitate the uptake of successful innovations in
personalised medicine, thus improving healthcare outcomes and strengthening European
competitiveness;
• Citizens, patients and healthcare professionals have a better knowledge of personalised
medicine and are better involved in its implementation;
• Stakeholders cooperate better and establish a network of national and regional
knowledge hubs for personalised medicine.
Scope: Personalised medicine is a medical model using characterisation of individuals'
phenotypes and genotypes (e.g. molecular profiling, medical imaging and lifestyle data) for
tailoring the right health strategy. Personalised medicine shows great promise and has already
Part 4 - Page 154 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
led to ground-breaking developments in treatment of many diseases. Through this approach,
better health outcomes can be achieved by preventing disease and providing patient-centred
care tailored to the needs of citizens. There have been important investments in personalised
medicine over the last decades. However, producing knowledge, translating it into clinical
applications and accelerating innovation uptake are complex, time-consuming and involve
multiple stakeholders. There is a need to facilitate the uptake of health technology innovations
and ensure a rapid and effective implementation of personalised medicine on a larger scale in
Europe. To this end, the creation of a research and innovation (R&I) partnership with a focus
on personalised medicine represents a unique strategic opportunity to bring together
stakeholders, create synergies, coordinate R&I actions and leverage the efforts to accelerate
the evolution of healthcare toward personalised medicine.
The partnership should build on knowledge gained from supportive initiatives like the
International Consortium of Personalised Medicine (ICPerMed), the European Research Area
Network for Personalised Medicine (ERA-PerMed), several Coordination and Support
Actions (CSAs) funded by the EC under Horizon 2020, the one million genomes initiative as
well as with an increasing number of associated and related initiatives, research
infrastructures and capacities in Europe and beyond.
The partnership should facilitate exchange of information and good practices among
countries, provide robust guidance and tools, will network institutional stakeholders and
involve regional ecosystems. It should stimulate service, policy and organisational
innovations, as well as the integration of biomedical and technological innovations for the
benefit of the European citizens and the European industry. The partnership should bring
together a broad range of actors with a common vision of future personalised medicine.
Through the objectives of Horizon Europe, the partnership should contribute to achieving the
following European Commission priorities:
• Promoting our European way of life
• An economy that works for people
• A Europe fit for the digital age
• A European green deal
The partnership will also contribute to priorities of the “Communication on effective,
accessible and resilient health systems” (COM(2014) 215 final), the “Communication on
enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market;
empowering citizens and building a healthier society” (COM(2018) 233 final) and the
Europe's Beating Cancer Plan.
Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health
authorities, healthcare institutions, innovators, policymakers), to create a critical mass of
resources and to implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA),
the partnership should address the following objectives:
Part 4 - Page 155 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Putting Europe at the forefront of research and innovation through the support of
multidisciplinary actions open to international cooperation;
• Establishing a European national and regional network of research and innovation
systems dedicated to personalised medicine;
• Translating basic research into clinical applications that make a difference for patients,
their families and healthcare professionals;
• Filling scientific knowledge gaps, producing evidence and developing guidance and
tools in priority areas for the development and the deployment of personalised medicine;
• Integrating big data and digital health solutions in research and personalised healthcare;
• Strengthening the European healthcare industry and accelerating the uptake of
personalised medicine solutions;
• Developing appropriate ecosystems for the implementation of successful personalised
medicine approaches and a swift uptake of relevant innovations by healthcare systems;
• Providing socio-economic evidence of the feasibility of personalised medicine
approaches for its uptake by sustainable healthcare systems;
• Improving health outcomes for citizen and patients and ensuring a wide access to
advanced personalised medicine intervention approaches to all.
The European Partnership for Personalised Medicine261 is to be implemented through a joint
programme of activities ranging from research to coordination and networking activities,
including training, demonstration, piloting and dissemination activities, to be structured along
the following main building blocks:
• Joint implementation of the SRIA;
• Joint annual calls for R&I activities, applied R&I, pilots;
• Capacity building activities;
• Activities to enhance the skills of the relevant personalised medicine workforce, and
improve citizen relevant awareness and literacy;
• Deployment activities through pilots, innovation procurement and financial support
mechanisms,
• Flanking measures.
261 More information on the planned European Partnerships is available on the Horizon Europe Webpage.
Part 4 - Page 156 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
The Partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to
Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wanting to join. It should include the
following actors:
• Ministries in charge of R&I policy, as well as national and regional R&I and technology
funding agencies and foundations;
• Ministries in charge of health and care policy, as well as national and regional healthcare
authorities, organisations and providers.
The Partnership may also encourage engagement with other relevant Ministries and will
involve other key actors from civil society and end-users, research and innovation
community, innovation owners, healthcare systems owners/organisers and healthcare
agencies.
The Partnership’s governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective
management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and
uptake of the results. The governance should leave sufficient space for involving the key
stakeholders, including but not limited to R&I community, patients and citizens, healthcare
professionals, formal and informal care organisations, and innovation owners.
Financial commitments and in-kind contributions are expected to be provided for the
governance structure, the joint calls and other dedicated implementation actions and efforts
for national coordination.
To encourage national coordination and avoid an excess of grant signatories it is
recommended to limit their number to two per country. However, in duly justified cases this
number could differ, including for countries with decentralised administration to allow for
participation of regional authorities in charge of R&I policy and health and care policy.
To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and
investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with
other European partnerships and missions as set out in the working document on ‘Coherence
and Synergies of candidate European Partnerships under Horizon Europe’262 as well as to
explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. On top of
this, the proposal should consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to
EU4Health, DEP, ESF+, ERDF263, InvestEU, RRF and TSI.
The Partnership should align with EU-wide initiatives on open access and FAIR data264.

268 “Health and care systems” implies a broader notion than “health systems” or “healthcare systems”
notably encompassing all parts of health systems and health related parts of social care systems.

discrimination, such as migrants, Roma people, trans and intersex people, specific age and gender
groups (that intersects with other aspects of vulnerability, such as elderly women), indigenous people,
homeless people, people in poverty or at risk of poverty, people with disabilities or patients with
complex conditions.

Health
• Decision- and policymakers and providers have access to reliable quantitative data on
health inequalities in access to health and care services for people in vulnerable
situations.
• People in vulnerable situations are better equipped in terms of health and digital literacy,
knowledge about their rights etc. when it comes to access to health and care services.
• People in vulnerable situations are involved in the design and implementation of
research and innovation activities concerning access to health and care services.
Scope: Equal and needs-based access to health and care services are important values of the
EU, as well as central principles within the Member States (for example 2006 Council
Conclusions on Common values and principles in European Union Health Systems, European
Pillar of social rights). At the same time, plenty of evidence indicates that there is unmet need
for health and care services. Although financial barriers are an important part of the
explanation270, it is also evident that even in countries where co-payment is low or even zero,
access to health and care services differs between groups. Certain groups are more at risk of
not accessing all the health and care services they need, depending among other factors, on
their socio-economic and legal status, age, sex and gender identity, (dis)ability, ethnicity and
geographical location.
For example, the life expectancy for the Roma people – the largest ethnic minority in the EU
– is on average ten years shorter than the general population. This is because, due to poor
socio-economic conditions and ethnic segregation, many Roma people live in enclaves where
equal opportunities to services including infrastructure are lacking. Due to these inequalities
that are also rooted in antigypsysim271, Roma people are facing much greater difficulties
accessing and receiving standard health and care services including prevention compared to
other citizens272.
There are significant health inequalities between the LGBTIQ community and the population
as a whole. One part of the explanation is reluctance to seek health and care services because
they have experienced or fear hostile reactions. Trans- and intersex people still struggle to
access quality and affordable medication and care, both related to general health services and
specific health care relating to transition, such as a lack of relevant medication or surgical
procedures273.
Compared to men, older women have a higher poverty risk also due to lower pay and lower
pensions. They face a higher risk to live longer in poorer health, so their overall need for
270 See for example OECD Health at a glance 2021.
271 Antigypsyism (a form of racism against Roma people) is a historically rooted structural phenomenon
that appears at institutional, social and interpersonal levels.
272 The EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation sets up the ambitious goal
to lessen the life expectancy gap and ensure that by 2030 Roma women and men live 5 years longer.
https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/eu_roma_strategic_framework_for_equality_inclusion_and_
participation_for_2020_-_2030_0.pdf
273 stateofart_report_en.pdf (europa.eu) The Commission’s Health4LGBTI project concluded that trans and
intersex-focused research is needed that addresses health inequalities and healthcare.
Part 4 - Page 161 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
health and especially care services is therefore higher. People living in difficult socio-
economic situations, such as homeless people or people at the risk of poverty may experience
similar issues. For migrants and refugees, uncertain legal status, fear of public authorities, or
language difficulties may cause additional barriers to seeking adequate health and care
services.
Whilst factors outside the health and care sector also have an impact on people’s access to
health and care services, health and care systems can influence and facilitate access through
accessibility, costs, referrals and attitudes.
Another aspect concerns access to data regarding certain groups. Whereas data on access to
health and care when it comes to factors related to socio-economic characteristics,
geographical barriers, sex, and age is more accessible, data on people in vulnerable situations
(often due to the problem of sensitivity of data) is often less accessible, contributing to
making the situation of these groups less visible.
Activities under this call should focus on groups that are in vulnerable situations from a
social, financial or health perspective, or at risk of discrimination, such as migrants, Roma
people, trans and intersex people, specific age and gender groups (that intersects with other
aspects of vulnerability, such as elderly women), indigenous people, homeless people, people
in poverty or at risk of poverty, people with disabilities or patients with complex conditions.
Where relevant, activities should use intersectional approaches to consider, inter alia,
socioeconomic factors, geography, citizenship, age, sex and gender identity, and ethnicity.
Next to the above-mentioned, research and innovation activities under this topic should
address several of the following:
• Different types of barriers - different barriers to study could be financial, geographic,
social, marginalisation and discrimination. When relevant, health and digital literacy
aspects should be analysed. The selection of factors should be context specific as groups
suffering from access barriers vary a lot across EU countries and at subnational level.
The principle of needs-based health and care should be taken into account.
• Access to what? – for example: what part of the health and care system (from
prevention, primary care and long-term care to tertiary care, any specific services, e.g.
mental care) do different groups have access to? Is integrated care provided for these
groups taking into account their particular needs? How much health and care services do
different groups access?
• Solutions - What measures are needed to counter inequalities in health and care access
and make sure that vulnerable groups access health and care services and that access is
based on needs (measures to educate, support and empower vulnerable groups can be
included here)? What are the costs, at different levels, to develop these solutions?
Piloting of measures could be included. Community-based and/or co-created initiatives
and peer-support approaches: what works and how can these be supported, sustained
and/or integrated in the wider service landscape.
Part 4 - Page 162 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Better data – improving access and quality of data will contribute to identify people in
vulnerable situations’ health needs and implement targeted measures corresponding to
the challenges that each group experiences. The data could for example explore
effectiveness of provided care (metrics helping to assess if provided care addresses the
root causes of inequalities) or new valid methodologies to identify the unmet health
related needs of people in vulnerable situations. Quantitative and qualitative data on
inequalities in prevention, prevalence and treatment of different morbidities.
• Cost analyses - The cost of inequalities in access to health and care services:
Quantitatively and/or qualitatively measure the negative impact on not taking measures
for helping people in vulnerable situations have access to health and care services
including prevention.
Proposals are expected to involve the people/groups studied in the design and implementation
of the research and innovation activities and where relevant service providers and other
stakeholders.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and
joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance
to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint
activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of
these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.
When relevant, funded actions should build on the work done by the European Joint Action
on Health Equity Europe (JAHEE) and the upcoming activities under the EU4Health
Programme (Direct grants to international organisations (WHO): supporting Member States in
improving access to healthcare and effectiveness of health coverage, taking into account
vulnerabilities of specific groups and targeted intervention and access to mental health for
people in vulnerable situations).
Also, when relevant, projects should build on, and are encouraged to consider how their
proposals can contribute to, the Commission’s LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020-2025, the EU
Strategy for the rights of persons living with disabilities, EU strategy on the rights of the child
the Child Guarantee, the Gender Equality Strategy, the EU Roma Strategic Framework and
the EU Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030274.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 4 “Ensuring access to innovative,
sustainable and high-quality health care”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim
for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing, to some of the
following expected outcomes:
• Public procurers, possibly in cooperation with private ones, in the area of health and care
stimulate the competitive development of market-ready, environmentally sustainable
innovative solutions (materials, technologies and systems/practices). These solutions
take into consideration the green deal ambitions on zero pollution, climate neutrality and
circular economy, while increasing the overall sustainability of the sector.
• Procurers open up opportunities for European health and technology industry actors
(including start-ups/SMEs) to bring to the market innovations that are cost-efficient, safe
and proven to increase environmental sustainability while improving or at least
maintaining health outcomes and access to care for patients.
• Procurers facilitate the commercialisation of environmentally sustainable innovative
solutions by their successful suppliers through providing them with first customer
references for the validation and first pilot deployment.
• Policymakers, health care providers and professionals, patients and carers – each in their
respective areas – exchange and adopt good practices and the best solutions and
technologies that the market can deliver to reduce carbon emissions and minimise waste
and pollution stemming from health and care provision, in line with the Green Deal
ambitions.
Scope: The healthcare sector is responsible for 4-5% of global total carbon emissions277
contributing significantly to Europe's carbon footprint and to the generation of large amounts
of plastics and other waste, including chemical waste through the discharge of
pharmaceuticals and diagnostic chemicals as well as disinfectants and antimicrobial resistant
pathogens into the wastewater system. Good hygiene and safety are vital in this setting
however innovative solutions can help to reduce the environmental impact of the healthcare

Health
sector through the efficient use of resources, increasing circularity, and the introduction of
“greener” materials, technologies and practices.
Up to now the healthcare sector has not significantly embraced the green transition. However,
pressure is increasing as demonstrated by the launch of the first ever Declaration on Climate
and Health278 by the UAE COP28 presidency. The declaration calls for action and joint vision
on ensuring better health outcomes, in part through the transformation of health and care
systems to become climate-resilient, low-carbon, sustainable, circular and equitable. Such a
transformation will contribute in the long term to improving patient care by enhancing both
the sustainability and overall efficiency of health and care systems.
Pre-commercial procurement (PCP) actions target consortia of procurers with similar needs
that want to procure together the development of innovative solutions for greening the health
and care systems. This topic does not provide direct funding to developers, industry or
research organisations to perform R&D. They will be able to respond to the call for tenders
launched by consortia of procurers funded under this call. Specific guidance on PCP actions
and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annexes H of the Horizon
Europe work programme.
As every step in health and care delivery has a role in reducing its environmental footprint,
the topic can support any of the different dimensions and needs for the greening of the
healthcare sector.
Proposals should target either:
• Direct and indirect footprint deriving from the provision and/or delivery of care
(excluding infrastructural elements related to building, transport logistics and food
footprints).
• Circularity, waste production and treatment.
• Footprint from the chain of suppliers in making and delivering products, or services.
• More efficient use of resources, decreasing the overall sector footprint while addressing
the constantly increasing demand for healthcare.
Focus should be on solutions that are specific to the healthcare sector therefore proposals
targeting general infrastructure (energy efficiency of buildings such cooling, heating and
ventilation, vehicles, construction or refurbishment), energy supply or food and catering
services do not fall within scope. Within this topic, it is possible to foresee the transfer and
adaptation of solutions and/or interventions from other sectors to health and care systems. It is
open both to proposals requiring improvements mainly based on one specific
solution/technology field, as well as to proposals requiring end-to-end solutions that need
combinations of different types of innovation.

Part 4 - Page 167 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
Continuous dialogue between demand and supply side is required for the success of PCPs,
therefore the effective involvement of end users (e.g. clinical teams, patients or hospital
structures etc) needs to be considered in the proposal. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with
the supply side, procurers are required to organise an open market consultation before
launching the procurement and to promote the call for tenders widely across Europe to
potentially interested suppliers.
Involvement of procurement decision makers is needed to ensure that end solution(s) are
adopted by health and care systems increasing the societal impact of the related research
activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to purchase at least
one solution resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate
whether they will (1) procure the solution(s) as part of the PCP or (2) in a separate follow-up
procurement after the PCP. In the first case, procurers can implement the project as a fast-
track PCP (see general annex H) and foresee the budget to purchase at least one solution
during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers must include in the proposal a deliverable
that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase successful solution(s) after the PCP.

Destination 5. Unlocking the full potential of new tools, technologies and
digital solutions for a healthy society
Calls for proposals under this destination are directed towards the Key Strategic Orientation
KSO-A ‘Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of key digital,
enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains’ of Horizon Europe’s Strategic
Plan 2021-2024. Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute
to the impact area ‘High quality digital services for all’ and in particular to the following
expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: ‘Health technologies, new
tools and digital solutions are applied effectively thanks to their inclusive, secure and ethical
development, delivery, integration and deployment in health policies and health and care
systems’. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also
contribute to the following impact areas: ‘A competitive and secure data-economy’,
‘Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people’, and ‘Good
health and high-quality accessible health care’.
Technology is a key driver for innovation in the health care sector. It can provide better and
more cost-efficient solutions with high societal impact, tailored to the specific health care
needs of the individual. However, novel tools, therapies, technologies and digital approaches
face specific barriers and hurdles in piloting, implementing and scaling-up before reaching the
patient, encountering additional challenges such as public acceptance and trust. Emerging and
disruptive technologies offer big opportunities for transforming health care, thereby
promoting the health and well-being of citizens. Unlocking this potential and harnessing the
opportunities depends on the capacity to collect, integrate and interpret large amounts of data,
as well as ensure compatibility with appropriate regulatory frameworks and infrastructures
that will both safeguard the rights of the individual and of society and stimulate innovation to
develop impactful solutions. In addition to existing European Research Infrastructures, the
European Health Data Space will promote health-data exchange and facilitate cross-border
research activities. Moreover, the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response
Authority (HERA) aims to improve to improve the EU's readiness for health emergencies by
supporting research, innovation and development of technologies and medical
countermeasures needed against potential cross-border health threats. This destination aims to
promote the development of tools, technologies and digital solutions for treatments,
medicines, medical devices and improved health outcomes, taking into consideration safety,
effectiveness, appropriateness, accessibility, comparative value-added and fiscal sustainability
as well as issues of ethical, legal and regulatory nature.
In this work programme destination 5 has a strong focus on the personalisation of health
technologies and will address the following issues:
Developing computational systems for point-of-care applications, developing and validating
computational models of physiological systems and integrating health data from different
sources, for better patient management and improved clinical outcomes;
Part 4 - Page 169 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
Fostering translational biomedical research and advancing regenerative medicine approaches
into clinical settings and manufacturing;
Preparing for potential cross-border health threats through the development of innovative in-
vitro-diagnostics;
Supporting the establishment of the European Health Data Space by designing a data quality
label.
In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European
Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable
cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities
such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and
adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential
synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects
funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing
projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to
European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic
challenges on health, the European Innovation Ecosystems (EIE) interregional networks on
health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe) or in areas cutting across the
health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe), like, for instance, with cluster 4
“Digital, Industry and Space” on digitalisation of the health sector or key enabling
technologies.
Expected Impacts
Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway towards
unlocking the full potential of new tools, technologies and digital solutions for a healthy
society, and more specifically to several of the following expected impacts:
• Europe’s scientific and technological expertise and know-how, its capabilities for
innovation in new tools, technologies and digital solutions, and its ability to take-up,
scale-up and integrate innovation in health care is world-class.
• Citizens benefit from targeted and faster research resulting in safer, more sustainable,
efficient, cost-effective and affordable tools, technologies and digital solutions for
improved (personalised) disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring for
better patient outcome and well-being, in particular through increasingly shared health
resources (interoperable data, infrastructure, expertise, citizen/patient driven co-
creation)279.
• The EU gains high visibility and leadership in terms of health technology development,
including through international cooperation.

• The burden of diseases in the EU and worldwide is reduced through the development
and integration of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, personalised
medicine approaches, digital and other people-centred solutions for health care.
• Both the productivity of health research and innovation, and the quality and outcome of
health care is improved thanks to the use of health data and innovative analytical tools,
such as artificial intelligence (AI) supported decision-making, in a secure and ethical
manner, respecting individual integrity and underpinned with public acceptance and
trust.
• Citizens trust and support the opportunities offered by innovative technologies for health
care, based on expected health outcomes and potential risks involved.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 5 “Unlocking the full potential of new tools,
technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society”. To that end, proposals under this
topic should aim for delivering results that are directed towards and contributing to several of
the following Expected Outcomes:
• Healthcare providers increase their knowledge on the potential of combined ATMPs and
get access to innovative treatment options with demonstrated health benefits for unmet
medical needs;
• Developers and manufacturers of combined ATMPs obtain scientific evidence on the
proposed therapeutic approach;
• Patients benefit from new advanced therapies delivered through the combined ATMPs;
• EU companies get a better market position in the field of combined ATMPs.
Scope: The subjects of this topic are combined ATMPs (Advanced Therapy Medicinal
Products) according to the definition of the ATMP-regulation (EU 1394/2007, Article 2d).
Such combined ATMPs are composed of an ATMP and one or more medical devices or one
or more active implantable medical devices, and their cellular or tissue part must either
contain viable cells or tissues, or non-viable cells or tissues liable for exerting the primary
action on the human body.
The combined ATMPs should be more effective than current state-of-the-art solutions on the
European market owing to improved features like personalisation, accuracy, reliability and

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 5 “Unlocking the full potential of new tools,
technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society”. To that end, proposals under this
topic should aim for delivering results that are directed towards and contributing to several of
the following expected outcomes:
• Clinicians and other healthcare professionals have access to and/or use validated multi-
scale computational models of individual patients for delivering optimised and cost-
effective patient management strategies superior to the current standard of care.
• Healthcare professionals benefit from enhanced knowledge of complex disease onset and
progression by recourse to validated, multi-scale and multi-organ models.
• Clinicians and patients benefit from new, improved personalised diagnostics, medicinal
products, devices, and therapeutic strategies tailored to the individual patient patho-
physiology.
• Citizens and patients have access to validated ‘virtual twin’ models enabling the
integration of citizen-generated data with medical and other longitudinal health data, and
benefit from early detection of disease onset, prediction of disease progression and
treatment options, and effective disease management.
Scope: This topic will contribute to the consolidation of existing virtual twin models and
support research to move towards a more integrated human virtual twin, with the aim to
accelerate translational research towards cost-effective development of new health
technologies. Furthermore, ‘virtual twin’ patient models hold the potential of transforming
clinical processes and healthcare with longitudinal monitoring, making personalised medicine,
disease prevention and individualised patient management a reality.
Proposals are expected to contribute to the virtual human twin roadmap and ecosystem
supported under the Digital Europe Programme288, with models aligned and interoperable
with those linked to the repository developed thereunder.
The proposals should address all of the following activities:
• Develop multi-scale and multi-organ, dynamic, interoperable, modular computational
models, capable of accurately simulating the individual patient patho-physiology,
spanning different anatomical scales, from the molecular to cell, tissue, organ and
systems level, as necessary. Proposals should be multidisciplinary and focus on groups
of communicable and/or non-communicable diseases with commonalities within the
same or across different medical domains, including co-morbidities. SME(s)
participation is encouraged with the aim to strengthen the scientific and technological
basis of SME(s) and valorise their innovations towards citizen and patient benefit.

• Advance the state of the art in multi-scale modelling by employing diverse modelling
methodologies, including but not limited to: mechanistic modelling, artificial
intelligence, agent-based and network physiology as a means for modelling the healthy
state, disease onset, progression, treatment and recovery. Availability of the necessary
diverse data types (e.g. data from lab tests, medical imaging, wearables, sensors, medical
check-ups, mHealth devices, longitudinal health monitoring etc.) should be demonstrated
and the sex/gender dimension should be investigated.
• Integrate standardised spatiotemporal multi-scale models as a basis for developing
personalised ‘virtual twin’ models taking account of patient individual characteristics,
medical and health status history for advancing personalised disease management.
Proposals should ensure that the development of ‘virtual twin’ models is driven by the
end-users/citizens/healthcare professionals needs and their active involvement
throughout the development process. Furthermore, applicants should utilise appropriate
IT solutions for model visualisation and demonstrate their accessibility and usability for
clinical uptake.
• Validate multi-scale patient-specific models and generate evidence that results can
deliver clinically meaningful, real-world observations for the human diseases under
study. Applicants should implement proof-of-concept, feasibility studies in relevant end
user environments and/or real-world settings, and collect evidence of utility vis-à-vis
current clinical practice. Dynamic ‘virtual twin’ models and simulations as clinical
decision support tools will need be shown to improve prognosis, medical diagnosis,
treatments and health outcomes across the continuum of diseases evolution, including
co-morbidities and long-term care as appropriate. An exploitation strategy and a business
plan, including regulatory and industrial input, should be developed for accelerating
clinical and/or market uptake.
The proposals should adhere to the FAIR data289 principles and adopt data quality standards,
GDPR-compliant data sharing, access and data integration procedures based on good
practices developed by the European research infrastructures. In relation to the use and
interpretation of data, special attention should be paid to systematically assess for bias and/or
discrimination (sex/gender, ethnic, minority and vulnerable groups aspects). Proposals are
invited to consider adopting recommendations for in-silico models construction and
validation.290

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 5 “Unlocking the full potential of new tools,
technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society”. To that end, proposals under this
topic should aim for delivering results that are directed towards and contributing to most of
the following expected outcomes:
• Researchers, innovators and healthcare professionals benefit from better linkage of
health data from various sources, including genomics, based on harmonised approaches
related to data structure, format and quality, applicable across certain disease areas and
across national borders.
• Researchers, innovators, healthcare professionals and health policymakers have access to
advanced digital tools for the integration, management and analysis of various health
data re-used in a secure, cost-effective and clinically meaningful way enabling the
improvement of health outcomes.
• By linking and using effectively more data and new methods and tools, including
artificial intelligence, researchers, innovators and healthcare professionals are able to
advance our understanding of the risk factors, causes, development and optimal
treatment in disease areas where genomics integrated with other health data, spanning
from clinical to e.g. lifestyle, offer potential for novel and more comprehensive
information.
• Healthcare professionals and health policymakers benefit from data-driven solutions and
reinforced evidence base for decisions addressing health and care challenges.
• Citizens can be offered data-driven patient-focused health interventions, resulting in
improved disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring towards better patient
outcomes and well-being.
• Citizens’ trust in the sharing and re-use of health data for research and healthcare
increases due to the application of advanced technologies and data governance
preserving data privacy and security.
Scope: Health data bear vast information potential in many disease areas, to significantly
improve the outcomes and efficiency of healthcare delivery, unlock new research and
innovation avenues, and inform public health policy across Europe. There is a huge need of
integration, use and deployment of health data from multiple sources for effectively
addressing the challenges of medical research underpinning diagnostics, therapy guidance and
implementation decisions on new therapies. Such integration requires linking data of different
types, disease areas and provenance which are scattered in repositories and databases across
Europe.
This topic aims to support proposals focusing on the integration of health data from multiple
sources (e.g. electronic health records, genomics, medical imaging, laboratory and diagnostic
results, pathogen data, public health registries and other clinical research data) by linking real-

Health
world and clinical research data. The data integration should be exemplified in several use-
cases, i.e. well-justified groups of diseases (excluding cancer), within and/or across medical
domains, and pave the way towards improved health outcomes. At least one of those use cases
should build on the use of whole genome sequence data.
The consortium should ensure wide coverage of EU and associated countries, contributing
significantly to health data standardisation, while catering for the diversity of health data
sources.
To enhance synergies and avoid overlaps of activities, the proposals are expected to align with
and complement the relevant European initiatives, in particular the European Health Data
Space (EHDS), the 1+Million Genomes initiative (1+MG) and the European Open Science
Cloud.
The applicants have to demonstrate that the necessary data sources are, or will be, effectively,
timely and legally available for the proposed research activities.
The proposals should address all of the following activities:
• Identification of the barriers to health data integration and access as needed for the
selected use cases, and of specific existing tools, technological solutions and
coordination and standardisation agreements addressing those barriers. Issues to be
covered include semantic ontologies, data standards and formats, data quality, data
storage, management and access modalities, as well as enhanced findability of relevant
datasets through improved metadata standards and data catalogues.
• New approaches to assemble large, easily findable and lawfully accessible high-quality
datasets integrating multiple types of health data leading to improved clinical outcomes
(e.g. new care solutions, personalised disease management, advanced diagnostic tools),
taking into account data FAIRification291 and inter-operability needs.
• New techniques, support tools, mechanisms and modalities to enable GDPR compliant
access to sensitive personal data, including genomics, allowing for their re-use across
borders and integration of different types of data relevant to human health. Legal and
ethical frameworks should duly consider the heterogeneity in national and sectorial rules
and procedures for data access and re-use.
• Data management approaches for cross-border distributed data storage and processing,
enabling remote collaboration, electronic consent management, data provenance
tracking, and scalability of data management resources, ensuring data privacy and
security, and resulting in robust support to advanced, innovative clinical workflows.
Joint data governance is expected to be piloted among several clinical centres across
Europe.

• Development of a data analytics platform applying distributed learning and artificial
intelligence approaches to query and aggregate efficiently, effectively and securely data
from multiple sources for multiple use cases (groups of diseases), to monitor patients'
health status, analyse causal inference, support diagnosis and health policymakers, and
establish recommendations for patients and other stakeholders.
The proposals should adhere to the FAIR data292 principles and build on existing and justified
tools and harmonisation efforts, such as widely used standards for encoding the different
types of health data and inter-operability for cross-sector collaborations. Also the data
collection, management and/or modelling should build on ongoing EU and international
efforts to avoid possible duplication of efforts and fragmentation. In particular, projects are
expected to take into account the legislation, if available, on the EHDS, so as to align project
activities with pertinent EHDS infrastructure efforts that provide for the secondary use of
health data as regards e.g. cross-border access to data, cross-border infrastructures, data
quality and utility labelling. The achievements of the relevant past and ongoing EU-funded
projects and initiatives, and good practices developed by the European research
infrastructures, should be duly considered and used. Close involvement of patients and end-
users is crucial to ensure that the project outcomes are relevant, widely accepted and feasible
in real-world settings.
The tools developed by the projects are expected to be widely accessible and amenable to
necessary updates after the project’s end for further use by interested parties. Datasets
generated during the project should be accessible to researchers and innovators. For example,
genomic data and linked patient level data are expected to be made accessible for secondary
use through the 1+MG data infrastructure.

techniques, to enable continuous monitoring and/or fast real-time health status checks in
clinical settings and workflows.
• Patients and clinicians benefit from wider access to real-time diagnosis, screening,
monitoring and treatments using novel imaging and/or robotics systems and/or Point-of-
Care devices that are seamlessly integrated in care environments and workflows.
• Quicker reaction times and improved patient safety in care settings.
• Researchers and healthcare professionals have more opportunities to use, extract value
from and contribute to the uptake of real-time health data and/or Point-of-Care
computing; existing technologies and methods are expected to progress from their
current technology readiness levels (TRL), from TRL 3-4 to at least TRL 7293.
• Health and care settings benefit from reduced energy consumption of Point-of-Care
tools, devices and systems, and/or data analysis.
Scope: The proposals are expected to develop and test innovative tools, devices and systems
for point-of-care applications, including but not limited to robotics, photonics, bio-sensing,
artificial intelligence etc. These would provide clinicians with real-time imaging, data analysis
and interactive visual presentation for understanding and diagnosing diseases, facilitating risk-
assessment, prevention, and carrying out medical interventions with improved patient safety.
The proposals should demonstrate advancement and integration of technologies from proof-
of-concept to prototype demonstration in operational environment. Devices and systems
should be designed, developed and tested vis-à-vis defined use cases, based on the appropriate
involvement of clinicians and other stakeholders, ensuring they can be seamlessly integrated
into existing digital infrastructures and clinical workflows. The use cases in care settings
could include but are not limited to surgery workflows, Intensive Care Unit workflows and
integration of remote patient monitoring into clinical workflows. Data quality, integration and
interoperability, as well as issues of cybersecurity and data protection have to be addressed.
Design should take gender specificities into account. Clinical studies should be an integral
part of the work proposed, with developmental iteration steps and consultation of regulators
included as appropriate. Establishing synergies with AI Testing and Experimentation
Facilities, European Digital Innovation Hubs and other similar initiatives is encouraged.
Proposals must include a short description of initial business plan as part of the exploitation

modalities or the combination of different imaging modalities should be made
compatible with other imaging tools and with state-of-the-art and/or novel medical
technologies and devices, for example those used to remove tissues in precision surgery
(e.g. robotic surgery).
• Advancements in the use of Point-of-Care computing, data modelling, extended reality
and/or machine learning/AI technologies applied to diagnosis and risk assessment in
cases requiring very fast, near to real-time response times in clinical settings and
workflows. In addition, projects should showcase how distributed systems bringing
computation and storage physically close to where data is generated and used can most
effectively deliver actionable outputs for person-centred health care, contributing to
improved patient safety, in the areas of for example healthy living support, remote
patient monitoring, surgery workflows or acute care.

availability of diagnostics that can contribute to detecting and characterising health threats.
Proposals should develop and advance on new in vitro diagnostics relevant for detecting and
characterising cross-border health threats and develop novel approaches to the development of
medical countermeasures targeting threats identified by HERA295.
Proposals should cover pathogens with pandemic potential in humans or other health threats,
such as chemical, radiological and nuclear threats for which there are no existing diagnostics
or where clinical practice could benefit from innovation. Emphasis should be put on the
development of new diagnostics, innovative catch-all methodologies, or on the improvement
of existing health technologies advancing diagnostics and characterisation of health threats,
applying the One Health approach when relevant.
Proposals should aim to diversify and accelerate the global diagnostic research and
development pipeline to tackle cross-border health threats, and to strengthen the current
leading role of the EU in research and development, and therefore contributing to the work of
the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).
Attention should be paid to critical social factors such as sex, gender, age, socio-economic
factors, ethnicity/migration, and disability.
Proposals should include a clear regulatory path to market in order to ensure future
compliance with the legal requirements. Proposals should address several of the following
areas:
• Proof-of-concept/early studies linked e.g. to performance evaluation of new diagnostics
that facilitate screening, detection of the presence or exposure to a cross-border health
threat or determination of infectious/disease status through human samples, included but
not limited to the list of high impact health threats identified by HERA, as well
chemical, radiological and nuclear threats for which there is a lack of in vitro diagnostics
or existing diagnostics have a sub-optimal performance.
• Data-driven diagnostic and prognostic platforms with AI and other advanced data
analytics functionalities, adaptable to respond to new and multiple pathogens/threats, e.g.
covering prototype viruses.
• Innovative systems linked to high sensitivity/specificity profiles adaptable for broader
use should be considered, such as portable, faster, more compact or accurate devices and
technologies, including the possibility to develop point of care or self-tests.
• Innovative diagnostics sampling methods or samples bringing a significant
improvement, such as less invasive sampling methods.

Health
topic should aim to deliver results that are directed towards and contributing to all of the
following expected outcomes:
• Data Users (researchers, innovators, regulators, policymakers, clinicians) are able to
identify the most relevant datasets that meet their specific needs through a label
describing accurately and in a standard way the quality and utility dimensions of the
datasets, as proposed in the legal provisions of the European Health Data Space (EHDS).
• Data holders have clear specifications for dataset quality and utility labelling to comply
with the requirements proposed in the EHDS legal provisions. In addition to that, data
holders have access to a maturity model with the requirements a dataset needs to fulfil to
achieve higher levels of data quality and utility.
• European and National public funders ensure that the datasets, for which they provided
funding for the creation and curation of, are more widely available, furthering their reuse
for secondary uses as proposed in the EHDS legal provisions (research, innovation,
regulatory work, policymaking, personalised medicine).
• The European Commission has access to a set of specifications for the data quality and
utility label supporting the implementation of the EHDS legal provisions.
Scope: A vast quantity of health datasets exist across Europe, from multiple sources
(individual care, medical registries, social, environmental behavioural, wellbeing, clinical
trials, research, administrative, etc.), and of varying quality. This represents a tremendous
opportunity for the reuse of this data for purposes other than for the one for which they were
originally collected and spur the development of better prevention strategies, diagnoses,
treatments and care plans.
The European Health Data Space (EHDS) will provide a common EU framework for
secondary use of health data such as research, innovation, regulatory purposes, policymaking
and personalised medicine. It will enable data users to have access to large amounts of health
data through health data access bodies empowered with the EHDS legal provisions to
overcome existing limitations regarding the processing of health data for secondary uses.
To support data users in the discovery and selection of datasets for their purposes, there is a
growing need to develop a data quality and utility framework to articulate the characteristics
and the potential usefulness of datasets. This framework will also support data holders in
identifying and addressing areas of improvement which can, in turn, allow for wider and
better use of these datasets.
Several initiatives have developed or are developing guidelines and recommendations for
health data quality, however, these typically focus on specific data types (i.e. 1+ Million
Genome Initiative296) or areas of applications (i.e. European Medicines Agency – EMA and
Heads of Medicines Agencies’ Big Data Steering Group activities to support medicines
296 https://b1mg-project.eu/work-packages/wp3
Part 4 - Page 188 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
regulation297). Similarly, previous studies and initiatives have addressed specific dimensions
of ‘data quality’ for health data but none are offering a framework suitable for the breadth of
data types and encompassing the quality and utility elements proposed in the EHDS legal
provisions. The proposed framework should take into account the various needs of data users
whilst at the same time avoid becoming an excessive burden on data holders which will need
to produce the data quality and utility label.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:
• Perform a mapping of existing data quality and utility principles/initiatives/frameworks
(i.e. EMA/HMA Big Data Stakeholders Group Data quality efforts, TEHDAS Data
Quality Working Group298, EOSC-LIFE299 Health Data Research UK’s data quality and
utility framework300, and relevant data principles, resources and tools (FAIR, FAIR
Cookbook, etc.)301;
• Conduct various stakeholder consultations, integrating all relevant data users and data
holders of health data, EHDS Health Data Access Bodies (HDABs) and other relevant
actors to validate data user needs and adequately take into account relevant initiatives
when developing the proposed framework;
• Develop a framework (set of technical specifications) for the data quality and utility
label that supports the implementation of the EHDS legal provisions and the roll out of
the label by the data holders and EHDS Health Data Access Bodies;
• Pilot and evaluate the use of the proposed framework (as a label and as a maturity
model) on a datasets sample representing the wide-ranging data types (such as electronic
health records, genomics datasets, medical registries, administrative data, etc.) and
taking into account the needs of all data users identified.
• Develop recommendations for the successful implementation and adoption of the data
quality and utility label and maturity model across European Member States considering
the maturity levels regarding secondary of health data.
The consortium should be composed of representatives from data users, data holders, health
data access bodies, and other relevant stakeholders to the scope of secondary use of health
data, adequately covering the diversity of heath data types and users’ needs across European
Member States.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 5 “Unlocking the full potential of new tools,
technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society”. To that end, proposals under this
topic should aim for delivering results that are directed towards and contributing to several of
the following Expected Outcomes:
• Researchers utilise tools and strategies that are more relevant to the human situation as
compared to the currently used animal models.
• Fewer live animals are used in biomedical research.
• Health technology developers will get access to improved human-relevant tools or
strategies allowing for a faster pace of innovation.
• Legislators and regulators will benefit from strengthened EU leadership in non-animal
based biomedical research that is socially accepted and sustainable.
• Healthcare providers and patients will benefit from innovative tools or strategies opening
up novel biomedical concepts enabling improved disease prediction, prevention and
treatment.
Scope: The proposal(s) should develop and/or use tools and strategies that address critical
areas of biomedical research where animal-models are currently used but are of limited
translational value for investigation and development of prevention and treatment. Such
advanced tools and strategies should aim at a better understanding of the pathogenesis of
disorders that feature a high impact on public health and exhibit a high rate of animal use or
severe animal suffering, and enable to develop biomedical concepts with increased
translational value, thereby ultimately leading to improved disease prediction, prevention and
treatment.
The proposals should address all of the following aspects:

• The innovative tools and strategies should include a variety of technologies and
methodological approaches such as –omics and other high-throughput procedures,
human-derived cell-based material, organoids, micro-physiological systems, and in-
silico models.
• The newly proposed tools and strategies should demonstrably advance the state-of-the-
art in specific areas of biomedical research.
• Prospects and avenues for dissemination, knowledge sharing, uptake or translation into
health policies of the proposed tools and strategies within the EU should be provided.
• Aspects such as harm and cost-benefit assessment as well as ease of production with
respect to current practices should also be considered.
• Criteria for model qualification and standardisation should be developed in well-justified
use-case contexts to demonstrate their translational values.
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research
Centre (JRC) to provide added-value regarding such aspects as supporting validation of
emerging approaches, promotion of research results, and the interfacing with the regulatory
community. In this respect, the JRC is open to collaborate with any successful proposal after
the selection process has been completed.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and
joint activities. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the
participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption
of best practices, or joint communication activities. Therefore, proposals are expected to
include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the
costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint
activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant
agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of
facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH)
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the
societal impact of the related research activities.
Applicants invited to the second stage and envisaging to include clinical studies should

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 5 “Unlocking the full potential of new tools,
technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society”. To that end, proposals under this
topic should aim for delivering results that are directed towards and contributing to several of
the following expected Outcomes:
• Biomedical scientists will access entire bio-printing units for regenerating human tissue.
• Availability of larger-scale bio-printed tissues for biomedical research purposes to both
industry and academia.
• Healthcare professionals acquire information on the safe and effective use of advanced
therapies.
• Healthcare providers dispose of tools enabling them to treat conditions of unmet medical
need.
Part 4 - Page 195 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Individual patients will benefit from a personalised approach to their respective medical
condition thanks to the bio-printed regenerative medicine solution.
Scope: Regenerative medicine is a branch of translational research in tissue engineering and
molecular biology which deals with the "process of replacing, engineering or regenerating
human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function". 3D-printing in general
is considered an advanced manufacturing technique and 3D-printing of non-viable
biomaterials to serve e.g. as scaffold for cell growth or as structure for medical devices is
already broadly used.
However, bio-printing technology involving living cells is still in early stages of development,
but has a huge potential for tissue engineering, drug testing and other biomedical applications.
Tissue-specific functional 3D bio-printing is a new approach for transplantation applications
in regenerative medicine, relying on the fabrication of tissues and organs with respect to the
desired shape and function and their delivery and application in vivo. “In-situ bio-printing”
known as printing cells and biomaterials directly onto or in a patient, or 4D bio-printing,
which introduces a “time” variable that allows 3D printed materials to change shape or
function when external stimulus is applied, are recent developments facing multiple additional
challenges.
Despite some success of 3D bio-printing with thin tissue, thick tissue and complex organs
remain a bottleneck because it is difficult to sufficiently mimic their metabolic needs, and the
scientific knowledge about their intimate architecture and interplay with other tissues are not
sufficiently elucidated. Next to these limitations are a lack of standardised manufacturing
protocols and standardised bio-ink formulations with tuneable properties, unstable cellular
behaviour, material biocompatibility and printability, etc. Taken together, 3D bio-printing is
confronted with several challenges that currently hamper its large-scale deployment.
To overcome these challenges, researchers should work in multidisciplinary teams with
engineers, biomedical scientists, cell biologists and medical doctors and proposals should
address most of the following activities:
• Design the best bio-printing strategy for at least one type of tissue thanks to a better
understanding of the interconnections of the different cell types inside the chosen tissue
or organ
• Develop or improve existing equipment able to print bio-constructs with higher
resolution in a shorter time using various biomaterials and different cell types
• Cover all steps of the bio-printing suite, including cell collection, cell differentiation and
expansion, imaging, modelling, bio-ink formulation, actual bio-printing, nutrient supply,
process monitoring and cell-construct delivery at target site
• Scale-up the chosen bio-printing technology to a GMP-conform manufacturing process
• Combine different bio-printing technologies in order to obtain fully functional synthetic
constructs of complex tissues or organs.

Health
Regulatory knowledge of the field is desired and should be documented through contacts with
relevant national or international European regulatory authorities.
The chosen medical area (tissue, organ, condition) should be duly justified. Sex differences at
the cellular level should be taken into consideration.
Preclinical stage and early clinical development are eligible. The involvement of SMEs is
encouraged.

Destination 6. Maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally
competitive health industry
Calls for proposals under this destination are directed towards the Key Strategic Orientation
KSO-A ‘Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of key digital,
enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains’ of Horizon Europe’s Strategic
Plan 2021-2024. Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute
to the impact area ‘A competitive and secure data-economy’ and in particular to the following
expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: ‘EU health industry is
innovative, sustainable and globally competitive thanks to improved up-take of breakthrough
technologies and innovations, which makes the EU with its Member States more resilient and
less dependent from imports with regard to the access to and supply of critical health
technologies’. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also
contribute to the following impact areas: ‘Industrial leadership in key and emerging
technologies that work for people’, ‘High quality digital services for all’, and ‘Good health
and high-quality accessible health care’.
The health industry is a key driver for growth and has the capacity to provide health
technologies to the benefit of patients and providers of health care services. The relevant
value chains involve a broad variety of key players from supply, demand and regulatory sides.
In addition, the path of innovation in health is long and complex. The development of novel
health technologies is generally associated with uncertainties and market barriers due to
expensive and risky development (e.g. high attrition rate in pharmaceutical development),
high quality and security requirements (e.g. clinical performance, safety, data privacy and
cybersecurity) and market specificities (e.g. strong regulation, pricing and reimbursement
issues). In addition, the growing concern about environmental issues is putting more pressure
on this industry. Therefore, there is a need for research and innovation integrating various
stakeholders to facilitate market access of innovative health technologies (medical
technologies, pharmaceuticals, biotechnologies, digital health technologies).
In order to address these challenges, in particular green and digital transitions and proper
supply of health technologies and products, destination 6 will focus on research and
innovation activities that aim at:
• Facilitating the production of pharmaceuticals in compliance with the objectives of the
European Green Deal.
• Developing methodologies, guidelines and standards, assessment studies, and structuring
activities adapted to digital solutions and interventions for GDPR compliant translation
into health care practice, including inter-operability, cyber-security and data
confidentiality.
• Supporting public authorities with better methodologies and interdisciplinary approaches
to assess and value new health technologies and interventions.

In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European
Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable
cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities
such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and
adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential
synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects
funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing
projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to
European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic
challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas
cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance,
with cluster 4 “Digital, Industry and Space” such as on industrial research and innovation
infrastructures (pilot plants, testing and simulation facilities, open innovation hubs); additive
manufacturing and other production technologies (incl. bio manufacturing); safe, smart and
sustainable materials.
Expected Impacts:
Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to
maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health industry, and more
specifically to one or several of the following expected impacts:
• Health industry in the EU is more competitive and sustainable, assuring European
leadership in breakthrough health technologies and open strategic autonomy in essential
medical supplies and digital technologies, contributing to job creation and economic
growth, in particular with small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
• Health industry is working more efficiently along the value chain from the identification
of needs to the scale-up and take-up of solutions at national, regional or local level,
including through early engagement with patients, health care providers, health
authorities and regulators ensuring suitability and acceptance of solutions.
• European standards, including for operations involving health data, ensure patient safety
and quality of healthcare services as well as effectiveness and interoperability of health
innovation and productivity of innovators.
• Citizens, health care providers and health systems benefit from a swift uptake of
innovative health technologies and services offering significant improvements in health
outcomes, while health industry in the EU benefits from decreased time-to-market.
• Health security in the EU benefits from reliable access to key manufacturing capacity,
including timely provision of essential medical supplies of particularly complex or
critical supply and distribution chains, such as regards vaccines or medical radioisotopes.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable
and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim
to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following
expected outcomes:
• Identification of the most innovative HTA methods developed by EU-funded projects,
which respond to the needs of HTA bodies and are ready to be used in real-life settings.
Endorsement by HTA bodies of such innovative methods would allow for advancing
HTA methodology and improve evidence-based decision making, and patient access to
novel health technologies
• Dissemination among EU HTA bodies of robust innovative HTA methods and tools
developed by EU-funded projects.
• Harmonisation of HTA expertise across EU though the development of a training
programme developed in collaboration with academia. The training should address HTA
expertise in general, as wells as expertise in joint HTA to be carried out at EU level in
accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/2282, based on the methodological guidelines
elaborated by the Coordination Group on HTA.
• Contribution to a successful implementation of the HTA Regulation as well as to
building an EU methodological HTA framework fit for purpose and fit for the future.
Scope: HTA bodies have the responsibility to assess the added value of new health
technologies and advise on its reimbursement and use within a healthcare system. Due to the
rapid pace at which technology advance and in order to support decision making in an
appropriate manner, HTA experts have to adapt/revise regularly their methodology. Whilst
EU-funded projects in the field of HTA have addressed some of the research needs of the
HTA bodies (e.g. methods of analysis, use of real-world data, use of patient reported
outcomes), translation of their results/recommendations into HTA work remains limited.
Advancing HTA methodology and expertise could benefit from a more systematic dialogue
between HTA bodies and academia. Therefore, this action could represent an excellent
opportunity for both those generating and those using the evidence to come together and
discuss the key HTA methodological issues.
Under the newly adopted Regulation (EU) 2021/2282, the Coordination Group on HTA will
have to adopt methodological guidelines for joint HTA work (e.g. joint clinical assessments,
joint scientific consultation), to regularly review, and where necessary update them. The
project could provide input to issues identified by the Coordination Group as important for
future updates/revisions of HTA methodology for joint HTA work.

The topic is divided into two strands of activities, with applicants tackling both in their
proposals:
• Implementation of innovative HTA methods: EU-funded research projects (e.g.
COMED, IMPACT-HTA, HTx, GetReal, EHDEN) developed innovative methods
aiming at addressing HTA bodies’ needs. Identifying which of these methods are ready
to be used in real-life settings is a first crucial step towards broader uptake and
dissemination. Successful implementation of innovative methods in actual HTA
practices will contribute to provide a timely response to HTA challenges (e.g. use of
real-world data in HTA) also providing a sound scientific resource for updates of
methodological guidelines by the Coordination Group on HTA for joint activities as
requested by the Regulation (EU) 2021/2282. HTA bodies/agencies participating in such
activities will gain expertise in those methods that could be later transferred to other
bodies/agencies using the training framework developed in the second strand of work.
• Advancing HTA expertise across the EU and Associated Countries should be
carried out through a training programme tailored to the needs of HTA bodies, which
may include twinning activities between HTA bodies/agencies to develop expertise and
facilitate knowledge sharing among HTA bodies/agencies in the EU. The training
programme is expected to contribute to the harmonisation of HTA practices in the EU
that will in turn contribute to a greater consistency of health technology assessments
across the EU and Associated Countries. Thus, the training programme should also
support the engagement of HTA experts from Member States and EEA countries in
carrying out joint HTA work starting January 2025 (i.e. implementation date of the
Regulation on HTA), with the aim to produce high-quality and robust joint clinical
assessments. The training programme should include all the necessary elements for
carrying out robust assessments at national and EU level. Regarding the latter, the
training programme should also promote the dissemination of the methodological
guidelines to be adopted by the Coordination Group on HTA (based on the methodology
developed and fine-tuned by EUnetHTA joint actions and EUnetHTA21 service
contract).
The proposals should address all of the following activities:
• Identification of innovative methods and tools, in particular those developed in EU-
funded projects able to address HTA bodies' needs (in different areas: relative
effectiveness assessment, cost-effectiveness assessment, etc.)
• Identifications of barriers to the uptake of these methods (and potential associated tools,
e.g. open-source software to run cost-effectiveness analyses)
• Use cases (based on the needs identified by HTA bodies) to facilitate the endorsement by
HTA bodies of innovative methods

• Development of an implementation plan including supporting tools and training modules
(by researchers, alone or in collaboration with HTA bodies, to be delivered to HTA
bodies/agencies)
• Recommendations for broader dissemination.

tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes, and provide
appropriate qualitative and quantitative indicators to measure their progress and specific
impact:
• European Health Record (EHR) stakeholders (e.g. developers, suppliers, integrators, and
operators) have at their disposal and use fit-for-purpose standards, guidelines, and
toolsets for prioritised health information domains to address interoperability of EHRs in
Part 4 - Page 205 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
line with the principles set in the EEHRxF Recommendation314, contributing also to
security and privacy.
• Stakeholders have at their disposal better quality and better integrated health datasets
within the European Health Data Space,315 to foster innovations in the health sector and
leverage the potential of new analytics solutions such as AI and big data, get new
insights and detect trends from aggregated data, including for cross-border health threats.
• Citizens are provided with an expanded access to their health data, also across borders,
and innovative digital services for high-quality health and care across the EU.
Scope: EHR interoperability has yet to become a reality in a number of use cases and health
information domains. It is a complex, multi-dimensional challenge. EHRs across the Member
States are diverse; so are languages, cultures, and practices in the health sector. Different
technical specifications, technologies and clinical terminologies are used, involving a range of
stakeholders, within and across care settings.
Proposals should address all of the following:
• Research, develop and validate harmonised interoperability formats for sharing data in
specific priority health information domains that should be selected with reference to the
EU policies and priorities. The output formats should enable EHR interoperability across
the Member States and address cross-border health data exchange by design and in line
with the principles set in the EEHRxF Recommendation.
• Leverage and scale up the potential of EHR through enhanced interoperability to
improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of patient care, enforce patients' right to data
portability, enhance care coordination, guide crisis planning, reduce medical errors, and
lower costs. For example, based on the lessons learnt from COVID-19, enable
incorporating EHR data into the early stages of clinical crisis planning and leveraging it
to identify potential cross-border health threats based on analysis of patients’ data trends.
• Address semantic interoperability for prioritised information domains so that the
transmitted health record contains standardised coded data.
• Maximise synergies with relevant initiatives, activities and programmes, building upon
previous and linking to on-going actions316.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable
and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim
to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following
expected outcomes:
• Developers and regulators have access to robust modelling and simulation tools to
accelerate the effective development of orphan and/or paediatric medicinal products.
• Clinical researchers, developers and regulators use accurate computational models to
improve the statistical robustness in clinical trials intended for small populations and
guide cost-effective clinical trial designs.
Part 4 - Page 207 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Clinical researchers and regulators have access to accurate in-silico tools for assessing
the actionable use of real-world data and for successfully estimating the risk-benefit
effects in clinical trials for small populations.
• Regulators develop guidance for the use of validated computational models to support a
robust extrapolation framework and facilitate the safety and efficacy assessment in the
process of regulatory appraisal of orphan and/or paediatric medicinal products.
Scope: In its "Regulatory Science Strategy to 2025", the European Medicines Agency
included specific recommendations to optimise the capabilities of modelling and simulation in
the medicines development process and in particular to benefit special populations and
neglected patient populations.
Orphan drug development faces numerous challenges, including low disease prevalence,
patient population heterogeneity and strong presence of paediatric patient populations.
Consequently, clinical trials for orphan and/or paediatric medicines are often smaller than
traditional large-scale randomised ones and they require the development of efficient trial
designs relevant to small.
Model-based approaches are significantly advantageous in small populations, as extrapolation
tools for rationalising and increasing the statistical robustness in clinical trial designs and
pharmacometric studies.
The topic will support research and innovation activities focusing on the development of
diverse modelling and simulation methods, as tools for addressing some of the regulatory
needs in the clinical development cycle of new orphan and paediatric medicinal products. The
topic is not intended to implement new preclinical/clinical studies but to use the existing
knowledge/data for assessing and optimising the performance of mature in-silico models in
the regulatory context with the goal of improving the clinical trial designs for small
populations. Availability of the relevant data to address the requirements of the topic is an
indispensable condition that must be demonstrated at the proposal submission.
Proposals should involve national healthcare product regulatory bodies and the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) in order to catalyse an effective collaboration between the
researchers and the regulators. The active involvement of patient representatives is required in
all phases of the research and innovation activities. Furthermore, SME(s) participation is
encouraged with the aim to strengthen their scientific and technological basis.
The proposals should address all of the following activities:
• Establish a multidisciplinary approach for assessing the utility of mature computational
models, as tools for supporting the optimal design of innovative clinical trials for small
populations and as fit-for-purpose solutions for enabling the regulatory scientific advice
and marketing authorisation assessment of orphan and/or paediatric medicines, including
their pharmacovigilance follow-up.
Part 4 - Page 208 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Calibrate and optimise mature computational models for enhancing their clinical
performance, by using relevant sources of patient data (e.g. natural history and
observational clinical studies, medical records, registries, pharmacovigilance and
longitudinal studies etc.). The models should include a variety of modelling methods and
in particular hybrid solutions linking quantitative mechanistic modelling with advanced
statistical modelling (e.g. quantitative systems pharmacology, disease mechanistic
models, physiology-based pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic models, Bayesian
modelling, artificial intelligence algorithms etc.).
• Assess validated in-silico models for their capability to increase the statistical
robustness, improve the risk/benefit assessment in small population clinical trials, and
for their accuracy to predict and extrapolate the therapeutic and dose effects, taking into
account the patient’s genotypes/phenotypes, disease characteristics/stage variables
and/or clinical/surrogate endpoints for delivering robust evidence of safety and efficacy
of the orphan and paediatric medicines under study. The assessment of the in-silico
models should be demonstrated in use cases representing well-justified group(s) of rare
and/or paediatric diseases with commonalities, such as shared molecular
denominators/disease pathways within the same and/or across different medical areas,
excluding cancer and infectious diseases.
• Benchmark of diverse computational models by showcasing their simulation
performance in virtual patient cohorts and by demonstrating that the models’ synthetic
data estimates match to actual clinical trial data. This should lead to an assessment of the
performance and credibility of a model simulation in the context of their specific use for
regulatory purposes. Benchmark studies should be performed in the use cases mentioned
above. Availability of clinical trials data and other relevant data is an indispensable
requirement that must be demonstrated at the proposal submission.
• Set-up the criteria for the performance and credibility assessment of any relevant
computational models for small population clinical trials to progress on their regulatory
qualification and acceptability. Further develop and disseminate standards for the design,
performance assessment and reporting of modelling and simulation tools with an
emphasis on those of high regulatory value for accelerating the clinical development of
orphan and paediatric medicinal products.
The proposals should adhere to the FAIR data317 principles, adopt data quality standards, data
integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data sharing/access good practices
developed by the European research infrastructures, where relevant. Proposals are invited to
consider adopting recommendations for in-silico models construction and validation318. Data-
intensive proposals, particularly those using data from patient registries, should take stock of
the tools and services provided by the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU

EU RD platform, if reasonably feasible.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and
joint activities. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the
participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption
of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and
joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or
other EU programmes. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the
attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other
potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.
The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation
phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable
and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim
to deliver results that are directed towards and contributing to all of the following expected
outcomes:
• Challenging aspects of regulation, policy, safety, efficacy, manufacturing, organisation,
infrastructure, decision-making, and commercialisation are identified for speeding up the
equitable clinical applications of ATMPs.
• European regulatory frameworks are adapted to novel scientific progress, especially
those related to platform approaches, genome editing, interface with medical devices,
artificial intelligence.
• Competent authorities in the Member States can propose adapted pricing and
reimbursement schemes that allow European citizens to benefit from novel ATMPs.
• Academic and SME developers and manufacturers of ATMPs have an increased
knowledge of the regulatory aspects.
• The decentralised manufacturing of ATMPs is consistent across health care centres.
Scope: New pioneering treatments called Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs),
including cell and gene therapies, have the potential to bring new cures to patients affected by
diseases with limited or no available treatments. However, several hurdles impede or slow
down the access of ATMPs to patients in the EU and Associated Countries. These include e.g.
regulatory challenges, underlying scientific uncertainties, differences in assessing the values
of ATMPs by the various Health Technology Agencies (HTA), difficulties to perform
randomised-controlled clinical trials or to obtain long-term safety and effectiveness data, the
lack of harmonised approaches to the reimbursement of the high upfront costs by health
systems, manufacturing processes, etc.
The proposals should address all of the following activities:
• Map the regulatory, safety and efficacy assessment, manufacturing, organisational and
infrastructural needs to improve the translation of ATMPs from preclinical development
to clinical use.
• Address the gaps and uncertainties in regulatory and policy aspects pertinent to complex
innovative ATMPs.
• Address predictivity of preclinical data for safety and efficacy testing of ATMPs.
Improved novel models could be proposed.
Part 4 - Page 211 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025

• Tackle decision-making processes relating to ATMPs, such as for instance the
assessment of their values, the demonstration of the long-term safety and effectiveness,
or new pricing and reimbursement frameworks.
• Propose opportunities for an improved knowledge of the regulatory processes among
academic ATMP developers.
• Involve regulatory authorities, Health Technology Agencies (HTA), clinicians, ethics
committees, and patients, with the aim to ensure higher clinical use of ATMPs. The
findings of the project will be available to competent authorities, ATMP developers and
manufacturers as well as to national/regional funding agencies.

this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed towards and contributing to all of the
following expected outcomes:
Part 4 - Page 212 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• Policymakers in the EU have at their disposal a methodological framework and
standardised approaches for assessing digital health technologies, that helps them make
evidence-based decisions regarding the introduction of digital health technologies in
their health and care systems with added value for patients and society.
• Regulators have access to robust, scientifically underpinned evaluation methodologies.
• EU citizens gain faster access to safe and well-performing person-centred digital
technologies and are empowered through these tools.
• Health technology developers are better informed and dispose of more guidance on the
evidence needed to demonstrate the added value of digital health technologies and have
better insights on market predictability.
• (Digital) Health Industry/digital health technology developers and HTA bodies can
contribute to the development of EU harmonised Health Technology Assessment (HTA)
rules based on common principles.
• Improved cross-border use and interoperability of digital health tools and services
throughout the EU and Associated Countries.
• Increased trust in digital health technologies and better integration of digital health tools
and services in health and care systems.
Scope: Digital health technologies have been driving a revolution in health and care ranging
from general use of computers to algorithms designed to assist radiologists and radiotherapists
in detecting and treating diseases, from robotic surgery to artificial intelligence, machine
learning, computer aided decision models, and from mobile apps helping patients to self-
manage their disease to electronic health records.
Digital health technologies are expected to further contribute to better people-centred health
and care systems and have the vast potential to improve our ability to accurately prevent,
diagnose and treat diseases.
However, assessing the added value and health benefits for patients and society pose a
number of challenges in particular of methodological and technical nature. Best practice for
common approaches in methodology for digital health are lacking, especially in the digital
health tools that include artificial intelligence algorithms. A framework for the assessment of
the digital transformation of health services and its impact is vital to generate the evidence
required for decision-making on stimulating, using and/or funding digital health strategies at
various levels in the health and care systems.

development of assessment methodologies and in a European repository for evaluation
methods and evidence of digital health services.
To date, such assessment frameworks are relatively scarce, especially those addressing the
transformative aspects of healthcare delivery on the organisational and operational level.
The proposals are expected to develop and harmonise methodologies for assessing digital
health technologies (including mhealth apps and telehealth, as well as Artificial Intelligence
powered health technologies) in order to facilitate assessment of their added value at
individual, health system and society levels and facilitate the cross-border deployment of
digital health services within the EU. Existing Health Technology Assessment (HTA)
methodology is well developed for health technologies such as medicinal products, but also
for some categories of medical devices; however digitalisation raises new methodological
challenges to the standardisation of assessment criteria such as privacy, cybersecurity, data
storage and handling, interoperability, usability etc. Also including aspects like learning
curves, iterative development of innovations, variability between settings, determining
optimal timing of evaluations in the development process (maturity) are not yet solved.
Proposals are expected to build on existing frameworks such as (but not restricted to) ‘Model
for Assessment of Telemedicine’ (MAST framework – Kidholm et al., 2012) and the results
of previous EU-funded projects in particular (but not restricted to) COMED, project that
already identified HTA challenges of telehealth and mhealth, and mHealth hub320.
Proposals should consider involving the JRC to take advantage of its expertise on assessment
frameworks of innovative health technologies and its activities at the interface between
research and regulatory aspects and/or in translating assessment results into best practice
recommendations anchored in EU policies. In that respect, the JRC is open to collaborate with
any successful proposal after its approval.
The proposals should address all of the following activities:
• Develop and/or expand a general methodological framework and standardised
approaches to assess digital health technologies with a particular focus on criteria such
as privacy, cybersecurity, data quality, data storage and handling, interoperability etc.;
• Comply with the relevant requirements proposed in the European Health Data Space
(EHDS) legal provisions;
• Test the robustness of the developed methodologies on minimum 3 different digital
health technology use cases;
• Pilot the development of common specifications to the harmonisation of assessment
frameworks (pre-market and post-market phases) throughout the EU and Associated
Countries;

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable
and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim
to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following
expected outcomes:
• Patients gain faster access to innovative, safe and well-performing medical devices;
• Regulators have access to sound scientific resources for clinical/performance evaluation
guidance and development of common specifications as foreseen in Article 9 of the
Medical Device Regulation (MDR);
• Notified bodies, by their direct participation to the production of documents, will have a
harmonised way of assessing the clinical evidence in the pre-market and post-market
phases; furthermore their network323, will be enhanced;
• Health technology developers gain insight on the evidence needed to demonstrate that
their devices meet MDR clinical requirements throughout their lifetime. They will also
have more guidance on the use of real-world data for their clinical development
strategies.
Scope: The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and in vitro diagnostic medical device
Regulation (IVDR) provides a new regulatory framework where reinforcement of
clinical/performance evaluation of medical devices and IVDs, and in particular high-risk
medical devices, is a key element. The confirmation of conformity with the relevant general
safety and performance requirements set out in the MDR and IVDR324 is based on clinical
data and its assessment (clinical/performance evaluation), including the evaluation of the
acceptability of the benefit-risk- ratio. Within this new framework, the clinical/performance
evaluation should follow a defined and methodologically sound procedure based on the
critical evaluation of the relevant scientific literature, a critical evaluation of the results of all
available clinical investigations/performance studies, as well as consideration of currently
available alternative treatment options for the device under evaluation. Clinical/performance
evaluation has to be updated throughout the life cycle of the device. Hence,
clinical/performance evaluation can draw on multiple types of data including data from initial
clinical investigations/performance studies and data gathered by the manufacturer's post-
market surveillance system. To operationalise this new requirement, research is needed to
help regulators develop common methodological frameworks (including common
specifications325) on the clinical evidence needed to demonstrate safety, performance and

clinical benefit all along the life cycle of devices taking into account the type of device and
clinical intended purpose.
Such methodological frameworks and standardised approaches are particularly needed for
high-risk medical devices, e.g. implantable and class III medical devices, class C and D IVDs,
medical device software (including AI enabled devices and next generation sequencing) and
other highly innovative devices.
In order to address the differences between evidence generation for medical devices and
IVDs, the project should be tackled taking into account those differences.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:
• Development of a framework for a life-cycle approach to evidence generation and
evaluation of high-risk and innovative medical devices and IVDs. This framework will
provide a description of the types of evidence i) that meet safety and performance for
market access, and ii) that have to be generated to fulfil post-market responsibilities.
When appropriate it would be beneficial to consider to what extent the framework could
be relevant to demonstrate relative effectiveness as needed for Health Technology
Assessment. As regards highly innovative devices, particular attention may be paid to
defining acceptable levels of uncertainty in terms of benefit-risk ratio at market entry as
well as the type of post-market follow-up to be implemented to generate additional
clinical evidence able to reduce this uncertainty. This could be particularly relevant for
devices e.g. having no or little similarities with existing devices in terms of intended
purpose, mode of action, materials or, for IVDs, with no existing reference materials.;
• For medical devices, a pilot to support development of common specifications which
would set the stage for a common specification ecosystem for medical devices in the
EU326, including the development of standardised/common endpoints and associated
health outcomes measures by technology type and where relevant by clinical intended
purpose;
• Development of a general methodological approach to define, determine and update the
state of the art for different device technologies. The robustness of the developed
approach should be evaluated on 3 different medical device types and 3 different IVD
types;
• Possible use of registries and other sources of real-world data for demonstration of
regulatory compliance both pre- and post-market: minimum requirements for data
quality, completeness and data reliability, statistical methods for data analysis, methods
for limiting biases, methods for data linkage, determination of what acceptable evidence
can be drawn from registries;
• Methodology for bridging studies for devices and IVDs with iterative development:
assessment of data coming from previous versions of the device and where relevant
326 building on previous initiatives such as PARENT, CORE-MD, JAMS
Part 4 - Page 218 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
integration of that data into the device’s clinical investigation/performance study and gap
assessment between the different versions of the device;
• Identification of relevant quantitative and qualitative methodologies for integrating
evidence derived from various data sources in the clinical evaluation/performance
evaluation;
Proposals should build on relevant completed and ongoing initiatives in the field, in particular
(but not restricted to) EU-funded initiatives.327 Proposals should involve researchers who are
specialised in the clinical/performance evaluation of medical devices/IVDs and in the use of
real-world data to evaluate medical products. Proposals should involve national competent
authorities, notified bodies, IVD laboratories as well as Health Technology Assessment
bodies and could involve patients’ representatives where relevant.
Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical
studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. See

consortium selected for funding.
Award criteria The criteria are described in General Annex D. The following exceptions
apply:
The thresholds for each criterion will be 4 (Excellence), 4 (Impact) and 3
(Implementation). The cumulative threshold will be 12.
Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing
to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable
and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim
to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following
expected outcomes:
• European regulators gain state-of-the-art knowledge on different NAMs that are being
proposed for the assessment of the safety and efficacy of chemicals and pharmaceuticals;
• European regulators understand better the shortcomings of the current tools based on
animal procedures for the assessment of chemicals and pharmaceuticals;
• European regulators collaborate on a framework on how to assess the safety of
chemicals based on NAM-data and how to classify the hazardous properties based on
such data;
• European regulators collaborate on a similar framework for assessment of safety and
efficacy of pharmaceuticals based on NAM-data;
• Citizens benefit from the supply and use of chemicals and pharmaceuticals that have
been assessed through NAMs that are better predicting potential effects in humans than
the current assessment methods;
• Industry has an improved competitive position with the availability of harmonised and
standardised NAM-based assessment tools that are faster and more flexible;
• European Commission and Member States regulators are responding to the societal
demand to move away from animal testing.
Scope: There is increasing scientific evidence pointing to the limitations of animal testing for
safety and efficacy assessment of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Europe is also experiencing
a strong societal demand to move away from animal testing. Scientific progress of the past
two decades has produced a number of animal-free New Approach Methodologies (NAMs)
that have the potential to be used instead of the animal models that are currently employed for
such testing. However, knowledge, experience and confidence on how results from the NAM
assays could be used is still lacking among regulators, which could limit the industry’s use of
NAMs because of lack of legal certainty when generating safety and health data requested by
EU legislation.
Part 4 - Page 220 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
The proposals should focus on alternatives to the use of animals for regulatory safety and
efficacy testing. Applicants should propose activities that bring together NAM developers and
NAM users with European regulators responsible for the safe use of chemicals (e.g. industrial
chemicals, pesticides, biocides and cosmetics) and pharmaceuticals in order to inform on
NAM solutions available and to encourage the building of a framework on how these NAMs
could be most effectively used in the different decision-making contexts. For NAMs
applicable to chemical risk assessment, collaboration with existing initiatives such as the
Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) and the ASPIS cluster of
projects (Animal-free Safety Assessment of chemicals: Project cluster for Implementation of
novel Strategies) is encouraged.
To build such a framework the proposals should address all of the following:
• develop technical and regulatory readiness criteria
• reflect on how to provide mechanisms to support technology transfer, i.e. bringing
promising NAMs to the market (including optimisation and transferability assessment)
• discuss how to standardise NAMs and NAM-based strategies via OECD, CEN, ISO,
ICH, VICH and other international organisations, as applicable
• provide technical training for Contract Research Organisations (CROs) applying NAMs
for regulatory purposes
• promote dialogue (involving companies, regulatory bodies on EU level, including
ECHA, EMA and EFSA and Member States authorities) on how to integrate and
interpret data from NAMs and facilitate their uptake for safety and efficacy testing of
chemicals (including pesticides) and pharmaceuticals, while addressing the lack of
reliability and shortcomings of the current tools based on animal procedures
• identify obstacles in EU legislation for the regulatory use of NAMs and propose
options/changes in the EU regulatory framework which address these obstacles and
facilitate the uptake and use of NAMs
Proposals should consider involving the JRC to take advantage of its expertise and relevant
activities in bridging research and regulatory communities and facilitating uptake of NAMs
for regulatory application. In that respect, the JRC is open to collaborate with any successful
proposal after its approval.

entities identified below as CEPI has been a key partner for implementing the common Union
response to the COVID-19 epidemic.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is an international non-profit
association established under Norwegian Law. It was founded by the Governments of
Norway, Germany, Japan, India, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the
Wellcome Trust, and launched during the World Economic Forum in Davos 2017. Its
objective is to finance and coordinate the development of new medical countermeasures to
prevent and contain infectious diseases that have epidemic potential, before these diseases
become global health emergencies. The Horizon Europe funding will be used to enhance and
expand CEPI’s activities. This action will also contribute to the implementation of the
Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation and the EU’s
development policy, in particular attention will be given to the constraints national health
systems face in low- and middle-income countries.
Accordingly, the proposals should cover all of the following activities:
• Vaccine research and development for emerging pathogens to stop future epidemics.
• Research to advance adaptable vaccine technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine
and immunoprophylactic development against previously unknown pathogens.
• Engagement with relevant stakeholders in the area of epidemic preparedness ensuring
collaboration and coordination and avoiding duplication.
This action is expected to engage with other relevant initiatives, such as the new Partnership
for Pandemic Preparedness.

3. Presidency event - Spain. Genomics-based health strategies: towards personalised and
precision medicine
This action will cover the organisation of an event by the Spanish Presidency, focusing on
personalised medicine.
Personalised medicine has gained significant attention over the last decade as technologies for
understanding biological differences between individuals have advanced dramatically. There
are many potential benefits of personalised medicine and its development will change the way
in which some health services are delivered. Within the last decade, the EU has launched a
series of initiatives, of different nature, aimed at promoting personalised medicine: regarding
genomic medicine; the European Genome initiative, promoting collaborative consortia; ERA
PerMed and ICPerMed, the construction of the EHDS (European Health Data Space) within
the Digital Health Strategy of the EU and the forthcoming Genomic Data Infrastructure.
However, personalised medicine is a wide area of study which still have some challenges to
tackle.
The Spanish presidency event should be focused on the following aspects of personalised
medicine:
• Innovative health strategies based on genomics and personalised and precision medicine
to respond to unmet medical needs: improvements in cancer treatment, and prognosis of
rare diseases, prevention of common and complex diseases or high sensitivity to
infectious diseases.

“Europe united against old and new pandemics” and “The convergence of technologies
driving R&I towards the development of healthcare of the future”.
The conference “Europe united against old and new pandemics” will be informed by the
CSAs preparing the EU R&I partnerships on pandemic preparedness and response and on One
Health AMR. The conference should provide a platform to discuss and agree on the next steps
for the EU-partnership on pandemic preparedness and response and its role in supporting
HERA. Taking stock of the lessons learned from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
Part 4 - Page 226 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
embracing a “One Health - Planetary Health” approach, the conference should help prepare
for any pandemic threat - whether from emerging infectious diseases or antimicrobial
resistance.
The conference should reach out to policymakers and stakeholders in science, innovation and
public health as well as the European Commission.
The conference “The convergence of technologies enabling R&I for the healthcare of the
future” should focus on the convergence of technologies such as bio-, nano-, digital
technologies and engineering, which, in combination with omics data supplemented by health
and real-world data have the potential to push the boundaries of R&I in the field health.
However without proper integration of genomic and health data, R&I is hampered. Integrating
the Genome Data Infrastructure (GDI) into the European Health Data Space would enable
breakthroughs.
The conference should address the challenges linked to integrating genomics, and health and
real-world data, as well as the role and potential of converging technologies to accelerate the
development of personalised and preventive health management. Technologies such as single
cell technologies, innovative medical technologies and -omics analyses including human
microbiomics and lab- or cell-on-chip developments can accelerate the insights into what
determines health and disease and allow for true personalisation of health management and
preventive approaches.
The conference should draw on advances in the fields of cancer and rare diseases and may
also focus on the needs for skills of the future related to genomic medicine and data
governance.
The conference should involve the member state ministries of R&I and public health as well
as the European Commission.

5. Presidency event - Hungary. Hungarian conference on Brain health
This action will cover the organisation of a conference of the Hungarian presidency on Brain
Health.
The conference should provide platforms for knowledge exchange and networking and should
draw on contributions from international organisations, research organisations, funders and
policymakers including the European Commission as well as patient representatives.
The conference should aim at creating a forum for reviewing existing and potential brain
health research initiatives including a possible future EU R&I partnership in the area of brain
health. Brain Health is an emerging and growing concept that encompasses neural
development, plasticity, functioning, and recovery including mental health aspects in a life
course perspective. Numerous interconnected social and biological determinants (incl.
genetics) play a role in brain development and brain health throughout the life course. Some
of the aspects of brain health are strongly linked to ageing, working, lifestyle and social life
situations. Dementia and other brain disorders will impose an ever-growing burden on the
healthcare systems due to the ageing of Europe’s population. Developing effective and high
quality health and social care for these conditions will require holistic and person-centred
multisectoral and interdisciplinary research collaborations spanning the fields of health
promotion and disease prevention, treatment, care and rehabilitation across the lifespan and
building on the active engagement of citizens and patients, their families and carers, as
appropriate.

6. Presidency event - Poland. Research and Innovations for health and quality of life -
how to exploit the exponential growth of possibilities
This action will cover the organisation of an event by the Polish Presidency aimed at
highlighting the critical role of research and innovation in harnessing technological
advancements to enhance human health and well-being. It will emphasise the immense
potential of merging diverse technologies to address complex healthcare challenges and
improve the quality of life for individuals in Europe and globally.
The innovation and development of health products and services involve a complex
ecosystem of interconnected sectors working together to translate scientific discoveries into
tangible solutions for patients and healthcare providers. To that end, the conference will bring
together stakeholders from sectors broadly categorised into four main areas:
• Research and Development include science and academia, government R&D
institutions, and pharma-biotech companies that engage in fundamental and applied
research, leading to discoveries in biology, medicine, and healthcare technology.
• Manufacturing and Supply Chain encompass pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical
device companies, healthcare IT providers, and distributors – i.e. companies which
ensure that the products and services developed by R&D are manufactured to high-
quality standards, transported efficiently, and made accessible to patients and healthcare
providers.
Part 4 - Page 229 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
• The Regulatory and Reimbursement includes government agencies, insurance
companies, and healthcare payers, who ensure the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of
health-related products and services.
• The Support and Advocacy include non-profit organisations, patient groups and other
public and private organisations and programs representing the interests of patients and
providing support and education to those affected by specific diseases or conditions.
The effective functioning of this complex ecosystem requires strong collaboration and
communication among policymakers and stakeholders in science, innovation and public
health as well as the European Commission. Only by working together will it be possible to
create a future where we use technology to improve the health and well-being of everyone.
The conference will create a forum for:
• networking and exchanging knowledge to confront the expectations, factual impact, and
challenges,
• informing regulatory frameworks, addressing potential barriers and collaborative
strategies to overcome these,
• facilitating discussions on market access considerations involving regulatory, industry
and HTA stakeholders,
• sharing best practices and potential for opportunities for scaling up what works.
As a result, the conference will develop the systemic perspective of needs and recommend
future directions of actions, collaborations, and synergies.

7. Presidency event - Denmark. Health care sustainability and ecosystems beyond
Horizon Europe
This action will cover the organisation of two conferences by the Danish Presidency:
“Achieving sustainability in health care and beyond” and “Tackling the challenges of the
European health ecosystem beyond Horizon Europe - for better health, healthcare and life
science industry based on research and innovation”.
Achieving sustainability in health care and beyond
The conference ”Achieving sustainability in health care and beyond” will address how the
eco-system of public health and regulatory authorities, universities, research organisations,
private sector, investors and civil society in partnership can overcome the challenges posed to
health and care systems in Europe by demographic change and the ageing society. Taking a
360 degree holistic partner-driven approach, the conference will invite stakeholders to discuss
models, methods and best practices to work across sectors and disciplines in support of
sustainable and innovative health care systems providing high quality health care to and with
patients and citizens. The holistic approach will aim to address the challenges and
opportunities faced by integrated health and care systems in relation to e.g. the continuum of
care, strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, technologies incl. AI and regulatory
barriers. The aim is to overcome the challenges and support a more inclusive, equitable,
efficient, resilient and sustainable health care system. The conference will also explore
potential synergies between Horizon Europe and other European initiatives and funding
programmes such as the partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems, the
EU4Health programme, the European Social Fund and Erasmus+.
The conference will contribute to European policies such as the European Care strategy, as
well as the outlined expected Cluster 1 - Health impacts in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan,
with key notes from policymakers and experts along with parallel sessions, workshops, and
exhibitions. The findings and recommendations will be gathered in a white paper for future
use.

Part 4 - Page 231 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
Tackling the present and future challenges of the European health ecosystem extends beyond
Horizon Europe. It requires cultivating a balanced research and innovation ecosystem, where
collaborative efforts towards innovation and strategic transformation are key to obtaining the
best solutions for the future without delay.
The high-level conference will focus on life science as an integrated part of the health and
research ecosystem. The conference will specifically address the following four strands:

Part 4 - Page 233 of 241Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2025
Health
In case of a public health emergency330 (such as a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC) according to the World Health Organization, a public health emergency
under Regulation (EU) 2022/2371 331 or under applicable national frameworks and
regulations), funding will be mobilised for:
• The award of grants without a call for proposals according to Article 195 (b) of the EU
Financial Regulation332 in exceptional and duly substantiated emergencies. At that time,
the Funding & Tenders Portal will open a dedicated section where proposals can be
submitted. This will be communicated to the National Contact Points. The invitation to
apply for funding will be open to all eligible entities or be limited to targeted entities,
taking into account the need to achieve the underlying objectives in a quick and efficient
manner considering the exceptional circumstances; and/or
• The award of additional funding for ongoing grant agreements funded through EU
Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation to cover additional activities
specifically linked to the public health emergency, in exceptional and duly substantiated
emergencies. Providing such additional funding to ongoing EU Framework Programmes
for Research and Innovation grants that can support pertinent short- and mid-term
research efforts to confront the public health emergency will save valuable time and
allow addressing the situation with the appropriate urgency. Restricted calls for
expression of interest or proposals will develop such additional activities or add
additional partners to existing EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation
actions.
It is expected that quality-controlled data are shared in accordance with the FAIR333
principles. The use of harmonised protocols in collaboration with other actors is
recommended for this purpose.
The standard eligibility and admissibility criteria, evaluation criteria, thresholds, weighting for
award criteria, maximum funding rate and conditions for providing financial support to third
parties, are provided in the General Annexes.
The beneficiaries must comply with the public emergency related provisions listed in the
General Annexes concerning the project implementation under - Intellectual Property Rights
(IPR), background and results, access rights and rights of use (article 16 and Annex 5) for the
duration of the Public Health Emergency; and under Communication, dissemination, open
science and visibility (article 17 and Annex 5) during the entire duration of the action and for
four years after the end of the action.
330 Should there be no Public Health Emergency in 2023, 2024 or 2025, the indicative budget may be
reallocated.
