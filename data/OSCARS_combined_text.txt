of research, to define the criteria for the European Code of Conduct include
proper research behaviour, to maximise the development and application of
the quality, reliability, and robustness of technologies in research in new ways,
3and the use and impact of social media to
share and disseminate research results.
The 2023 edition also takes account of
changes in data management practices,
the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), and recent developments in
Open Science and research assessment.
The 2023 edition of the European Code
of Conduct also reflects a new awareness
of the importance of research culture
in enabling research integrity and im-
plementing good research practices.
An effective European Code of Conduct
for the research community promotes an
ethical mindset. Its principles are relevant
across the research system and in all
disciplines and are applicable to publicly
funded and private research. It can be the
basis for local, national, and discipline-
specific policies and guidelines, and
applies to existing and new research
practices such as citizen science or
participatory research. Each stakeholder
within the research community needs to
take active responsibility for observing
and promoting these practices and the
principles that underpin them.
This document is an updated version of
the 2017 edition of the European Code of
Conduct for Research Integrity, developed
by the European Federation of Academies
of Sciences and Humanities (ALLEA). It is
updated periodically to take account of
evolving concerns and emerging areas so
that it can continue to be fit for purpose in
guiding the research community towards
good research practice.
41. Principles
Good research practices are based on
fundamental principles of research
integrity. They guide individuals, institu-
tions, and organisations in their work
as well as in their engagement with
the practical, ethical, and intellectual
challenges inherent in research.
These principles include:
• Reliability in ensuring the quality
of research, reflected in the design,
methodology, analysis, and use of
resources.
• Honesty in developing, undertaking,
reviewing, reporting, and communicating
research in a transparent, fair, full, and
unbiased way.
• Respect for colleagues, research
participants, research subjects, society,
ecosystems, cultural heritage, and the
environment.
• Accountability for the research from
idea to publication, for its managem ent
and organisation, for training, supervision,
and mentoring, and for its wider societal
impacts.

15Annex 2: Revision Process
The original European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity was developed in 2011
by the European Federation of Academies of Sciences and Humanities (ALLEA) and the
European Science Foundation (ESF). From the start, the European Code of Conduct has
been conceived as a living document that will be reviewed and revised as necessary to
take account of evolving concerns and emerging areas, so that it can continue to serve the
research community as a framework for good research practices.
A new version of the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity was developed
in 2017 by ALLEA. This revision was motivated by developments in, among others, the
European research funding and regulatory landscapes, institutional responsibilities,
communication and dissemination, the use of social media, review procedures, open
access publishing, the use of repositories, and citizen involvement in research. The
revision included extensive consultation among major stakeholders in European research,
both public and private, to ensure a sense of shared ownership.
The present document is a revision of the 2017 European Code of Conduct for Research
Integrity. This edition contains revisions to ensure that the European Code of Conduct
remains fit for purpose and relevant to all disciplines and emerging areas of research or
research practices. It takes account of changes in data management practices, the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and recent developments in Open Science and research
assessment. The changes reflect a new awareness of the importance of research culture in
enabling research integrity and implementing good research practices. They also reflect
greater awareness in the research community of mechanisms of discrimination and
exclusion and the responsibility of all actors to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion.

17Annex 4: ALLEA Permanent Working Group on Science and
Ethics
The ALLEA Permanent Working Group on Science and Ethics (PWGSE) is concerned with
a wide range of ‘internal’ (within the research community) and ‘external’ (relations
between science and society) issues. Since ethical considerations have been an
essential component in the consolidation of a united Europe, and also in the creation
of ALLEA, the PWGSE was established to bring together experts from academies across
Europe and provide them with a platform for continuous debate on research ethics
and research integrity.
The PWGSE has been extending its capacities and activities during recent years, in order
to adequately fulfil its mission of collective deliberation on topics such as research
integrity, ethics education in science and research training, ethics of scientific policy
advice, trust in science, scientific misconduct, and plagiarism, among others.
Further topics recently addressed include ethical issues of open access publishing,
reforming research assessment, and research on digital and (bio)medical technologies.
Additionally, the group provides expertise for Horizon 2020 Science with and for Society
(SwafS) and Horizon Europe WIDERA projects concerned with research ethics and
integrity, and supports ALLEA membership of the TechEthos project, which addresses
the ethics of new and emerging technologies with high socio-economic impact.
The PWGSE meets regularly and has also convened thematic meetings in wider
settings, typically in partnerships with other relevant transnational organisations. The
members of the PWGSE drew on their extensive network of experts and institutions
for the successful execution of the revision process of "The European Code of Conduct
for Research Integrity".

19ALLEA – All European Academies
ALLEA, the European Federation of Academies of Sciences and Humanities, represents
more than 50 academies from nearly 40 EU and non-EU countries. Since its foundation
in 1994, ALLEA speaks on behalf of its members on European and international stages,
promotes science as a global public good, and facilitates scientific collaboration
across borders and disciplines.
Academies are self-governing bodies of distinguished scientists drawn from all fields
of scholarly inquiry. They contain a unique human resource of intellectual excellence,
experience, and multidisciplinary knowledge dedicated to the advancement of science
and scholarship in Europe and the world.
Jointly with its members, ALLEA seeks to improve the conditions for research, to
provide the best independent and interdisciplinary science advice available, and to
strengthen the role of science in society. In doing so, ALLEA channels the expertise
of European academies for the benefit of the research community, decision-makers,
and the public. Outputs include science-based advice in response to topics that are
critical to society as well as activities to encourage scientific cooperation, reasoning,
and values through public engagement.
ALLEA is a not-for-profit association and remains fully independent from political,
religious, commercial, or ideological interests.

19 See Article 125 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
22Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]

(d) for lump sum costs or contributions (if any):
23Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
(i) they must be declared under one of the budget categories set out in Article 6.2
and Annex 2
(ii) the work must be properly implemented by the beneficiary in accordance
with Annex 1
(iii) the deliverables/outputs must be achieved in the period set out in Article 4
(with the exception of deliverables/outputs relating to the submission of the

(e) for unit, flat-rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to usual cost
accounting practices (if any):
(i) they must fulfil the general eligibility conditions for the type of cost

(ii) the cost accounting practices must be applied in a consistent manner, based
on objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding
(f) for financing not linked to costs (if any): the results must be achieved or the conditions
must be fulfilled as described in Annex 1.
In addition, for direct cost categories (e.g. personnel, travel & subsistence, subcontracting and
other direct costs) only costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can
therefore be attributed to it directly are eligible. They must not include any indirect costs (i.e.
costs that are only indirectly linked to the action, e.g. via cost drivers).
In-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge may be declared as eligible
direct costs by the beneficiaries which use them (under the same conditions as if they were
their own, provided that they concern only direct costs and that the third parties and their in-
kind contributions are set out in Annex 1 (or approved ex post in the periodic report, if their
use does not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; ‘simplified
approval procedure’).
6.2 Specific eligibility conditions for each budget category
For each budget category, the specific eligibility conditions are as follows:
Direct costs
A. Personnel costs
A.1 Costs for employees (or equivalent) are eligible as personnel costs, if they fulfil the
general eligibility conditions and are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an
employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the action.
They must be limited to salaries (including net payments during parental leave), social
security contributions, taxes and other costs linked to the remuneration, if they arise from
national law or the employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and be calculated on
the basis of the costs actually incurred, in accordance with the following method:
{daily rate for the person
24Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
multiplied by
number of day-equivalents worked on the action (rounded up or down to the nearest half-day)}.
The daily rate must be calculated as:
{annual personnel costs for the person
divided by
215}
The number of day-equivalents declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see
Article 20).
The actual time spent on parental leave by a person assigned to the action may be deducted
from the 215 days indicated in the above formula.
The total number of day-equivalents declared in EU grants, for a person for a year, cannot be
higher than 215, minus time spent on parental leave (if any).
For personnel which receives supplementary payments for work in projects (project-based
remuneration), the personnel costs must be calculated at a rate which:
- corresponds to the actual remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for the time
worked by the person in the action over the reporting period
- does not exceed the remuneration costs paid by the beneficiary for work in similar
projects funded by national schemes (‘national projects reference’)
- is defined based on objective criteria allowing to determine the amount to which the
person is entitled
and
- reflects the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay consistently bonuses or
supplementary payments for work in projects funded by national schemes.
The national projects reference is the remuneration defined in national law, collective
labour agreement or written internal rules of the beneficiary applicable to work in projects
funded by national schemes.
If there is no such national law, collective labour agreement or written internal rules or if the
project-based remuneration is not based on objective criteria, the national project reference
will be the average remuneration of the person in the last full calendar year covered by the
reporting period, excluding remuneration paid for work in EU actions.
If the beneficiary uses average personnel costs (unit cost according to usual cost accounting
practices), the personnel costs must fulfil the general eligibility conditions for such unit costs
and the daily rate must be calculated:
- using the actual personnel costs recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts and excluding
any costs which are ineligible or already included in other budget categories; the
actual personnel costs may be adjusted on the basis of budgeted or estimated elements,
25Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
if they are relevant for calculating the personnel costs, reasonable and correspond to
objective and verifiable information
and
- according to usual cost accounting practices which are applied in a consistent manner,
based on objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding.
A.2 and A.3 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract other than an
employment contract and costs for seconded persons by a third party against payment are
also eligible as personnel costs, if they are assigned to the action, fulfil the general eligibility
conditions and:
(a) work under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way
the work is organised, the tasks that are performed and the premises where they are
performed) and
(b) the result of the work belongs to the beneficiary (unless agreed otherwise).
They must be calculated on the basis of a rate which corresponds to the costs actually incurred
for the direct contract or secondment and must not be significantly different from those for
personnel performing similar tasks under an employment contract with the beneficiary.
A.4 The work of SME owners for the action (i.e. owners of beneficiaries that are small and
medium-sized enterprises20 not receiving a salary) or natural person beneficiaries (i.e.
beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary) may be declared as personnel
costs, if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are calculated as unit costs in
accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a.
A.6 For beneficiaries with personnel unit cost, the personnel costs under categories A.1-A.4
must be declared as unit cost and are eligible, if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions,
are calculated as unit costs in accordance with the method set out in Annex 2a and comply
with the conditions set out in Points A.1-A.4 for the underlying types of costs (personnel).
B. Subcontracting costs
Subcontracting costs for the action (including related duties, taxes and charges, such as non-
deductible or non-refundable value added tax (VAT)) are eligible, if they are calculated on the
basis of the costs actually incurred, fulfil the general eligibility conditions and are awarded
using the beneficiary’s usual purchasing practices — provided these ensure subcontracts with
best value for money (or if appropriate the lowest price) and that there is no conflict of
interests (see Article 12).
20 For the definition, see Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC: micro, small or medium-sized
enterprise (SME) are enterprises
- engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of their legal form (including, in particular, self-
employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or other activities, and partnerships or
associations regularly engaged in an economic activity) and
- employing fewer than 250 persons (expressed in ‘annual working units’ as defined in Article 5 of
the Recommendation) and which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an
annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million.

not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding the
grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; ‘simplified approval
procedure’).
C. Purchase costs
Purchase costs for the action (including related duties, taxes and charges, such as non-
deductible or non-refundable value added tax (VAT)) are eligible if they fulfil the general
eligibility conditions and are bought using the beneficiary’s usual purchasing practices —
provided these ensure purchases with best value for money (or if appropriate the lowest price)
and that there is no conflict of interests (see Article 12).
Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities/entities’ within the meaning of the EU

CHAPTER 4 GRANT IMPLEMENTATION
SECTION 1 CONSORTIUM: BENEFICIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES AND
OTHER PARTICIPANTS
ARTICLE 7 — BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries, as signatories of the Agreement, are fully responsible towards the granting
authority for implementing it and for complying with all its obligations.
They must implement the Agreement to their best abilities, in good faith and in accordance
with all the obligations and terms and conditions it sets out.
31 For the definition, see Article 183(2)(b) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: ‘operating grant’ means an
EU grant to finance “the functioning of a body which has an objective forming part of and supporting an EU
policy”.
32 Condition must be specified in the call.
35Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
They must have the appropriate resources to implement the action and implement the action
under their own responsibility and in accordance with Article 11. If they rely on affiliated
entities or other participants (see Articles 8 and 9), they retain sole responsibility towards the
granting authority and the other beneficiaries.
They are jointly responsible for the technical implementation of the action. If one of the
beneficiaries fails to implement their part of the action, the other beneficiaries must ensure
that this part is implemented by someone else (without being entitled to an increase of the
maximum grant amount and subject to an amendment; see Article 39). The financial
responsibility of each beneficiary in case of recoveries is governed by Article 22.
The beneficiaries (and their action) must remain eligible under the EU programme funding
the grant for the entire duration of the action. Costs and contributions will be eligible only as
long as the beneficiary and the action are eligible.
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:
(a) Each beneficiary must:
(i) keep information stored in the Portal Participant Register up to date (see
Article 19)
(ii) inform the granting authority (and the other beneficiaries) immediately of any
events or circumstances likely to affect significantly or delay the
implementation of the action (see Article 19)
(iii) submit to the coordinator in good time:
- the prefinancing guarantees (if required; see Article 23)
- the financial statements and certificates on the financial statements
(CFS) (if required; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
- the contribution to the deliverables and technical reports (see Article
21)
- any other documents or information required by the granting authority
under the Agreement
(iv) submit via the Portal data and information related to the participation of their
affiliated entities.
(b) The coordinator must:
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 11)
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the consortium and
the granting authority, unless the Agreement or granting authority specifies
otherwise, and in particular:
- submit the prefinancing guarantees to the granting authority (if any)
36Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- request and review any documents or information required and verify
their quality and completeness before passing them on to the granting
authority
- submit the deliverables and reports to the granting authority
- inform the granting authority about the payments made to the other
beneficiaries (report on the distribution of payments; if required, see
Articles 22 and 32)
(iii) distribute the payments received from the granting authority to the other
beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see Article 22).
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other
beneficiary or third party (including affiliated entities).
However, coordinators which are public bodies may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(ii)
last indent and (iii) above to entities with ‘authorisation to administer’ which they have
created or which are controlled by or affiliated to them. In this case, the coordinator retains
sole responsibility for the payments and for compliance with the obligations under the
Agreement.
Moreover, coordinators which are ‘sole beneficiaries’33 (or similar, such as European research
infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may delegate the tasks set out in Point (b)(i) to (iii) above to
one of their members. The coordinator retains sole responsibility for compliance with the
obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-
ordination, to ensure that the action is implemented properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written consortium agreement between the beneficiaries, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation of the consortium
- the management of access to the Portal
- different distribution keys for the payments and financial responsibilities in case of
recoveries (if any)
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (see Article
16)
- settlement of internal disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries.
33 For the definition, see Article 190(2) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509: “Where several entities satisfy
the criteria for being awarded a grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole
beneficiary, including where it is specifically established for the purpose of implementing the action
financed by the grant.”
37Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The internal arrangements must not contain any provision contrary to this Agreement.
[OPTION if selected for the grant: For linked actions, the beneficiaries must have
arrangements with the participants of the other action, to ensure that both actions are
implemented and coordinated properly.
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 1), these arrangements must be set
out in a written collaboration agreement with the participants of the other action or, if the
consortium is the same, as part of their consortium agreement, covering for instance:
- the internal organisation and decision making processes
- the areas where close collaboration/synchronisation is needed (e.g. on management of
outputs, common approaches towards standardisation, links with regulatory and policy
activities, common communication and dissemination activities, sharing of
information, access to background and results, etc.)
- settlement of disputes
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the beneficiaries in
both actions.
The arrangements with the participants of the other action must not contain any provision
contrary to this Agreement.]

Affiliated entities can charge costs and contributions to the action under the same conditions
as the beneficiaries and must implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1 in
accordance with Article 11.
Their costs and contributions will be included in Annex 2 and will be taken into account for
the calculation of the grant.
The beneficiaries must ensure that all their obligations under this Agreement also apply to
their affiliated entities.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the bodies mentioned in Article 25 (e.g. granting authority,
OLAF, Court of Auditors (ECA), etc.) can exercise their rights also towards the affiliated
entities.
Breaches by affiliated entities will be handled in the same manner as breaches by
beneficiaries. Recovery of undue amounts will be handled through the beneficiaries.

mentioned in that Article (e.g. granting authority, OLAF, Court of Auditors (ECA),
etc.).
Special rules on dispute settlement apply (see Data Sheet, Point 5).
10.2 Participants which are international organisations
Participants which are international organisations (IOs; if any) undertake to comply with their
obligations under the Agreement and:
- to respect general principles (including fundamental rights, values and ethical
principles, environmental and labour standards, rules on classified information,
intellectual property rights, visibility of funding and protection of personal data)
- for the submission of certificates under Article 24: to use either independent public
officers or external auditors which comply with comparable standards as those set out
in EU Directive 2006/43/EC35
- for the controls under Article 25: to allow for the checks, reviews, audits and
investigations by the bodies mentioned in that Article, taking into account the specific
agreements concluded by them and the EU (if any).
For such participants, nothing in the Agreement will be interpreted as a waiver of their
privileges or immunities, as accorded by their constituent documents or international law.
Special rules on applicable law and dispute settlement apply (see Article 43 and Data Sheet,
Point 5).
10.3 Pillar-assessed participants
Pillar-assessed participants (if any) may rely on their own systems, rules and procedures, in so
far as they have been positively assessed and do not call into question the decision awarding
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries.
‘Pillar-assessment’ means a review by the European Commission on the systems, rules and
procedures which participants use for managing EU grants (in particular internal control
system, accounting system, external audits, financing of third parties, rules on recovery and
exclusion, information on recipients and protection of personal data; see Article 157 EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509).
Participants with a positive pillar assessment may rely on their own systems, rules and
procedures, in particular for:
- record-keeping (Article 20): may be done in accordance with internal standards,
rules and procedures
35 Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of
annual accounts and consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
41Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- currency conversion for financial statements (Article 21): may be done in
accordance with usual accounting practices
- guarantees (Article 23): for public law bodies, prefinancing guarantees are not
needed
- certificates (Article 24):
- certificates on the financial statements (CFS): may be provided by their
regular internal or external auditors and in accordance with their internal
financial regulations and procedures
- certificates on usual accounting practices (CoMUC): are not needed if
those practices are covered by an ex-ante assessment
and use the following specific rules, for:
- recoveries (Article 22): in case of financial support to third parties, there will be no
recovery if the participant has done everything possible to retrieve the undue
amounts from the third party receiving the support (including legal proceedings)
and non-recovery is not due to an error or negligence on its part
- checks, reviews, audits and investigations by the EU (Article 25): will be
conducted taking into account the rules and procedures specifically agreed
between them and the framework agreement (if any)
- impact evaluation (Article 26): will be conducted in accordance with the
participant’s internal rules and procedures and the framework agreement (if any)
- grant agreement termination (Article 32): the final grant amount and final payment
will be calculated taking into account also costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after termination takes effect, if the contract was entered into
before the pre-information letter was received and could not reasonably be
terminated on legal grounds
- liability for damages (Article 33.2): the granting authority must be compensated
for damage it sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because
the action was not implemented in full compliance with the Agreement only if the
damage is due to an infringement of the participant’s internal rules and procedures
or due to a violation of third parties’ rights by the participant or one of its
employees or individual for whom the employees are responsible.
Participants whose pillar assessment covers procurement and granting procedures may also do
purchases, subcontracting and financial support to third parties (Article 6.2) in accordance
with their internal rules and procedures for purchases, subcontracting and financial support.
42Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Participants whose pillar assessment covers data protection rules may rely on their internal
standards, rules and procedures for data protection (Article 15).
The participants may however not rely on provisions which would breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants or beneficiaries or call into question the decision awarding the
grant, such as in particular:
- eligibility (Article 6)
- consortium roles and set-up (Articles 7-9)
- security and ethics (Articles 13, 14)
- IPR (including background and results, access rights and rights of use),
communication, dissemination and visibility (Articles 16 and 17)
- information obligation (Article 19)
- payment, reporting and amendments (Articles 21, 22 and 39)
- rejections, reductions, suspensions and terminations (Articles 27, 28, 29-32)
If the pillar assessment was subject to remedial measures, reliance on the internal systems,
rules and procedures is subject to compliance with those remedial measures.
Participants must inform the coordinator without delay of any changes to the systems, rules
and procedures that were part of the pillar assessment. The coordinator must immediately
inform the granting authority.
Pillar-assessed participants that have also concluded a framework agreement with the EU,
may moreover — under the same conditions as those above (i.e. not call into question the
decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants or
beneficiaries) — rely on the provisions set out in that framework agreement.

another reliable time-record system is in place; the granting authority may accept
alternative evidence supporting the time worked for the action declared, if it considers
that it offers an adequate level of assurance

entities)
- the explanation on the use of resources (or detailed cost reporting table, if required)
- the certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if required; see Article 24.2 and
Data Sheet, Point 4.3).
The financial statements must detail the eligible costs and contributions for each budget
category and, for the final payment, also the revenues for the action (see Articles 6 and 22).
All eligible costs and contributions incurred should be declared, even if they exceed the
amounts indicated in the estimated budget (see Annex 2). Amounts that are not declared in the
individual financial statements will not be taken into account by the granting authority.
By signing the financial statements (directly in the Portal Periodic Reporting tool), the
beneficiaries confirm that:
- the information provided is complete, reliable and true
- the costs and contributions declared are eligible (see Article 6)
53Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- the costs and contributions can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting
documents (see Article 20) that will be produced upon request (see Article 19) or in
the context of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 25)
- for the final periodic report: all the revenues have been declared (if required; see
Article 22).
Beneficiaries will have to submit also the financial statements of their affiliated entities (if
any). In case of recoveries (see Article 22), beneficiaries will be held responsible also for the
financial statements of their affiliated entities.
21.3 Currency for financial statements and conversion into euros
The financial statements must be drafted in euro.
Beneficiaries with general accounts established in a currency other than the euro must convert
the costs recorded in their accounts into euro, at the average of the daily exchange rates
published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union (ECB website),
calculated over the corresponding reporting period.
If no daily euro exchange rate is published in the Official Journal for the currency in question,
they must be converted at the average of the monthly accounting exchange rates published on
the European Commission website (InforEuro), calculated over the corresponding reporting
period.
Beneficiaries with general accounts in euro must convert costs incurred in another currency
into euro according to their usual accounting practices.
21.4 Reporting language
The reporting must be in the language of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed with the
granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
21.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a report submitted does not comply with this Article, the granting authority may suspend
the payment deadline (see Article 29) and apply other measures described in Chapter 5.
If the coordinator breaches its reporting obligations, the granting authority may terminate the
grant or the coordinator’s participation (see Article 32) or apply other measures described in
Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 22 — PAYMENTS AND RECOVERIES — CALCULATION OF
AMOUNTS DUE
22.1 Payments and payment arrangements
Payments will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
They will be made in euro to the bank account indicated by the coordinator (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.2) and must be distributed without unjustified delay (restrictions may apply to
distribution of the initial prefinancing payment; see Data Sheet, Point 4.2).
54Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]

Payments to this bank account will discharge the granting authority from its payment
obligation.
The cost of payment transfers will be borne as follows:
- the granting authority bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.
Payments by the granting authority will be considered to have been carried out on the date
when they are debited to its account.
22.2 Recoveries
Recoveries will be made, if — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards — it
turns out that the granting authority has paid too much and needs to recover the amounts
undue.
Each beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is in principle limited to their
own debt and undue amounts of their affiliated entities.
In case of enforced recoveries (see Article 22.4), affiliated entities will be held liable for
repaying debts of their beneficiaries, if required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet,
Point 4.4).
22.3 Amounts due
22.3.1 Prefinancing payments
The aim of the prefinancing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.
It remains the property of the EU until the final payment.
For initial prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
For additional prefinancings (if any), the amount due, schedule and modalities are also set
out in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2). However, if the statement on the use of the previous
prefinancing payment shows that less than 70% was used, the amount set out in the Data
Sheet will be reduced by the difference between the 70% threshold and the amount used.
The contribution to the Mutual Insurance Mechanism will be retained from the prefinancing
payments (at the rate and in accordance with the modalities set out in the Data Sheet, see
Point 4.2) and transferred to the Mechanism.
Prefinancing payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent)
against amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to
that beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
55Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.2 Amount due at beneficiary termination — Recovery
In case of beneficiary termination, the granting authority will determine the provisional
amount due for the beneficiary concerned. Payments (if any) will be made with the next
interim or final payment.
The amount due will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary
for all reporting periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the
funding rate to the accepted costs of the beneficiary), taking into account requests for a lower
contribution to costs and CFS threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the
contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked to
costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’ for the beneficiary.
The balance is then calculated by deducting the payments received (if any; see report on the
distribution of payments in Article 32), from the total accepted EU contribution:
{ total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments received (if
any)}}.
If the balance is positive, the amount will be included in the next interim or final payment to
the consortium.
If the balance is negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount due, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered and ask this
amount to be paid to the coordinator (confirmation letter).
If payment is not made to the coordinator by the date specified in the confirmation letter, the
granting authority may call on the Mutual Insurance Mechanism to intervene, if continuation
of the action is guaranteed and the conditions set out in the rules governing the Mechanism
are met.
56Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
In this case, it will send a beneficiary recovery letter, together with a debit note with the
terms and date for payment.
The debit note for the beneficiary will include the amount calculated for the affiliated entities
which also had to end their participation (if any).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
The amounts will later on also be taken into account for the next interim or final payment.
22.3.3 Interim payments
Interim payments reimburse the eligible costs and contributions claimed for the
implementation of the action during the reporting periods (if any).
Interim payments (if any) will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out
the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply
recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The interim payment will be calculated by the granting authority in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for the
reporting period, by first calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the
funding rate to the accepted costs of each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a
lower contribution to costs and CFS threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding
the contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked
to costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions from beneficiary
termination (if any). The resulting amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the interim payment ceiling
The resulting amount is then capped to ensure that the total amount of prefinancing and
interim payments (if any) does not exceed the interim payment ceiling set out in the Data
Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Interim payments (or parts of them) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
57Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
22.3.4 Final payment — Final grant amount — Revenues and Profit — Recovery
The final payment (payment of the balance) reimburses the remaining part of the eligible
costs and contributions claimed for the implementation of the action (if any).
The final payment will be made in accordance with the schedule and modalities set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 4.2).
Payment is subject to the approval of the final periodic report. Its approval does not imply
recognition of compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.
The final grant amount for the action will be calculated in the following steps:
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
Step 1 — Calculation of the total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘accepted EU contribution’ for the action for all
reporting periods, by calculating the ‘maximum EU contribution to costs’ (applying the
funding rate to the total accepted costs of each beneficiary), taking into account requests for a
lower contribution to costs, CFS threshold cappings (if any; see Article 24.5) and adding the
contributions (accepted unit, flat-rate or lump sum contributions and financing not linked to
costs, if any).
After that, the granting authority will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting
amount is the ‘total accepted EU contribution’.
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount
If the resulting amount is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.2, it will
be limited to the latter.
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule
If the no-profit rule is provided for in the Data Sheet (see Point 4.2), the grant must not
produce a profit (i.e. surplus of the amount obtained following Step 2 plus the action’s
revenues, over the eligible costs and contributions approved by the granting authority).
‘Revenue’ is all income generated by the action, during its duration (see Article 4), for
beneficiaries that are profit legal entities [OPTION if selected for the call: (— with the
exception of income generated by the exploitation of results, which are not considered as
revenues)].
If there is a profit, it will be deducted in proportion to the final rate of reimbursement of the
eligible costs approved by the granting authority (as compared to the amount calculated
following Steps 1 and 2 minus the contributions).
58Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The balance (final payment) is then calculated by deducting the total amount of prefinancing
and interim payments already made (if any), from the final grant amount:
{
final grant amount
minus
{prefinancing and interim payments made (if
any)}}.
If the balance is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator.
The amount retained for the Mutual Insurance Mechanism (see above) will be released and
paid to the coordinator (in accordance with the rules governing the Mechanism).
The final payment (or part of it) may be offset (without the beneficiaries’ consent) against
amounts owed by a beneficiary to the granting authority — up to the amount due to that
beneficiary.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU executive
agency, offsetting may also be done against amounts owed to other Commission services or
executive agencies.
Payments will not be made if the payment deadline or payments are suspended (see Articles
29 and 30).
If— despite the release of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism contribution — the balance is
negative, it will be recovered in accordance with the following procedure:
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the final grant amount, the amount to be
recovered and the reasons why
- requesting a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiaries within 30 days
of receiving notification and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received) and the coordinator has submitted the report on the
distribution of payments, it will calculate the share of the debt per beneficiary, by:
(a) identifying the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:
{{{
total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the
action}
multiplied by
}
final grant amount for the action ,
59Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
minus
}
{prefinancing and interim payments received by the beneficiary (if any)}
and
(b) dividing the debt:
{
{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned
divided by
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to
point (a)}
multiplied by
the amount to be
recovered}.
and confirm the amount to be recovered from each beneficiary concerned (confirmation
letter), together with debit notes with the terms and date for payment.
The debit notes for beneficiaries will include the amounts calculated for their affiliated
entities (if any).
If the coordinator has not submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the granting
authority will recover the full amount from the coordinator (confirmation letter and debit
note with the terms and date for payment).
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.3.5 Audit implementation after final payment — Revised final grant amount —
Recovery
If — after the final payment (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see
Article 25) — the granting authority rejects costs or contributions (see Article 27) or reduces
the grant (see Article 28), it will calculate the revised final grant amount for the beneficiary
concerned.
The beneficiary revised final grant amount will be calculated in the following step:
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
Step 1 — Calculation of the revised total accepted EU contribution
The granting authority will first calculate the ‘revised accepted EU contribution’ for the
beneficiary, by calculating the ‘revised accepted costs’ and ‘revised accepted contributions’.
After that, it will take into account grant reductions (if any). The resulting ‘revised total
accepted EU contribution’ is the beneficiary revised final grant amount.
If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s final grant amount (i.e. its
share in the final grant amount for the action), it will be recovered in accordance with the
following procedure:
60Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The beneficiary final grant amount (i.e. share in the final grant amount for the action) is
calculated as follows:
{{
{total accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary
divided by
total accepted EU contribution for the
action}
multiplied by
}
final grant amount for the action .
The granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to recover, the amount to be recovered and the reasons
why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If no observations are submitted (or the granting authority decides to pursue recovery despite
the observations it has received), it will confirm the amount to be recovered (confirmation
letter), together with a debit note with the terms and the date for payment.
Recoveries against affiliated entities (if any) will be handled through their beneficiaries.
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the granting authority will
enforce recovery in accordance with Article 22.4.
22.4 Enforced recovery
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount due will be
recovered:
(a) by offsetting the amount — without the coordinator or beneficiary’s consent —
against any amounts owed to the coordinator or beneficiary by the granting authority.
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU financial interests, the amount may
be offset before the payment date specified in the debit note.
For grants where the granting authority is the European Commission or an EU
executive agency, debts may also be offset against amounts owed by other
Commission services or executive agencies.
(b) financial guarantee(s): not applicable
(c) joint and several liability of beneficiaries: not applicable
(d) by holding affiliated entities jointly and severally liable (if any, see Data Sheet, Point
4.4) or
(e) by taking legal action (see Article 43) or, provided that granting authority is the
European Commission or an EU executive agency, by adopting an enforceable
61Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
decision under Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and
Article 100(2) of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
If the Mutual Insurance Mechanism was called on by the granting authority to intervene,
recovery will be continued in the name of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism. If two debit
notes were sent, the second one (in the name of the Mutual Insurance Mechanism) will be
considered to replace the first one (in the name of the granting authority). Where the MIM
intervened, offsetting, enforceable decisions or any other of the above-mentioned forms of
enforced recovery may be used mutatis mutandis.
The amount to be recovered will be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in
Article 22.5, from the day following the payment date in the debit note, up to and including
the date the full payment is received.
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and
then against the principal.
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless
Directive 2015/236639 applies.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency, enforced recovery by
offsetting or enforceable decision will be done by the services of the European Commission
(see also Article 43).
22.5 Consequences of non-compliance
22.5.1 If the granting authority does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above), the
beneficiaries are entitled to late-payment interest at the reference rate applied by the
European Central Bank (ECB) for its main refinancing operations in euros, plus the
percentage specified in the Data Sheet (Point 4.2). The ECB reference rate to be used is the
rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as published
in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the
coordinator only on request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional
and local government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State
for the purpose of this Agreement).
If payments or the payment deadline are suspended (see Articles 29 and 30), payment will not
be considered as late.
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for
payment (see above), up to and including the date of payment.
39 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment
services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and
Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (OJ L 337, 23.12.2015, p. 35).
62Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.
22.5.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be
reduced (see Article 28) and the grant or the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 32).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 23 — GUARANTEES
Not applicable
ARTICLE 24 — CERTIFICATES
24.1 Operational verification report (OVR)
Not applicable
24.2 Certificate on the financial statements (CFS)
If required by the granting authority (see Data Sheet, Point 4.3), the beneficiaries must
provide certificates on their financial statements (CFS), in accordance with the schedule,
threshold and conditions set out in the Data Sheet.
The coordinator must submit them as part of the periodic report (see Article 21).
The certificates must be drawn up using the template published on the Portal, cover the costs
declared on the basis of actual costs and costs according to usual cost accounting practices (if
any), and fulfil the following conditions:
(a) be provided by a qualified approved external auditor which is independent and
complies with Directive 2006/43/EC40 (or for public bodies: by a competent
independent public officer)
(b) the verification must be carried out according to the highest professional standards to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the provisions under the Agreement
and that the costs declared are eligible.
The certificates will not affect the granting authority's right to carry out its own checks,
reviews or audits, nor preclude the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Public
Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) or the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) from using their
prerogatives for audits and investigations under the Agreement (see Article 25).
If the costs (or a part of them) were already audited by the granting authority, these costs do
not need to be covered by the certificate and will not be counted for calculating the threshold
(if any).

EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
24.4 Systems and process audit (SPA)
Beneficiaries which:
- use unit, flat rate or lump sum costs or contributions according to documented (i.e.
formally approved and in writing) usual costs accounting practices (if any) or
- have formalised documentation on the systems and processes for calculating their
costs and contributions (i.e. formally approved and in writing), have participated in at
least 150 actions under Horizon 2020 or the Euratom Research and Training
Programme (2014-2018 or 2019-2020) and participate in at least 3 ongoing actions
under Horizon Europe or the Euratom Research and Training Programme (2021-2025
or 2026-2027)
may apply to the granting authority for a systems and process audit (SPA).
This audit will be carried out as follows:
Step 1 — Application by the beneficiary.
Step 2 — If the application is accepted, the granting authority will carry out the systems
and process audit, complemented by an audit of transactions (on a sample of the
beneficiary’s Horizon Europe or Euratom Research and Training Programme
financial statements).
Step 3 — The audit result will take the form of a risk assessment classification for the
beneficiary: low, medium or high.
Low-risk beneficiaries will benefit from less (or less in-depth) ex-post audits (see Article 25)
and a higher threshold for submitting certificates on the financial statements (CFS; see
Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3).
24.5 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary does not submit a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) or the
certificate is rejected, the accepted EU contribution to costs will be capped to reflect the CFS
threshold.
If a beneficiary breaches any of its other obligations under this Article, the granting authority
may apply the measures described in Chapter 5.

On the basis of the audit findings, a draft audit report will be drawn up.
The auditors will formally notify the draft audit report to the beneficiary concerned, which
has 30 days from receiving notification to make observations (contradictory audit procedure).
The final audit report will take into account observations by the beneficiary concerned and
will be formally notified to them.
Audits (including audit reports) will be in the language of the Agreement.
25.2 European Commission checks, reviews and audits in grants of other granting
authorities
Where the granting authority is not the European Commission, the latter has the same rights
of checks, reviews and audits as the granting authority.
25.3 Access to records for assessing simplified forms of funding
The beneficiaries must give the European Commission access to their statutory records for the
periodic assessment of simplified forms of funding which are used in EU programmes.

statements or other personal data, including in electronic format) and allow access to sites and
premises for on-the-spot visits or inspections — as provided for under these Regulations.
To this end, the beneficiary concerned must keep all relevant information relating to the
action, at least until the time-limit set out in the Data Sheet (Point 6) and, in any case, until
any ongoing checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims have
been concluded.
25.5 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations — Extension of
findings
25.5.1 Consequences of checks, reviews, audits and investigations in this grant
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant
may lead to rejections (see Article 27), grant reduction (see Article 28) or other measures
described in Chapter 5.
Rejections or grant reductions after the final payment will lead to a revised final grant amount
(see Article 22).
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations during the action implementation may
lead to a request for amendment (see Article 39), to change the description of the action set
out in Annex 1.
Checks, reviews, audits or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities,
fraud or breach of obligations in any EU grant may also lead to consequences in other EU
grants awarded under similar conditions (‘extension to other grants’).
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF or EPPO investigation may lead to criminal
prosecution under national law.
25.5.2 Extension from other grants
Findings of checks, reviews, audits or investigations in other grants may be extended to this
grant, if:
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU grants awarded under similar
conditions, to have committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or
breach of obligations that have a material impact on this grant and
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the
list of grants affected by the findings — within the time-limit for audits set out in the
Data Sheet (see Point 6).
The granting authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned of the intention to
extend the findings and the list of grants affected.
If the extension concerns rejections of costs or contributions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected
67Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors, to calculate the amounts to be rejected, if the beneficiary concerned:
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or
practicable or
(ii) does not submit revised financial statements.
If the extension concerns grant reductions: the notification will include:
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and
(b) the correction rate for extrapolation, established on the basis of the systemic or
recurrent errors and the principle of proportionality.
The beneficiary concerned has 60 days from receiving notification to submit observations,
revised financial statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction
method/rate.
On the basis of this, the granting authority will analyse the impact and decide on the
implementation (i.e. start rejection or grant reduction procedures, either on the basis of the
revised financial statements or the announced/alternative method/rate or a mix of those; see
Articles 27 and 28).
25.6 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs or contributions
insufficiently substantiated will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article
27), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 28).
Such breaches may also lead to other measures described in Chapter 5.
ARTICLE 26 — IMPACT EVALUATIONS
26.1 Impact evaluation
The granting authority may carry out impact evaluations of the action, measured against the
objectives and indicators of the EU programme funding the grant.
Such evaluations may be started during implementation of the action and until the time-limit
set out in the Data Sheet (see Point 6). They will be formally notified to the coordinator or
beneficiaries and will be considered to start on the date of the notification.
If needed, the granting authority may be assisted by independent outside experts.
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact
of the action, including information in electronic format.
26.2 Consequences of non-compliance
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the granting authority may
apply the measures described in Chapter 5.

CHAPTER 5 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
SECTION 1 REJECTIONS AND GRANT REDUCTION
ARTICLE 27 — REJECTION OF COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
27.1 Conditions
The granting authority will — at beneficiary termination, interim payment, final payment or
afterwards — reject any costs or contributions which are ineligible (see Article 6), in
particular following checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 25).
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant
(see Article 25).
Ineligible costs or contributions will be rejected.
27.2 Procedure
If the rejection does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify the
coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection, the amounts and the reasons why. The
coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification —
submit observations if it disagrees with the rejection (payment review procedure).
If the rejection leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
27.3 Effects
If the granting authority rejects costs or contributions, it will deduct them from the costs or
contributions declared and then calculate the amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery;
see Article 22).
ARTICLE 28 — GRANT REDUCTION
28.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at beneficiary termination, final payment or afterwards —
reduce the grant for a beneficiary, if:
(a) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) the beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
69Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
The amount of the reduction will be calculated for each beneficiary concerned and
proportionate to the seriousness and the duration of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach
of obligations, by applying an individual reduction rate to their accepted EU contribution.
28.2 Procedure
If the grant reduction does not lead to a recovery, the granting authority will formally notify
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the reduction, the amount to be reduced and the
reasons why. The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving
notification — submit observations if it disagrees with the reduction (payment review
procedure).
If the grant reduction leads to a recovery, the granting authority will follow the contradictory
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 22.
28.3 Effects
If the granting authority reduces the grant, it will deduct the reduction and then calculate the
amount due (and, if needed, make a recovery; see Article 22).
SECTION 2 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
ARTICLE 29 — PAYMENT DEADLINE SUSPENSION
29.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline if a payment
cannot be processed because:
(a) the required report (see Article 21) has not been submitted or is not complete or
additional information is needed
(b) there are doubts about the amount to be paid (e.g. ongoing extension procedure,
queries about eligibility, need for a grant reduction, etc.) and additional checks,
reviews, audits or investigations are necessary, or
(c) there are other issues affecting the EU financial interests.
29.2 Procedure
The granting authority will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons
why.
The suspension will take effect the day the notification is sent.
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will
be lifted — and the remaining time to pay (see Data Sheet, Point 4.2) will resume.
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the granting authority to
confirm if the suspension will continue.
70Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the report and the
revised report is not submitted (or was submitted but is also rejected), the granting authority
may also terminate the grant or the participation of the coordinator (see Article 32).
ARTICLE 30 — PAYMENT SUSPENSION
30.1 Conditions
The granting authority may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part for
one or more beneficiaries, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5).
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the granting authority will make
partial payment(s) for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the final payment, the
payment (or recovery) of the remaining amount after suspension is lifted will be considered to
be the payment that closes the action.
30.2 Procedure
Before suspending payments, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
At the end of the suspension procedure, the granting authority will also inform the
coordinator.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent.
71Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The granting
authority will formally notify the beneficiary concerned (and the coordinator) and set the
suspension end date.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid to the beneficiaries concerned. For
interim payments, the periodic reports for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article
21) must not contain any financial statements from the beneficiary concerned (or its affiliated
entities). The coordinator must include them in the next periodic report after the suspension is
lifted or — if suspension is not lifted before the end of the action — in the last periodic report.
ARTICLE 31 — GRANT AGREEMENT SUSPENSION
31.1 Consortium-requested GA suspension
31.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the suspension of the grant or any part of it, if exceptional
circumstances — in particular force majeure (see Article 35) — make implementation
impossible or excessively difficult.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the suspension takes effect; this date may be before the date of the submission
of the amendment request and
- the expected date of resumption.
The suspension will take effect on the day specified in the amendment.
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately
request another amendment of the Agreement to set the suspension end date, the resumption
date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make other changes
necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the grant has been
terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the suspension end
date set out in the amendment. This date may be before the date of the submission of the
amendment request.
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for
activities implemented during grant suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
31.2 EU-initiated GA suspension
31.2.1 Conditions
The granting authority may suspend the grant or any part of it, if:
(a) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
or is suspected of having committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
72Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.), or
(b) a beneficiary (or a person having powers of representation, decision-making or
control, or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed
— in other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(c) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
specified in Annex 1, has been suspended or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA suspension grounds:
- the action has lost its scientific or technological relevance
- for EIC Accelerator actions: the action has lost its economic relevance
- for challenge-based EIC Pathfinder actions and Horizon Europe
Missions: the action has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for
which it has been initially selected.
31.2.2 Procedure
Before suspending the grant, the granting authority will send a pre-information letter to the
coordinator:
- formally notifying the intention to suspend the grant and the reasons why and
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the suspension (confirmation letter).
Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is discontinued.
The suspension will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification).
Once the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met, the granting authority
will formally notify the coordinator a lifting of suspension letter, in which it will set the
suspension end date and invite the coordinator to request an amendment of the Agreement to
set the resumption date (one day after suspension end date), extend the duration and make
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 39) — unless the
grant has been terminated (see Article 32). The suspension will be lifted with effect from the
suspension end date set out in the lifting of suspension letter. This date may be before the date
on which the letter is sent.
73Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
During the suspension, no prefinancing will be paid. Costs incurred or contributions for
activities implemented during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6.3).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the granting authority (see
Article 33).
Grant suspension does not affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant or a
beneficiary (see Article 32) or reduce the grant (see Article 28).
ARTICLE 32 — GRANT AGREEMENT OR BENEFICIARY TERMINATION
32.1 Consortium-requested GA termination
32.1.1 Conditions and procedure
The beneficiaries may request the termination of the grant.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the date the consortium ends work on the action (‘end of work date’) and
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no reasons are given or if the granting authority considers the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the grant terminated improperly.
32.1.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a
periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the basis of
the report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities
implemented before the end of work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after the end of work are not eligible.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account (no
costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Improper termination may lead to a grant reduction (see Article 28).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13 (confidentiality and
security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21 (reporting), 25
(checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant
reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.2 Consortium-requested beneficiary termination
32.2.1 Conditions and procedure
74Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The coordinator may request the termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries,
on request of the beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been
requested in writing)
- the date the beneficiary ends work on the action (‘end of work date’)
- the date the termination takes effect (‘termination date’); this date must be after the
date of the submission of the amendment request.
If the termination concerns the coordinator and is done without its agreement, the amendment
request must be submitted by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the consortium).
The termination will take effect on the termination date specified in the amendment.
If no information is given or if the granting authority considers that the reasons do not justify
termination, it may consider the beneficiary to have been terminated improperly.
32.2.2 Effects
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting
period until termination, containing an overview of the progress of the work, the
financial statement, the explanation on the use of resources, and, if applicable, the
certificate on the financial statement (CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data
Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a second request for amendment (see Article 39) with other amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated beneficiary;
change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of the
report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for activities
implemented before the end of work date (see Article 22). Costs relating to contracts due for
execution only after the end of work are not eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the
next reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline, only costs
and contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account
(no costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the
deadline, it will consider that:
75Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the second request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the second request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls into
question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of
applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 31) or grant
termination (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and visibility), 21
(reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact evaluation), 27
(rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims)) continue to apply.
32.3 EU-initiated GA or beneficiary termination
32.3.1 Conditions
The granting authority may terminate the grant or the participation of one or more
beneficiaries, if:
(a) one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 40)
(b) a change to the action or the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership
situation of a beneficiary is likely to substantially affect the implementation of the
action or calls into question the decision to award the grant (including changes linked
to one of the exclusion grounds listed in the declaration of honour)
(c) following termination of one or more beneficiaries, the necessary changes to the
Agreement (and their impact on the action) would call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants
(d) implementation of the action has become impossible or the changes necessary for its
continuation would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the
principle of equal treatment of applicants
(e) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is subject to bankruptcy
proceedings or similar (including insolvency, winding-up, administration by a
liquidator or court, arrangement with creditors, suspension of business activities, etc.)
(f) a beneficiary (or person with unlimited liability for its debts) is in breach of social
security or tax obligations
(g) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has been found guilty of
grave professional misconduct
(h) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed fraud,
76Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money laundering, terrorism-
related crimes (including terrorism financing), child labour or human trafficking
(i) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) was created under a
different jurisdiction with the intent to circumvent fiscal, social or other legal
obligations in the country of origin (or created another entity with this purpose)
(j) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed:
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or
(ii) serious breach of obligations under this Agreement or during its award
(including improper implementation of the action, non-compliance with the
call conditions, submission of false information, failure to provide required
information, breach of ethics or security rules (if applicable), failure to
cooperate with checks, reviews, audits and investigations, etc.)
(k) a beneficiary (or person having powers of representation, decision-making or control,
or person essential for the award/implementation of the grant) has committed — in
other EU grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or recurrent
errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact
on this grant (extension of findings; see Article 25.5)
(l) despite a specific request by the granting authority, a beneficiary does not request —
through the coordinator — an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of
one of its affiliated entities or associated partners that is in one of the situations under
points (d), (f), (e), (g), (h), (i) or (j) and to reallocate its tasks, or
(m) other:
(i) [OPTION 1 by default: linked action issues: not applicable] [OPTION 2 if
selected for the grant: the linked action (see Article 3) has not started as
specified in Annex 1, has been terminated or can no longer contribute, and
this impacts the implementation of the action under this Agreement]
(ii) additional GA termination grounds:
- the action has lost its scientific or technological relevance
- for EIC Accelerator actions: the action has lost its economic relevance
- for challenge-based EIC Pathfinder actions and Horizon Europe
Missions: the action has lost its relevance as part of the Portfolio for
which it has been initially selected.
32.3.2 Procedure
Before terminating the grant or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the granting
authority will send a pre-information letter to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:
- formally notifying the intention to terminate and the reasons why and
77Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- requesting observations within 30 days of receiving notification.
If the granting authority does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure
despite the observations it has received, it will confirm the termination and the date it will
take effect (confirmation letter). Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is
discontinued.
For beneficiary terminations, the granting authority will — at the end of the procedure — also
inform the coordinator.
The termination will take effect the day after the confirmation notification is sent (or on a
later date specified in the notification; ‘termination date’).
32.3.3 Effects
(a) for GA termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit
a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination).
The granting authority will calculate the final grant amount and final payment on the
basis of the report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and
contributions for activities implemented before termination takes effect (see Article
22). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after termination are not
eligible.
If the grant is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports, the coordinator
may not submit any report after termination.
If the granting authority does not receive the report within the deadline, only costs and
contributions which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
Termination does not affect the granting authority’s right to reduce the grant (see
Article 28) or to impose administrative sanctions (see Article 34).
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the granting authority
(see Article 33).
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
(b) for beneficiary termination:
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —
submit:
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned
(ii) a termination report from the beneficiary concerned, for the open
reporting period until termination, containing an overview of the progress
78Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
of the work, the financial statement, the explanation on the use of
resources, and, if applicable, the certificate on the financial statement
(CFS; see Articles 21 and 24.2 and Data Sheet, Point 4.3)
(iii) a request for amendment (see Article 39) with any amendments needed
(e.g. reallocation of the tasks and the estimated budget of the terminated
beneficiary; addition of a new beneficiary to replace the terminated
beneficiary; change of coordinator, etc.).
The granting authority will calculate the amount due to the beneficiary on the basis of
the report submitted and taking into account the costs incurred and contributions for
activities implemented before termination takes effect (see Article 22). Costs relating
to contracts due for execution only after termination are not eligible.
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report
for the next reporting period (see Article 21).
If the granting authority does not receive the termination report within the deadline,
only costs and contributions included in an approved periodic report will be taken into
account (no costs/contributions if no periodic report was ever approved).
If the granting authority does not receive the report on the distribution of payments
within the deadline, it will consider that:
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned
and that
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.
If the request for amendment is accepted by the granting authority, the Agreement is
amended to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 39).
If the request for amendment is rejected by the granting authority (because it calls
into question the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal
treatment of applicants), the grant may be terminated (see Article 32).
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 13
(confidentiality and security), 16 (IPR), 17 (communication, dissemination and
visibility), 21 (reporting), 25 (checks, reviews, audits and investigations), 26 (impact
evaluation), 27 (rejections), 28 (grant reduction) and 42 (assignment of claims))
continue to apply.
SECTION 3 OTHER CONSEQUENCES: DAMAGES AND ADMINISTRATIVE
SANCTIONS
ARTICLE 33 — DAMAGES
33.1 Liability of the granting authority
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to
third parties as a consequence of the implementation of the Agreement, including for gross
negligence.

EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The granting authority cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the
beneficiaries or other participants involved in the action, as a consequence of the
implementation of the Agreement.
33.2 Liability of the beneficiaries
The beneficiaries must compensate the granting authority for any damage it sustains as a
result of the implementation of the action or because the action was not implemented in full
compliance with the Agreement, provided that it was caused by gross negligence or wilful act.
The liability does not extend to indirect or consequential losses or similar damage (such as
loss of profit, loss of revenue or loss of contracts), provided such damage was not caused by
wilful act or by a breach of confidentiality.
ARTICLE 34 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES
Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as preventing the adoption of administrative
sanctions (i.e. exclusion from EU award procedures and/or financial penalties) or other public
law measures, in addition or as an alternative to the contractual measures provided under this
Agreement (see, for instance, Articles 137 to 148 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509 and
Articles 4 and 7 of Regulation 2988/9543).
SECTION 4 FORCE MAJEURE
ARTICLE 35 — FORCE MAJEURE
A party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement cannot
be considered in breach of them.
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of other participants
involved in the action) and
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without
delay, stating the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.
The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force
majeure and do their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.

CHAPTER 6 FINAL PROVISIONS
ARTICLE 36 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
36.1 Forms and means of communication — Electronic management
EU grants are managed fully electronically through the EU Funding & Tenders Portal
(‘Portal’).
All communications must be made electronically through the Portal, in accordance with the
Portal Terms and Conditions and using the forms and templates provided there (except if
explicitly instructed otherwise by the granting authority).
Communications must be made in writing and clearly identify the grant agreement (project
number and acronym).
Communications must be made by persons authorised according to the Portal Terms and
Conditions. For naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have designated —
before the signature of this Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’.
The role and tasks of the LEAR are stipulated in their appointment letter (see Portal Terms
and Conditions).
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the
Portal.
36.2 Date of communication
The sending date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time of
sending, as indicated by the time logs.
The receiving date for communications made through the Portal will be the date and time the
communication is accessed, as indicated by the time logs. Formal notifications that have not
been accessed within 10 days after sending, will be considered to have been accessed (see
Portal Terms and Conditions).
If a communication is exceptionally made on paper (by e-mail or postal service), general
principles apply (i.e. date of sending/receipt). Formal notifications by registered post with
proof of delivery will be considered to have been received either on the delivery date
registered by the postal service or the deadline for collection at the post office.
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be
considered in breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.
36.3 Addresses for communication
The Portal can be accessed via the Europa website.
The address for paper communications to the granting authority (if exceptionally allowed) is
the official mailing address indicated on its website.
For beneficiaries, it is the legal address specified in the Portal Participant Register.

ARTICLE 37 — INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT
The provisions in the Data Sheet take precedence over the rest of the Terms and Conditions of
the Agreement.
Annex 5 takes precedence over the Terms and Conditions; the Terms and Conditions take
precedence over the Annexes other than Annex 5.
Annex 2 takes precedence over Annex 1.
ARTICLE 38 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS AND DEADLINES
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7144, periods expressed in days, months or years are
calculated from the moment the triggering event occurs.
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.
‘Days’ means calendar days, not working days.
ARTICLE 39 — AMENDMENTS
39.1 Conditions
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement
which would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of
equal treatment of applicants.
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.
39.2 Procedure
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed directly in
the Portal Amendment tool.
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries
(see Annex 3). If a change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission
must be done by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).
The request for amendment must include:
- the reasons why
- the appropriate supporting documents and
- for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or
proof that this opinion has been requested in writing).
The granting authority may request additional information.
44 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to
periods, dates and time-limits (OJ L 124, 8/6/1971, p. 1).
82Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the tool within 45
days of receiving notification (or any additional information the granting authority has
requested). If it does not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same
deadline. The deadline may be extended, if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no
notification is received within the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected.
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.
An amendment takes effect on the date of entry into force or other date specified in the
amendment.
ARTICLE 40 — ACCESSION AND ADDITION OF NEW BENEFICIARIES
40.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble
The beneficiaries which are not coordinator must accede to the grant by signing the accession
form (see Annex 3) directly in the Portal Grant Preparation tool, within 30 days after the entry
into force of the Agreement (see Article 44).
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of
its entry into force (see Article 44).
If a beneficiary does not accede to the grant within the above deadline, the coordinator must
— within 30 days — request an amendment (see Article 39) to terminate the beneficiary and
make any changes necessary to ensure proper implementation of the action. This does not
affect the granting authority’s right to terminate the grant (see Article 32).
40.2 Addition of new beneficiaries
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with
Article 39. It must include an accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary
directly in the Portal Amendment tool.
New beneficiaries will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of their accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
Additions are also possible in mono-beneficiary grants.
ARTICLE 41 — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the
grant to a new beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.
The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment (see Article 39), with:
- the reasons why
- the accession form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary directly in the Portal
Amendment tool and
- additional supporting documents (if required by the granting authority).
83Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
The new beneficiary will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect
from the date of accession specified in the accession form (see Annex 3).
ARTICLE 42 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE
GRANTING AUTHORITY
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the granting
authority to any third party, except if expressly approved in writing by the granting authority
on the basis of a reasoned, written request by the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary
concerned).
If the granting authority has not accepted the assignment or if the terms of it are not observed,
the assignment will have no effect on it.
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations
towards the granting authority.
ARTICLE 43 — APPLICABLE LAW AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
43.1 Applicable law
The Agreement is governed by the applicable EU law, supplemented if necessary by the law
of Belgium.
Special rules may apply for beneficiaries which are international organisations (if any; see
Data Sheet, Point 5).
43.2 Dispute settlement
If a dispute concerns the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement, the parties
must bring action before the EU General Court — or, on appeal, the EU Court of Justice —
under Article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For non-EU beneficiaries (if any), such disputes must be brought before the courts of
Brussels, Belgium — unless an international agreement provides for the enforceability of EU
court judgements.
For beneficiaries with arbitration as special dispute settlement forum (if any; see Data Sheet,
Point 5), the dispute will — in the absence of an amicable settlement — be settled in
accordance with the Rules for Arbitration published on the Portal.
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under
Article 299 TFEU (see Articles 22 and 34), the beneficiaries must bring action before the
General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice — under Article 263 TFEU.
For grants where the granting authority is an EU executive agency (see Preamble), actions
against offsetting and enforceable decisions must be brought against the European
Commission (not against the granting authority; see also Article 22).
ARTICLE 44 — ENTRY INTO FORCE
The Agreement will enter into force on the day of signature by the granting authority or the
coordinator, depending on which is later.

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY (— ARTICLE 13)
Sensitive information with security recommendation
Sensitive information with a security recommendation must comply with the additional
requirements imposed by the granting authority.
Before starting the action tasks concerned, the beneficiaries must have obtained all approvals
or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task. The documents must be
kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting authority. If they
are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English summary.
For requirements restricting disclosure or dissemination, the information must be handled in
accordance with the recommendation and may be disclosed or disseminated only after written
approval from the granting authority.
EU classified information
If EU classified information is used or generated by the action, it must be treated in
accordance with the security classification guide (SCG) and security aspect letter (SAL) set
out in Annex 1 and Decision 2015/44448 and its implementing rules — until it is declassified.
Deliverables which contain EU classified information must be submitted according to special
procedures agreed with the granting authority.
Action tasks involving EU classified information may be subcontracted only with prior
explicit written approval from the granting authority and only to entities established in an EU
Member State or in a non-EU country with a security of information agreement with the EU
(or an administrative arrangement with the Commission).
EU classified information may not be disclosed to any third party (including participants
involved in the action implementation) without prior explicit written approval from the
granting authority.
ETHICS (— ARTICLE 14)
Ethics and research integrity
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:
48 Commission Decision 2015/444/EC, Euratom of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p. 53).
94Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity)
and
- applicable EU, international and national law, including the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms and its Supplementary Protocols.
No funding can be granted, within or outside the EU, for activities that are prohibited in all
Member States. No funding can be granted in a Member State for an activity which is
forbidden in that Member State.
The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality, the right to
privacy, the right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental
integrity of persons, the right to non-discrimination, the need to ensure protection of the
environment and high levels of human health protection.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action have an exclusive focus on
civil applications.
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action do not:
- aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes
- intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such
modifications heritable (with the exception of research relating to cancer treatment of
the gonads, which may be financed)
- intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose
of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or
- lead to the destruction of human embryos (for example, for obtaining stem cells).
Activities involving research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells may be
carried out only if:
- they are set out in Annex 1 or
- the coordinator has obtained explicit approval (in writing) from the granting authority.
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the fundamental principle of research integrity —
49
as set out in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity .
This implies compliance with the following principles:
- reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology,
the analysis and the use of resources
49 European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity of ALLEA (All European Academies).
95Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research
in a transparent, fair and unbiased way
- respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and
the environment
- accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and
organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts
and means that beneficiaries must ensure that persons carrying out research tasks follow the
good research practices including ensuring, where possible, openness, reproducibility and
traceability and refrain from the research integrity violations described in the Code.
Activities raising ethical issues must comply with the additional requirements formulated by
the ethics panels (including after checks, reviews or audits; see Article 25).
Before starting an action task raising ethical issues, the beneficiaries must have obtained all
approvals or other mandatory documents needed for implementing the task, notably from any
(national or local) ethics committee or other bodies such as data protection authorities.
The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the
granting authority. If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an English
summary, which shows that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the
conclusions of the committee or authority concerned (if any).
VALUES (— ARTICLE 14)
Gender mainstreaming
The beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities between men and
women in the implementation of the action and, where applicable, in line with the gender
equality plan. They must aim, to the extent possible, for a gender balance at all levels of
personnel assigned to the action, including at supervisory and managerial level.

Dissemination — The public disclosure of the results by appropriate means, other than
resulting from protecting or exploiting the results, including by scientific
publications in any medium.
Exploit(ation) — The use of results in further research and innovation activities other than
those covered by the action concerned, including among other things,
commercial exploitation such as developing, creating, manufacturing and
marketing a product or process, creating and providing a service, or in
standardisation activities.
96Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]

or background to which access is requested and/or the scope, duration or
other characteristics of the exploitation envisaged.
FAIR principles — ‘findability’, ‘accessibility’, ‘interoperability’ and ‘reusability’.
Open access — Online access to research outputs provided free of charge to the end-user.
Open science — An approach to the scientific process based on open cooperative work, tools
and diffusing knowledge.
Research data management — The process within the research lifecycle that includes the

publications, data or other engineered results and processes such as
software, algorithms, protocols, models, workflows and electronic
notebooks.
Scope of the obligations
For this section, references to ‘beneficiary’ or ‘beneficiaries’ do not include affiliated entities
(if any).
Agreement on background — Background free from restrictions
The beneficiaries must identify in a written agreement the background as needed for
implementing the action or for exploiting its results.
Where the call conditions restrict control due to strategic interests reasons, background that is
subject to control or other restrictions by a country (or entity from a country) which is not one
of the eligible countries or target countries set out in the call conditions and that impact the
exploitation of the results (i.e. would make the exploitation of the results subject to control or
restrictions) must not be used and must be explicitly excluded in the agreement on
background — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
Results free from restrictions
Where the call conditions restrict control due to strategic interests reasons, the beneficiaries
must ensure that the results of the action are not subject to control or other restrictions by a
country (or entity from a country) which is not one of the eligible countries or target countries
set out in the call conditions — unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority.
Ownership of results
Results are owned by the beneficiaries that generate them.
However, two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:
97Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- they have jointly generated them and
- it is not possible to:
- establish the respective contribution of each beneficiary, or
- separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their
protection.
The joint owners must agree — in writing — on the allocation and terms of exercise of their
joint ownership (‘joint ownership agreement’), to ensure compliance with their obligations
under this Agreement.
Unless otherwise agreed in the joint ownership agreement or consortium agreement, each
joint owner may grant non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the jointly-owned
results (without any right to sub-license), if the other joint owners are given:
- at least 45 days advance notice and
- fair and reasonable compensation.
The joint owners may agree — in writing — to apply another regime than joint ownership.
If third parties (including employees and other personnel) may claim rights to the results, the
beneficiary concerned must ensure that those rights can be exercised in a manner compatible
with its obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must indicate the owner(s) of the results (results ownership list) in the final
periodic report.
Protection of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must adequately protect their
results — for an appropriate period and with appropriate territorial coverage — if protection
is possible and justified, taking into account all relevant considerations, including the
prospects for commercial exploitation, the legitimate interests of the other beneficiaries and
any other legitimate interests.
Exploitation of results
Beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must — up to four years after the
end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1) — use their best efforts to exploit their results
directly or to have them exploited indirectly by another entity, in particular through transfer or
licensing.
If, despite a beneficiary’s best efforts, the results are not exploited within one year after the
end of the action, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the granting
authority) use the Horizon Results Platform to find interested parties to exploit the results.
If results are incorporated in a standard, the beneficiaries must (unless otherwise agreed with
the granting authority or unless it is impossible) ask the standardisation body to include the
funding statement (see Article 17) in (information related to) the standard.
98Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Additional exploitation obligations
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations (including obligations
linked to the restriction of participation or control due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy
or security reasons), the beneficiaries must comply with them — up to four years after the end
of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Where the call conditions impose additional exploitation obligations in case of a public
emergency, the beneficiaries must (if requested by the granting authority) grant for a limited
period of time specified in the request, non-exclusive licences — under fair and reasonable
conditions — to their results to legal entities that need the results to address the public
emergency and commit to rapidly and broadly exploit the resulting products and services at
fair and reasonable conditions. This provision applies up to four years after the end of the
action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Additional information obligation relating to standards
Where the call conditions impose additional information obligations relating to possible
standardisation, the beneficiaries must — up to four years after the end of the action (see Data
Sheet, Point 1) — inform the granting authority, if the results could reasonably be expected to
contribute to European or international standards.
Transfer and licensing of results
Transfer of ownership
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results, provided this does not affect
compliance with their obligations under the Agreement.
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under the Agreement regarding their
results are passed on to the new owner and that this new owner has the obligation to pass
them on in any subsequent transfer.
Moreover, they must inform the other beneficiaries with access rights of the transfer at least
45 days in advance (or less if agreed in writing), unless agreed otherwise in writing for
specifically identified third parties including affiliated entities or unless impossible under the
applicable law. This notification must include sufficient information on the new owner to
enable the beneficiaries concerned to assess the effects on their access rights. The
beneficiaries may object within 30 days of receiving notification (or less if agreed in writing),
if they can show that the transfer would adversely affect their access rights. In this case, the
transfer may not take place until agreement has been reached between the beneficiaries
concerned.
Granting licences
The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results (or otherwise give the right to exploit
them), including on an exclusive basis, provided this does not affect compliance with their
obligations.
Exclusive licences for results may be granted only if all the other beneficiaries concerned
have waived their access rights.
99Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing — Horizon Europe actions
Where the call conditions in Horizon Europe actions provide for the right to object to transfers
or licensing, the granting authority may — up to four years after the end of the action (see
Data Sheet, Point 1) — object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results,
if:
- the beneficiaries which generated the results have received funding under the grant
- it is to a legal entity established in a non-EU country not associated with Horizon
Europe, and
- the granting authority considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with EU
interests.
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally
notify the granting authority before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential
exploitation of the results, and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU
interests, in particular regarding competitiveness as well as consistency with
ethical principles and security considerations.
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the granting authority decides to object to a transfer or exclusive licence, it must formally
notify the beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional
information it has requested).
No transfer or licensing may take place in the following cases:
- pending the granting authority decision, within the period set out above
- if the granting authority objects
- until the conditions are complied with, if the granting authority objection comes
with conditions.
A beneficiary may formally notify a request to waive the right to object regarding intended
transfers or grants to a specifically identified third party, if measures safeguarding EU
interests are in place. If the granting authority agrees, it will formally notify the beneficiary
concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information requested).
Granting authority right to object to transfers or licensing — Euratom actions
Where the call conditions in Euratom actions provide for the right to object to transfers or
licensing, the granting authority may — up to four years after the end of the action (see Data
Sheet, Point 1) — object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive or non-exclusive licensing
of results, if:
100Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- the beneficiaries which generated the results have received funding under the grant
- it is to a legal entity established in a non-EU country not associated to the Euratom
Research and Training Programme 2021-2025 and
- the granting authority considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with the EU
interests.
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant a licence must formally notify the
granting authority before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the results, the new owner or licensee and the planned or
potential exploitation of the results, and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU
interests, in particular regarding competitiveness as well as consistency with
ethical principles and security considerations (including the defence interests of the
EU Member States under Article 24 of the Euratom Treaty).
The granting authority may request additional information.
If the granting authority decides to object to a transfer or licence, it will formally notify the
beneficiary concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information
requested).
No transfer or licensing may take place in the following cases:
- pending the granting authority decision, within the period set out above
- if the granting authority objects
- until the conditions are complied with, if the granting authority objection comes
with conditions.
A beneficiary may formally notify a request to waive the right to object regarding intended
transfers or grants to a specifically identified third party, if measures safeguarding EU
interests are in place. If the granting authority agrees, it will formally notify the beneficiary
concerned within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information requested).
Limitations to transfers and licensing due to strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security
reasons of the EU and its Member States
Where the call conditions restrict participation or control due to strategic assets, interests,
autonomy or security reasons, the beneficiaries may not transfer ownership of their results or
grant licences to third parties which are established in countries which are not eligible
countries or target countries set out in the call conditions (or, if applicable, are controlled by
such countries or entities from such countries) — unless they have requested and received
prior approval by the granting authority.
The request must:
101Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
- identify the specific results concerned
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation
of the results, and
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or license on the
strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security of the EU and its Member States.
The granting authority may request additional information.
Access rights to results and background
Exercise of access rights — Waiving of access rights — No sub-licensing
Requests to exercise access rights and the waiver of access rights must be in writing.
Unless agreed otherwise in writing with the beneficiary granting access, access rights do not
include the right to sub-license.
If a beneficiary is no longer involved in the action, this does not affect its obligations to grant
access.
If a beneficiary defaults on its obligations, the beneficiaries may agree that that beneficiary no
longer has access rights.
Access rights for implementing the action
The beneficiaries must grant each other access — on a royalty-free basis — to background
needed to implement their own tasks under the action, unless the beneficiary that holds the
background has — before acceding to the Agreement —:
- informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is subject to restrictions,
or
- agreed with the other beneficiaries that access would not be on a royalty-free basis.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access — on a royalty-free basis — to results needed
for implementing their own tasks under the action.
Access rights for exploiting the results
The beneficiaries must grant each other access — under fair and reasonable conditions — to
results needed for exploiting their results.
The beneficiaries must grant each other access — under fair and reasonable conditions — to
background needed for exploiting their results, unless the beneficiary that holds the
background has — before acceding to the Agreement — informed the other beneficiaries that
access to its background is subject to restrictions.
Requests for access must be made — unless agreed otherwise in writing — up to one year
after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Access rights for entities under the same control
102Project: [insert number] — [insert acronym] — [insert call identifier]
EU Grants: HE MGA — Multi & Mono: V1.2 – 01.11.2024
Unless agreed otherwise in writing by the beneficiaries, access to results and, subject to the
restrictions referred to above (if any), background must also be granted — under fair and
reasonable conditions — to entities that:
- are established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe associated country
- are under the direct or indirect control of another beneficiary, or under the same direct
or indirect control as that beneficiary, or directly or indirectly controlling that
beneficiary and
- need the access to exploit the results of that beneficiary.
Unless agreed otherwise in writing, such requests for access must be made by the entity
directly to the beneficiary concerned.
Requests for access must be made — unless agreed otherwise in writing — up to one year
after the end of the action (see Data Sheet, Point 1).
Access rights for the granting authority, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and
national authorities to results for policy purposes — Horizon Europe actions
In Horizon Europe actions, the beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant
must grant access to their results — on a royalty-free basis — to the granting authority, EU
institutions, bodies, offices or agencies for developing, implementing and monitoring EU
policies or programmes. Such access rights do not extend to beneficiaries’ background.
Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.
For actions under the cluster ‘Civil Security for Society’, such access rights also extend to
national authorities of EU Member States for developing, implementing and monitoring their
policies or programmes in this area. In this case, access is subject to a bilateral agreement to
define specific conditions ensuring that:
- the access rights will be used only for the intended purpose and
- appropriate confidentiality obligations are in place.
Moreover, the requesting national authority or EU institution, body, office or agency
(including the granting authority) must inform all other national authorities of such a request.
Access rights for the granting authority, Euratom institutions, funding bodies or the Joint
Undertaking Fusion for Energy — Euratom actions
In Euratom actions, the beneficiaries which have received funding under the grant must grant
access to their results — on a royalty-free basis — to the granting authority, Euratom
institutions, funding bodies or the Joint Undertaking Fusion for Energy for developing,
implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and programmes or for compliance with
obligations assumed through international cooperation with non-EU countries and
international organisations.

EIC Grants and HE EIT KIC Actions): Specific rules for access to research infrastructure
activities
Definitions
Research Infrastructures — Facilities that provide resources and services for the research
communities to conduct research and foster innovation in their fields. This
definition includes the associated human resources, and it covers major
equipment or sets of instruments; knowledge-related facilities such as
collections, archives or scientific data infrastructures; computing systems,
communication networks, and any other infrastructure, of a unique nature
and open to external users, essential to achieve excellence in research and
innovation. Where relevant, they may be used beyond research, for example
for education or public services, and they may be ‘single-sited’, ‘virtual’ or
‘distributed’51:
When implementing access to research infrastructure activities, the beneficiaries must respect
the following conditions:
- for transnational access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, transnational access to research infrastructure
or installations for selected user-groups.
The access must include the logistical, technological and scientific support and the
specific training that is usually provided to external researchers using the
infrastructure. Transnational access can be either in person (hands-on), provided
to selected users that visit the installation to make use of it, or remote, through the
50 Council Recommendation C/2023/1640 of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain
research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe, Annex II (OJ C, C/2023/1640, 29.12.2023).
51 See Article 2(1) of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme Regulation 2021/695.

provision to selected user-groups of remote scientific services (e.g. provision of
reference materials or samples, remote access to a high-performance computing
facility).
- categories of users that may have access:
Transnational access must be provided to selected user-groups, i.e. teams of one
or more researchers (users).
The majority of the users must work in a country other than the country(ies)
where the installation is located (unless access is provided by an international
organisation, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), an ERIC or similar legal entity).
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they have generated
under the action may benefit from the access (unless the users are working for
SMEs).
Access for user groups with a majority of users not working in a EU Member
State or Horizon Europe associated country is limited to 20% of the total amount
of units of access provided under the grant (unless a higher percentage is foreseen
in Annex 1).
- procedure and criteria for selecting user groups:
The user groups must request access by submitting (in writing) a description of
the work that they wish to carry out and the names, nationalities and home
institutions of the users.
The user groups must be selected by (one or more) selection panels set up by the
consortium.
The selection panels must be composed of international experts in the field, at
least half of them independent from the consortium (unless otherwise specified in
Annex 1).
The selection panels must assess all proposals received and recommend a short-
list of the user groups that should benefit from access.
The selection panels must base their selection on scientific merit, taking into
account that priority should be given to user groups composed of users who:
- have not previously used the installation and
- are working in countries where no equivalent research infrastructure exist.
It will apply the principles of transparency, fairness and impartiality.
Where the call conditions impose additional rules for the selection of user groups,
the beneficiaries must also comply with those.
- other conditions:

- ensure that its obligations under Articles 12, 13, 17 and 33 also apply to
the users
- keep records of the names, nationalities, and home institutions of users,
as well as the nature and quantity of access provided to them
- for virtual access:
- access which must be provided:
The access must be free of charge, virtual access to research infrastructure or
installations.
‘Virtual access’ means open and free access through communication networks to
digital resources and services needed for research, without selecting the users to
whom access is provided.
The access must include the support that is usually provided to external users.
Where allowed by the call conditions, beneficiaries may in justified cases define
objective eligibility criteria (e.g. affiliation to a research or academic institution)
for specific users.
- other conditions:
The beneficiaries must have the virtual access services assessed periodically by a
board composed of international experts in the field, at least half of whom must be
independent from the consortium (unless otherwise specified in Annex 1). For this
purpose, information and statistics on the users and the nature and quantity of the
access provided, must be made available to the board.
The beneficiaries must advertise widely, including on a dedicated website, the
access offered under the grant and the eligibility criteria, if any.
